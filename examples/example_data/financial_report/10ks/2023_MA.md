ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Item 1. Business

Overview

Mastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry. We connect
consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners,
businesses and other organizations worldwide by enabling electronic payments
instead of cash and checks and making those payment transactions safe, simple,
smart and accessible. We make payments easier and more efficient by providing
a wide range of payment solutions and services using our family of well-known
and trusted brands, including Mastercard®, Maestro® and Cirrus®. We operate a
multi-rail payments network that provides choice and flexibility for
consumers, merchants and our customers. Through our unique and proprietary
core global payments network, we switch (authorize, clear and settle) payment
transactions. We have additional payment capabilities that include automated
clearing house ("ACH") transactions (both batch and real-time account-based
payments). Using these capabilities, we offer integrated payment products and
services and capture new payment flows. Our value-added services include,
among others, cyber and intelligence solutions to allow all parties to
transact easily and with confidence, as well as other services that provide
proprietary insights, drawing on our principled use of secure consumer and
merchant data. Our investments in new networks, such as open banking solutions
and digital identity capabilities, support and strengthen our payments and
services solutions. Our franchise model sets the standards and ground-rules
for our core global payments network that balance value and risk across all
stakeholders and allows for interoperability among them. Our payment solutions
are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments ecosystem.

For a full discussion of our business, please see page 9.

Our Strategy

Our strategy centers on growing our core payments network, diversifying our
customers and geographies and building new capabilities through a combination
of organic and inorganic strategic initiatives. We are executing on this
strategy through a focus on three key priorities:

•expand in payments for consumers, businesses and governments

•extend our services to enhance transactions and drive customer value

•embrace new network opportunities to enable open banking, digital identity
and other adjacent network capabilities

Each of our priorities supports and builds upon each other and are
fundamentally interdependent.

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Our Key Strategic Priorities

Expand in payments.  We focus on expanding upon our core payments network to
enable payment flows for consumers, businesses, governments and others,
providing them with choice and flexibility to transact across multiple payment
rails (including cards, real-time payments, account-to-account transactions,
crypto and others) while ensuring that all payments are safe, secure and
seamless. We do so by:

•Driving growth in consumer payments with a focus on accelerating
digitization, growing acceptance and pursuing an expanded set of use cases,
including through partnerships

•Capturing new payment flows by expanding our multi-rail capabilities and
applications to penetrate key flows such as disbursements and remittances,
commercial point of sale transactions, business-to-business ("B2B") accounts
payable flows and consumer bill payments

•Leaning into new payment innovations such as our piloting in 2022 of
Mastercard Installments (our buy-now-pay-later solution) and developing
solutions that support digital currencies and blockchain applications

Extend our services. Our services drive value for our customers and the
broader payments ecosystem. These services include cyber and intelligence
solutions, insights and analytics, consulting, marketing services, loyalty,
processing and payment gateway solutions for e-commerce merchants. As we drive
value, our services generate revenue while helping to accelerate our overall
financial performance by supporting revenue growth in payments and new network
opportunities. We extend our services by:

•Enhancing the value of payments by making payments safe, secure, intelligent
and seamless

•Expanding services to new segments and use cases to address the needs of a
larger set of customers, including financial institutions, merchants,
governments, digital players and others, while expanding our geographic reach

•Supporting and strengthening new network capabilities, including expanding
services associated with digital identities and deploying our expertise in
open banking and open data, including with improved analytics

Embrace new network opportunities. We are building and managing new adjacent
network capabilities to power commerce and payments, creating new
opportunities to develop and embed services. We do so by:

•Applying our open banking solutions to help institutions and individuals
exchange consumer-permissioned data securely and easily by enabling the
reliable access, transmission and management of consumer data (including for
opening new accounts, securing loans, increasing credit scores and enabling
consumer choice in money movement and personal finance management)

•Enabling digital identity solutions to instill trust in the digital world and
ensure that payments across consumers, companies, devices and virtual entities
are efficient, safe and secure

Each of our priorities supports and builds upon each other and are
fundamentally interdependent:

•Payments provide data and distribution to drive scale and differentiation in
services and enable the development and adoption of new network capabilities

•Services improve the security, efficiency and intelligence of payments,
improve portfolio performance, differentiate our offerings, strengthen our
customer relationships and support our open banking and digital identity
platforms

•New network opportunities strengthen our digital payments value proposition,
including improved authentication with digital identity, and new opportunities
to develop and embed services in our expanding product offerings

Powering Our Success

These priorities are supported by six key drivers:

People. Our success is driven by the skills, experience, integrity and mindset
of our people. We attract and retain top talent from diverse backgrounds and
industries. Our people and our winning culture is based on decency, respect
and inclusion where people have opportunities to perform purpose-driven work
that impacts communities, customers and co-workers on a global scale. The
diversity and skill sets of our people underpin everything we do.

Brand. Our brands and brand identities serve as a differentiator for our
business, representing our values and enabling us to accelerate growth in new
areas.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Data. We use our data assets, infrastructure and platforms to create a range
of products and services for our customers, while incorporating our data
principles in how we design, implement and deliver those solutions. Our
Privacy by Design and Data by Design processes have been developed to ensure
we embed privacy, security and data controls in all of our products and
services, keeping a clear focus on protecting customers' and individuals'
data.

Technology.  Our technology provides resiliency, scalability and flexibility
in how we serve customers. It enables broader reach to scale digital payment
services to multiple channels, including mobile devices. Our technology
standards, services and governance model help us to serve as the connection
that allows financial institutions, financial technology companies (fintechs)
and others to interoperate and enable consumers, businesses, governments and
merchants to engage through digital channels.

Franchise. We manage an ecosystem of stakeholders who participate in our
network. Our franchise creates and sustains a comprehensive series of value
exchanges across our ecosystem. We provide a balanced ecosystem where all
participants benefit from the availability, innovation and safety and security
of our network and platforms. Our franchise enables the scale of our payments

Our Business

Our Multi-Rail Network and Payment Capabilities

We enable a wide variety of payment capabilities (including integrated
products and value-added services and solutions) over our multi-rail network
among account holders, merchants, financial institutions, businesses,
governments and others, offering our customers one partner for their payment
needs.

Payment Network

Our core payment network links issuers and acquirers around the globe to
facilitate the switching of transactions, permitting account holders to use a
Mastercard product at tens of millions of acceptance locations worldwide. This
network facilitates an efficient, safe and secure means for receiving
payments, a convenient, quick and secure payment method for consumers to
access their funds and a channel for businesses to receive insight through
information that is derived from our network. We enable transactions for our
customers through our core payment network in more than 150 currencies and in
more than 210 countries and territories.

Payment Network Transactions. Our core payment network supports what is often
referred to as a "four-party" payments network and includes the following
participants: account holder (a person or entity who holds a card or uses
another device enabled for payment), issuer (the account holder's financial
institution), merchant and acquirer (the merchant's financial institution).

We do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from
interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers, or
establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants'
acceptance of our products. In most cases, account holder relationships belong
to, and are managed by, our customers.

The following graphic depicts a typical transaction on our core payment
network and our role in that transaction, which includes payment security,
value-added services and the enablement of digital payments:

![ma-20221231_g16.jpg](ma-20221231_g16.jpg)

In a typical transaction, an account holder purchases goods or services from a
merchant using one of our payment products. After the transaction is
authorized by the issuer, the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the
value of the transaction, minus the interchange fee (described below) and
other applicable fees, and then posts the transaction to the account holder's
account. The acquirer pays the amount of the purchase, net of a discount
(referred to as the "merchant discount" rate), to the merchant.

•Interchange Fees. Interchange fees reflect the value merchants receive from
accepting our products and play a key role in balancing the costs and benefits
that consumers and merchants derive. Generally, interchange fees are collected
from acquirers and paid to issuers to reimburse the issuers for a portion of
the costs incurred. These costs are incurred by issuers in providing services
that benefit all participants in the system, including acquirers and
merchants, whose participation in the network enables increased sales to their
existing and new customers, efficiencies in the delivery of existing and new
products, guaranteed payments and improved customer experience. We (or,
alternatively, financial institutions) establish "default interchange fees"
that apply when there are no other established settlement terms in place
between an issuer and an acquirer. We administer the collection and remittance
of interchange fees through the settlement process.

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

•Additional Four-Party System Fees. The merchant discount rate is established
by the acquirer to cover its costs of both participating in the four-party
system and providing services to merchants. The rate takes into consideration
the amount of the interchange fee which the acquirer generally pays to the
issuer. Additionally, acquirers may charge merchants processing and related
fees in addition to the merchant discount rate. Issuers may also charge
account holders fees for the transaction, including, for example, fees for
extending revolving credit.

Switched Transactions

•Authorization, Clearing and Settlement. Through our core payment network, we
enable the routing of a transaction to the issuer for its approval, facilitate
the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and
acquirers after a successfully conducted transaction, and settle the
transaction by facilitating the exchange of funds between parties via
settlement banks chosen by us and our customers.

•Cross-Border and Domestic.  Our core payment network switches transactions
throughout the world when the merchant country and country of issuance are
different ("cross-border transactions"), providing account holders with the
ability to use, and merchants to accept, our products and services across
country borders. We also provide switched transaction services to customers
where the merchant country and the country of issuance are the same ("domestic
transactions"). We switch over 60% of all transactions for Mastercard and
Maestro-branded cards, including nearly all cross-border transactions.

We guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions from issuers to
acquirers to ensure the integrity of our core payment network. We refer to the
amount of this guarantee as our settlement exposure. We do not, however,
guarantee payments to merchants by their acquirers or the availability of
unspent prepaid account holder account balances.

Payment Network Architecture.  Our core payment network features a globally
integrated structure that provides scale for our issuers, enabling them to
expand into regional and global markets. It is based largely on a distributed
(peer-to-peer) architecture that enables the network to adapt to the needs of
each transaction. The network accomplishes this by performing intelligent
routing and applying multiple value-added services (such as fraud scoring,
tokenization services, etc.) to appropriate transactions in real time. This
architecture enables us to connect all parties regardless of where or how the
transaction is occurring. It has 24-hour a day availability and world-class
response time.

Additional Payment Capabilities

ACH Batch and Real-Time Account-Based Payments Infrastructure. We offer ACH
batch and real-time account-based payments capabilities, enabling payments for
ACH transactions between bank accounts in real-time. These capabilities
provide consumers and businesses the ability to make instant (faster) payments
while providing enhanced data and messaging capabilities. We build, implement,
enhance and operate real-time clearing and settlement infrastructure, payment
platforms and direct debit systems for jurisdictions globally. As of December
31, 2022, we either operated or were implementing real-time payments
infrastructure in 12 of the top 50 markets as measured by GDP. We also use our
real-time payments capabilities to enable new payment flows, such as consumer
bill payments using our real-time bill pay solutions.

Account-to-Account. We enable consumers, businesses, governments and merchants
to send and receive money directly from account-to-account. We apply these
capabilities to help these stakeholders with various disbursements and
remittances.

We discuss below under "Our Payment Products and Applications" the ways in
which we apply our real-time account-based and account-to-account payment
capabilities to capture new payment flows.

Security and Franchise

Payments System Security.  We have a multi-layered approach to protect the
global payments ecosystem. As part of this approach, we have a robust program
to protect our network from cyber and information security threats. Our
network and platforms incorporate multiple layers of protection, providing
greater resiliency and best-in-class security protection. Our programs are
assessed by third parties and incorporate benchmarking and other data from
peer companies and consultants. We engage in many efforts to mitigate
information security challenges, including maintaining an information security
program, an enterprise resilience program and insurance coverage, as well as
regularly testing our systems to address potential vulnerabilities. Through
the combined efforts of our Security Operations Centers, Fusion Centers and
the Mastercard Intelligence Center, we work with experts across the
organization (as well as through other sources such as public-private
partnerships) to monitor and respond quickly to a range of cyber and physical
threats.

As another feature of our multi-layered approach to protect the global
payments ecosystem, we work with issuers, acquirers, merchants, governments
and payments industry associations to develop and put in place technical
standards (such as EMV standards for chips and smart payment cards) for safe
and secure transactions and we provide solutions and products that are
designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments ecosystem. Our
approach includes supporting small businesses by

sharing best practices and providing access to free utilities and services,
benefiting both them and the entire payments ecosystem. We discuss specific
cyber and intelligence solutions that we offer to our customers in "Our Value-
Added Services".

Our Franchise. We manage an ecosystem of stakeholders that participate in our
network and payments platforms. Our franchise creates and sustains a
comprehensive series of value exchanges across our ecosystem. We ensure a
balanced ecosystem where all participants benefit from the availability,
innovation, safety and security of our network. We achieve this through the
following key activities:

•Participant Onboarding. We ensure the ability of new customers to use our
network and define the roles and responsibilities for their operations once on
the network

•Safety and Security. We establish the core principles, including ensuring
consumer protections and integrity, so participants feel confident to transact
on the network

•Operating Standards. We define the operational, technical and financial
policies to which network participants are required to adhere

•Responsible Stewardship. We establish performance standards to support
ecosystem growth and optimization and establish proactive monitoring to ensure
participant performance

•Issue Resolution. We operate a framework to enable the resolution of disputes
between our network participants

---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
  
As part of the security we bring to the payments ecosystem, we offer
integrated products and services to prevent, detect and respond to fraud and
cyber-attacks and to ensure the safety of transactions made using Mastercard
and non-Mastercard products. We do this using a multi-layered safety and
security strategy:

•The "Prevent" layer is designed to protect against attacks on infrastructure,
devices and data. We have continued to grow global usage of EMV chip and
contactless security technology, helping to reduce fraud. Our solutions
include Mastercard SafetyNet™, which protects financial institutions by
helping to stop real-time attacks that are visible in the network, but not
easily detected by financial institutions.

| | Key 2022 Developments|  
|

•In 2022, we significantly extended the reach of our Consumer Clarity
services, enhancing the value of payments by providing cardholders with
merchant details and digital receipts to reduce disputes, lower chargeback
costs and improve the consumer experience.

|  
  
•The "Identify" layer allows us to help banks and merchants verify the
authenticity of consumers during the payment process using various biometric
technologies, including fingerprint, face and iris scanning, and behavioral
user data assessment technology to verify online purchases on mobile devices,
as well as a card with biometric technology built in.

•The "Detect" layer spots fraudulent behavior and cyber-attacks and takes
action to stop these activities once detected. Our offerings in this space
include alerts when accounts are exposed to data breaches or security
incidents, fraud scoring technology that scans billions of dollars of money
flows each day while increasing approvals and reducing false declines, and
network-level monitoring on a global scale to help detect the occurrence of
widespread fraud attacks when the customer (or their processor) may be unable
to detect or defend against them.

•The "Experience" layer improves the security experience for our stakeholders
in areas from the speed of transactions (enhancing approvals for online and
card-on-file payments) to the ability to differentiate legitimate consumers
from fraudulent ones. Our offerings in this space include solutions for
consumer alerts and controls and a suite of digital token services. We also
offer an e-commerce fraud and dispute management network that enables
merchants to stop delivery when a fraudulent or disputed transaction is
identified, and issuers to refund the cardholder to avoid the chargeback
process.

•The "Network" layer extends the services we provide to transactions in the
payments ecosystem and across all of our rails, including decision
intelligence and tokenization capabilities, to help secure our customers and
transactions on a real-time basis.

Moreover, we use our artificial intelligence ("AI") and data analytics, along
with our cyber risk assessment capabilities, to help financial institutions,
merchants, corporations and governments secure their digital assets across
each of these five layers.

We have also worked with our customers to provide products to consumers
globally with increased confidence through the benefit of "zero liability",
where the consumer bears no responsibility for counterfeit or lost card losses
in the event of fraud.

Our efforts include:

•An annual cycle that aligns with our "Mastercard Way" and focuses on
objective setting, performance assessment, talent evaluation, skill
development, opportunities and career progression

•Succession planning for key roles, including talent and leadership programs
across various levels. These programs embed our culture principles, include
diverse populations, aim to develop talent and managerial skills through
personalized coaching and group executive development and leverage mentorship
programs and other learning opportunities

| | The Mastercard Way|  
| |  
|

The Mastercard Way is the statement of our culture: how we work and why we
work that way. It consists of three principles that address where we are going
as an organization, how we work together and how we deliver for our customers
and each other.

•Create value

•Grow together

•Move fast

|  
  
•A competitive compensation approach (subject to periodic reviews) under which
eligible employees across multiple job levels can receive long-term incentive
equity awards

•Contributions to employees' financial well-being as they plan for retirement.
All employees globally are entitled to receive a matching Mastercard
contribution of $1.67 for every $1 contributed to a 401(k) or other retirement
plan on the first 6% of base pay

•Continued expansion and prioritization of well-being offerings for employees,
including access to mental, physical and financial health resources,
additional paid time off due to COVID-related illness and dependent care, and
expanded benefits for family planning

•An evolved approach to flexible working, including the launch of a four-week
"work from anywhere" policy, meeting-free days and team-based decision-making
for how and where our employees work

•Support of employee charitable donations with matching Mastercard gifts of up
to $15,000 per employee annually, as well as providing full-time employees
five paid days per year for eligible volunteer work

•Experience surveys that we periodically run to assess our overall employee
engagement areas (with occasional focus on more targeted topics) and
prioritize how we address emerging opportunity areas

•A culture of high ethical business practices and compliance standards,
grounded in honesty, decency, trust and personal accountability. It is driven
by "tone at the top," reinforced with regular training, fostered in a speak-up
environment, and measured by our periodic employee surveys and other metrics
that enable our Board to maintain a pulse on areas of strength and
opportunities for improvement

| | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
  
Diversity, equity and inclusion underpin everything we do:

•We monitor our recruitment, development, succession and retention practices
with a focus on gender, race (in the U.S.) and generational mix of our
employee population

•We have developed regional and functional action plans to identify priorities
and actions that will help us make more progress for DEI, including
appropriate balance and inclusion in gender and racial representation

| | Workforce Demographics|  
| |  
|

•39% of our global workforce are women

•42% of our U.S. workforce are people of color 1

•Female employees earned $1.00 for every $1.00 men earned during 2022

•In the U.S., employees of color earned $1.00 for every $1.00 white employees
earned during 2022 1

•The median pay for female employees is 94.0% compared to male employees 2

|  
  
•We remain committed to our "In Solidarity" initiative through alignment of
our DEI plans globally to address local needs and opportunities, for example
through the introduction of new training programs such as our neurodiversity
hiring initiative and new partnerships with historically Black colleges and
universities (HBCUs) in the U.S.

•We remain dedicated to practices designed to ensure there is equal pay for
equal work. We have established a framework for examining pay practices
annually, supported by third-party analysis and benchmarked to the external
market. We assess compensation decisions for potential pay disparities by
gender (including base, bonus and long-term incentives), among other
categories, and appropriately respond to any disparities that are found

•Our employee incentive compensation plan features an ESG modifier that
includes quantitative goals for a number of ESG items, including gender pay
parity. In 2022, we expanded this modifier to all employees, underscoring our
commitment to ESG

We expect to provide more detailed information in 2023 regarding our
employees, including additional workforce demographics, in our annual
Corporate Sustainability Report and Proxy Statement, both of which will be
located on our website.

1People of Color are defined as Black or African American, Hispanic, Asian,
American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander and two
or more races. Ethnicity data does not include undeclared.

2Data as of September 30, 2022. The gender pay gap is predominantly due to the
fact that we have more men in senior roles, not because men are paid more.

Brand

![ma-20221231_g32.jpg](ma-20221231_g32.jpg)

Our family of well-known brands includes Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus. We
manage and promote our brands and brand identities through advertising,
promotions and sponsorships, as well as digital, mobile and social media
initiatives, in order to increase people's preference for our brands and usage
of our products. We sponsor a variety of sporting, entertainment and charity-
related marketing properties to align with consumer segments important to us
and our customers. Our advertising plays an important role in building brand
visibility, preference and overall usage among account holders globally. Our
"Priceless®" advertising campaign, which celebrated its 25th anniversary in
2022 and has run in more than 50 languages and in more than 120 countries
worldwide, promotes Mastercard usage benefits and acceptance, markets
Mastercard payment products and solutions and provides Mastercard with a
consistent, recognizable message that supports our brand around the globe.

Data

We use our data assets, infrastructure and platforms to create a range of
products and services for our customers, including the majority of our value-
added services, which help reduce fraud, increase security, provide actionable
insights to our customers to assist in their decision making and enable our
customers to increase their engagement with consumers. We do all this while
incorporating our data principles in how we design, implement and deliver
those solutions. Our Privacy by Design and Data by Design processes have been
developed to ensure we embed privacy, security and data controls in all of our
products and services, keeping a clear focus on protecting customers' and
individuals' data. We do this in a number of ways:

•Practicing data minimization. We collect and retain only the data that is
needed for a given product or service, and limit the amount and type of
personal information shared with third parties

•Being transparent and providing control. We explain how we use personal
information and give individuals' access and control over how their data is
used and shared

•Working with trusted partners. We select partners and service providers who
share our principled-approach to protecting data

•Addressing data bias. We ensure our use of advanced analytics, including AI
and Machine Learning, utilizes diverse data sets to create fair and inclusive
solutions that reflect individual, group and societal interests

•Advancing positive social impact. We utilize our data sets to create
innovative solutions to societal challenges, promoting inclusive financial,
social, climate, health and education growth

Technology

We leverage our technology to help enable payments, services and new networks,
enhance our operational strength and enable our employees to deliver
effectively for our customers. Our strategy to "lead through technology"
includes the following key areas:

Offering our products to customers around the world:

•Standardizing and simplifying how we connect with customers to provide them
with the tools to manage and expand their Mastercard relationship

•Deploying our cloud-native technology infrastructure to adapt to evolving
market conditions and further enhance speed, resiliency and scalability

Enabling our full range of products and services:

•Enhancing payment rails and expanding them across payments and services,
including providing seamless customer adoption across new services and
enhancing connectivity to new networks

•Further evolving our data infrastructure to unlock incremental value and
ensure ongoing compliance with evolving data regulations

Empowering our employees:

•Improving the speed in which we deliver for our customers through a
combination of tools and customer-centric practices

•Attracting, developing and retaining top technology talent, as well as
strengthening our employees' technology acumen

Revenue Sources

Mastercard is a payments network service provider that generates revenue from
a wide range of payment solutions we provide to our customers. We classify our
net revenues, which includes the impact of rebates and incentives, from
contracts with customers into two categories: (i) payment network and (ii)
value-added services and solutions.

Within our payment network, revenue is primarily generated from charging fees
to our customers based on GDV (which includes both domestic and cross-border
volume) on the cards that carry our brands and for providing switching and
other network-related services.

Within our value-added services and solutions, we generate revenue primarily
related to the following:

| | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
  
•Cyber and intelligence solutions

•Data and services solutions

•ACH batch and real-time account-based domestic and cross-border payments and
solutions

|

•Processing and gateway

•Open banking solutions

•Digital identity solutions  
  
See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations - Revenue" in Part II, Item 7 and Note 3, Revenue for more
detail about our revenue.

Intellectual Property

We own a number of valuable trademarks that are essential to our business,
including Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus, through one or more affiliates. We
also own numerous other trademarks covering various brands, programs and
services offered by us to support our payment programs. Trademark and service
mark registrations are generally valid indefinitely as long as they are used
and/or properly maintained. Through license agreements with our customers, we
authorize the use of our trademarks on a royalty-free basis in connection with
our customers' issuing and merchant acquiring businesses. In addition, we own
a number of patents and patent applications relating to payment solutions,
transaction processing, smart cards, contactless, mobile, biometrics, AI,
security systems, blockchain and other technologies, which are important to
our business operations. These patents expire at varying times depending on
the jurisdiction and filing date.

Competition

We face a number of competitors both within and outside of the global payments
industry. We compete in all categories of payment (including paper-based
payments and all forms of electronic payments) as well as in all categories in
which we provide value-added services and solutions:

•General Purpose Payments Networks. We compete worldwide with payments
networks such as Visa, American Express, JCB, China UnionPay and Discover,
among others. These competitors tend to offer a range of card-based payment
products. Some competitors have more market share than we do in certain
jurisdictions. Some also have different business models that may provide an
advantage in pricing, regulatory compliance burdens or otherwise. Globally,
financial institutions may issue both Mastercard and Visa-branded payment
products, and we compete with Visa for business on the basis of individual
portfolios or programs. In addition, a number of our customers issue American
Express, China UnionPay and/or Discover-branded payment cards in a manner
consistent with a four-party system. We continue to face intense competitive
pressure on the prices we charge our issuers and acquirers, and we seek to
enter into business agreements with them through which we offer incentives and
other support to issue and promote our payment products.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

•Debit and Local Networks. We compete with ATM and point of sale debit
networks in various countries. In addition, in many countries outside of the
United States, local debit brands serve as the main domestic brands, while our
brands are used mostly to enable cross-border transactions (typically
representing a small portion of overall transaction volume). Certain
jurisdictions have also created domestic card schemes focused mostly on debit.
In addition, several governments are promoting, or considering promoting,
local networks for domestic switching. See "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A
for a more detailed discussion of the risks related to payments system
regulation and government actions that may prevent us from competing
effectively.

•Real-time Account-based Payments Systems. We face competition in the ACH and
real-time account-based payments space from other companies (such as ACI
Worldwide, FIS and Volante Technologies) that provide infrastructure,
applications and services to support these payment solutions. As these real-
time account-based propositions mature, we face a possible increase in
competition for our existing domestic person-to-merchant ("P2M") and person-
to-person ("P2P") transaction market share. Similarly, as interlinking of
these infrastructures is further explored, they could disrupt our existing
cross-border P2M and P2P market share. Also, several industry initiatives are
experimenting with the concept of account-based global schemes, which could
lead to a disruption of the clearing and settlement options utilized in
various currencies.

•Alternative Payments Systems and New Entrants. As the global payments
industry becomes more complex, we face increasing competition from alternative
payments systems and emerging payments providers, both for customers and data.
Many of these providers, who in many circumstances can also be our partners or
customers, have developed payments systems focused on online activity in
e-commerce and mobile channels (in some cases, expanding to other channels),
and may process payments using in-house account transfers, real-time account-
based payments networks or global or local networks. Examples include digital
wallet providers (such as Paytm, PayPal, Alipay and Amazon), point of sale
financing/buy-now-pay-later providers (such as Klarna, Affirm and Afterpay),
mobile operator services, mobile phone-based money transfer and microfinancing
services (such as M-PESA) and handset manufacturers.

•Government-Backed Networks. Governments have been increasingly creating local
payments structures (such as the Brazilian Instant Payment System-PIX, FedNow
in the U.S., the European Payments Initiative, Nigerian NIBSS Card and the
South African Instant Payment System-Payshap), which are increasingly being
considered as alternatives to traditional domestic payment solutions and
schemes such as ours. In addition to local and regional networks, more than 80
national governments are exploring the use of central bank digital currencies
("CBDCs").

•Digital Currencies. Stablecoins and floating cryptocurrencies may become more
popular as they become more regulated and increasingly viewed as providing
immediacy, 24/7 accessibility, immutability and efficiency. Such currencies
have started to be accepted by P2M players (such as Square), while some banks
have started experimenting with blockchain B2B payments (such as J.P. Morgan).
These currencies have also introduced into the payments ecosystem an emerging
set of providers referred to as crypto natives, who have the ability to
disrupt traditional financial markets. The increased prominence of digital
currencies creates an opportunity for us but could equally compete with our
products and services.

•Value-Added Service Providers and New Network Capabilities Players. We face
competition from companies that provide alternatives to our value-added
services and solutions. These companies include information services and
consulting firms that provide consulting services and insights to financial
institutions, merchants and governments, technology companies that provide
cyber and fraud solutions, and companies that compete against us as providers
of loyalty and program management solutions. We also face competition from
companies that provide alternatives to our open banking and digital identity
solutions. Regulatory initiatives could also lead to increased competition in
this space.

Government Regulation

As a technology company operating in the global payments industry, we are
subject to government regulation that impacts key aspects of our business. In
particular, we are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in
the many countries in which our integrated products and services are used. We
are committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations and
implementing policies, procedures and programs designed to promote compliance.
We monitor and coordinate globally while acting locally and establish
relationships to assess and manage the effects of regulation on us. See "Risk
Factors" in Part I, Item 1A for more detail and examples of the regulation to
which we are subject.

| | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
  
Payments Oversight and Regulation. Central banks and other regulators in
several jurisdictions around the world either have, or are seeking to
establish, formal oversight over the payments industry, as well as authority
to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in their countries. Such
authority has resulted in regulation of various aspects of our business. In
the European Union, Mastercard is subject to systemic importance regulation,
which includes various requirements we must meet, including obligations
related to governance and risk management. In the U.K., the Bank of England
designated Vocalink™, our real-time account-based payments network platform,
as a "specified service provider", and Mastercard Europe as a "recognized
payment system", which includes supervisions and examination requirements. In
addition, European Union legislation requires us to separate our scheme
activities (brand, products, franchise and licensing) from our switching
activities and other processing in terms of how we go to market, make
decisions and organize our structure. Examples of other markets where
Mastercard is formally overseen include Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico and
South Africa. Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries are also regulated as
payments institutions, including as money transmitters. This regulation
subjects us to licensing obligations and regulatory supervision, as well as
various business conduct and risk management requirements.

Interchange Fees. Interchange fees that support the function and value of
four-party payments systems like ours are being reviewed or challenged in
various jurisdictions around the world via legislation to regulate interchange
fees, competition-related regulatory proceedings, central bank regulation and
litigation. Examples include statutes in the United States that cap debit
interchange for certain regulated activities, proposed legislation in the
United States to extend routing mandates to credit, our settlement with the
European Commission resolving its investigation into our interregional
interchange fees and the European Union legislation capping consumer credit
and debit interchange fees on payments issued and acquired within the European
Economic Area (the "EEA"). For more detail, see "Risk Factors - Other
Regulation" in Part I, Item 1A and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings)
to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.

| | Key 2022 Developments|  
|

•In 2022, the U.K. Payment Systems Regulator ("PSR") opened a market review of
network constraints in setting network fees and European Union/U.K. cross-
border interchange to determine whether the market is functioning in terms of
competition, innovation and promoting the interests of end users. The market
review will be a multi-year effort during which the PSR may make
recommendations for potential changes.

|  
|

•The U.S. Federal Reserve announced that, effective July 1, 2023, the
requirement for issuing customers to enable two unaffiliated networks for
routing debit card-present transactions will be extended to debit card-not-
present transactions.

|  
|

•In May 2022, legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate (but not voted on
prior to the end of the previous Congress) that would have extended routing
mandates for Mastercard and Visa to credit. The bill stipulated that the top
two networks could not be enabled on the same card, leaving room for regional
networks to serve as second options. The bill would also have mandated
Mastercard provide authentication, tokenization or other security technology
to competing networks, whether or not the transaction is switched by
Mastercard.

|  
|

•In December 2022, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Competition
voted to issue an administrative complaint and accept a consent agreement with
Mastercard related to our compliance with the debit routing provisions of the
Durbin Amendment. Pursuant to this agreement, we agreed to provide primary
account numbers (PANs) so merchants can route tokenized online debit
transactions to alternative networks.

|  
  
Preferential or Protective Government Actions.  Some governments have taken
action to provide resources, preferential treatment or other protection to
selected domestic payments and processing providers, as well as to create
their own national providers. For example, governments in some countries
mandate switching of domestic payments either entirely in that country or by
only domestic companies. In China, we are currently excluded from domestic
switching and are seeking market access, which is uncertain and subject to a
number of factors, including receiving regulatory approval. We are in active
discussions to explore different solutions. Some jurisdictions are currently
considering adopting or have adopted "data localization" requirements, which
mandate the collection, processing, and/or storage of data within their
borders. This is the case, for instance, in India, China and Saudi Arabia.

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Various forms of data localization requirements or data transfer restrictions
are also under consideration in other countries and jurisdictions, including
the European Union.

Anti-Money Laundering, Counter Financing of Terrorism, Economic Sanctions and
Anti-Corruption.  We are subject to anti-money laundering ("AML") and counter-
financing of terrorism ("CFT") laws and regulations globally, including the
U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act, as well as the various economic
sanctions programs, including those imposed and administered by the U.S.
Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"). We have implemented a comprehensive
AML/CFT program, comprised of policies, procedures and internal controls,
including the designation of a compliance officer, which is designed to
prevent our payments network from being used to facilitate money laundering
and other illicit activity and to address these legal and regulatory
requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing
risks. The economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC restrict financial
transactions and other dealings with certain countries and geographies
(specifically Crimea, the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's
Republic regions of Ukraine, Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria) and with
persons and entities included in OFAC sanctions lists including its list of
Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (the "SDN List"). We take
measures to prevent transactions that do not comply with OFAC and other
applicable sanctions, including establishing a risk-based compliance program
that has policies, procedures and controls designed to prevent us from having
unlawful business dealings with prohibited countries, regions, individuals or
entities. As part of this program, we obligate issuers and acquirers to comply
with their local sanctions obligations and the U.S. sanctions programs,
including requiring the screening of account holders and merchants,
respectively, against OFAC sanctions lists (including the SDN List). Iran and
Syria have been identified by the U.S. State Department as terrorist-
sponsoring states, and we have no offices, subsidiaries or affiliated entities
located in these countries and do not license entities domiciled there. We are
also subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations globally, including the
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, which, among
other things, generally prohibit giving or offering payments or anything of
value for the purpose of improperly influencing a business decision or to gain
an unfair business advantage. We have implemented policies, procedures and
internal controls to proactively manage corruption risk.

Financial Sector Oversight. We are or may be subject to regulations related to
our role in the financial industry and our relationship with our financial
institution customers. In addition, we are or may be subject to regulation by
a number of agencies charged with oversight of, among other things, consumer
protection, cybersecurity, financial and banking matters. The regulators have
supervisory and independent examination authority as well as enforcement
authority that we may be subject to because of the services we provide to
financial institutions that issue and acquire our products.

Issuer and Acquirer Practices Legislation and Regulation.  Our issuers and
acquirers are subject to numerous regulations and investigations applicable to
banks, financial institutions and other licensed entities, impacting us as a
consequence. Additionally, regulations such as the revised Payment Services
Directive (commonly referred to as "PSD2") in the EEA require financial
institutions to provide third-party payment processors access to consumer
payment accounts, enabling them to route transactions away from Mastercard
products and provide payment initiation and account information services
directly to consumers who use our products. PSD2 also requires a new standard
for authentication of transactions, which necessitates additional verification
information from consumers to complete transactions. This may increase the
number of transactions that consumers abandon if we are unable to ensure a
frictionless authentication experience under the new standards.

Regulation of Internet, Digital Transactions and High-Risk Merchant
Categories. Various jurisdictions have enacted or have proposed regulation
related to internet transactions. The legislation applies to payments system
participants, including us and our customers, and is implemented through a
federal regulation. We may also be impacted by evolving laws surrounding
gambling, including fantasy sports, as well as certain legally permissible but
high-risk merchant categories, such as adult content, firearms, alcohol and
tobacco.

Privacy, Data and Information Security.  Aspects of our operations or business
are subject to increasingly complex privacy and data protection laws in the
United States, the European Union and elsewhere around the world. For example,
in the United States, we and our customers are respectively subject to Federal
Trade Commission and federal banking agency information safeguarding
requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that require the maintenance of
a written, comprehensive information security program. In the European Union,
we are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR"), which
requires a comprehensive privacy and data protection program to protect the
personal and sensitive data of EEA residents. A number of regulators and
policymakers around the globe are using the GDPR as a reference to adopt new
or updated privacy and data protection laws. Due to increasing data collection
and data flows, numerous data breaches and security incidents as well as the
use of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, regulations in
this area are constantly evolving with regulatory and legislative authorities
in numerous parts of the world adopting proposals to regulate data and protect
information. In addition, the interpretation and application of these privacy
and data protection laws are often uncertain and in a state of flux, thus
requiring constant monitoring for compliance.

ESG. Various jurisdictions have adopted or are increasingly considering
adopting laws and regulations impacting our reporting on ESG governance,
strategy, risk management and metrics and targets. Regulations already adopted
or being considered include required corporate reporting and disclosures on
specific topics as well as broader ESG matters. Specific topics include
climate (such as the U.K. Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting, the
European Union Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, or "EU CSRD", and
the SEC proposed rules related to climate change) and human rights (such as
the European Union Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive). Broader
ESG matters include other environmental matters, treatment of employees and
diversity of workforce (such as the EU CSRD).

Additional Regulatory Developments. Various regulatory agencies also continue
to examine a wide variety of issues that could impact us, including evolving
laws surrounding buy-now-pay-later, digital currencies, marijuana, prepaid
payroll cards, identity theft, account management guidelines, disclosure
rules, security and marketing that would impact our customers directly.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Legal and Regulatory

Payments Industry Regulation

Global regulatory and legislative activity directly related to the payments
industry may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and
results of operations.

Jurisdictions increasingly have regulated or established and expanded
authority over certain aspects of payments systems such as ours, or have
sought to do so. These efforts established, and potentially further expand,
obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products and services
that we may offer, the countries in which our integrated products and services
may be used, the way we structure and operate our business and the types of
consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products or services. New
regulations and oversight could also relate to our clearing and settlement
activities (including policies, procedures and requirements related to risk
management, collateral, participant default, timely switching of financial
transactions, and capital and financial resource). Several jurisdictions have
also inquired about the network fees we charge to our customers (in some cases
as part of broader market reviews of retail payments).

Several central banks or similar regulatory bodies around the world have also
increased, or are seeking to increase, their formal oversight of the
electronic payments industry. In several jurisdictions, we have been
designated as a "systemically important payment system", with other regulators
considering similar designations. Parts of our business have also been deemed
as a "specified service provider" and considered critical national
infrastructure. These obligations, designations and restrictions result in
heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny. They may further expand and
could conflict with each other as more jurisdictions impose oversight of
payments systems. Moreover, these efforts may influence the approaches of
other regulators around the world that are increasingly looking to replicate
similar regulation of payments and other industries. Similarly, jurisdictions
that regulate a particular product may extend their regulation to similar
products (for example, debit regulations could lead to regulation of credit
products or network fees). As a result, the risks to our business created by
any one new law or regulation are magnified by the potential it has to be
replicated in other jurisdictions or involve other products within any
particular jurisdiction.

The expansion of our products and services as part of our multi-rail strategy
have also created the need for us to obtain new types and increasing numbers
of regulatory licenses, resulting in increased supervision and additional
compliance burdens distinct from those imposed on our core payment network
activities. For example, certain of our subsidiaries maintain money transfer
licenses to support certain activities. These licenses typically impose
supervisory and examination requirements, as well as capital, safeguarding,
risk management and other business obligations.

Increased regulation and oversight of payments systems, as well as increased
exposure to regulation resulting from changes to our products and services,
have resulted and may continue to result in significant compliance and
governance burdens or otherwise increase our costs. As a result, customers
could be less willing to participate in our payments system and/or use our
other products or services, reduce the benefits offered in connection with the
use of our products (making our products less desirable to consumers), reduce
the volume of domestic and cross-border transactions or other operational
metrics, disintermediate us, impact our profitability and/or limit our ability
to innovate or offer differentiated products and services, all of which could
materially and adversely impact our financial performance. In addition, any
regulation that is enacted related to the type and level of network fees we
charge our customers could also materially and adversely impact our results of
operations. Regulators could also require us to obtain prior approval for
changes to our system rules, procedures or operations, or could require
customization with regard to such changes, which could negatively impact us.
Such changes could lead to new or different criteria for participation in and
access to our payments system by financial institutions or other customers.
Moreover, failure to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are
subject could result in fines, sanctions, civil damages or other penalties,
which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results
of operations, as well as have an impact on our brand and reputation.

Increased regulatory, legislative and litigation activity with respect to
interchange rates could have an adverse impact on our business.

Interchange rates are a significant component of the costs that merchants pay
in connection with the acceptance of products associated with our core payment
network. Although we do not earn revenues from interchange, interchange rates
can impact the volume of transactions we see on our payment products. If
interchange rates are too high, merchants may stop accepting our products or
route transactions away from our network. If interchange rates are too low,
issuers may stop promoting our integrated products and services, eliminate or
reduce loyalty rewards programs or other account holder benefits (e.g., free
checking or low interest rates on balances), or charge fees to account holders
(e.g., annual fees or late payment fees).

Governments and merchant groups in a number of countries have implemented or
are seeking interchange rate reductions through legislation, competition law,
central bank regulation and litigation. See "Business - Government Regulation"
in Part I, Item 1 and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the
consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more
details.

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

If issuers cannot collect or we are required to reduce interchange rates,
issuers may be less willing to participate in our four-party payments system,
or may reduce the benefits offered in connection with the use of our products,
reducing the attractiveness of our products to consumers. These and other
impacts could lower transaction volumes, and/or make proprietary three-party
networks or other forms of payment more attractive. Issuers could reduce the
benefits associated with our products or choose to charge higher fees to
consumers to attempt to recoup a portion of the costs incurred for their
services. In addition, issuers could seek a fee reduction from us to decrease
the expense of their payment programs, particularly if regulation has a
disproportionate impact on us as compared to our competitors in terms of the
fees we can charge. This could make our products less desirable to consumers,
reduce the volume of transactions and our profitability, and limit our ability
to innovate or offer differentiated products.

We are devoting substantial resources to defending our right to establish
interchange rates in regulatory proceedings, litigation and legislative
activity. The potential outcome of any of these activities could have a more
positive or negative impact on us relative to our competitors. If we are
ultimately unsuccessful in defending our ability to establish interchange
rates, any resulting legislation, regulation and/or litigation may have a
material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations. In
addition, regulatory proceedings and litigation could result (and in some
cases has resulted) in us being fined and/or having to pay civil damages, the
amount of which could be material.

Limitations on our ability to restrict merchant surcharging could materially
and adversely impact our results of operations.

We have historically implemented policies, referred to as no-surcharge rules,
in certain jurisdictions, including the United States and Canada, that
prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using our
products instead of other means. Authorities in several jurisdictions have
acted to end or limit the application of these no-surcharge rules (or
indicated interest in doing so). Additionally, we have modified our no-
surcharge rules to permit U.S. and Canadian merchants to surcharge credit
cards, subject to certain limitations. It is possible that over time merchants
in some or all merchant categories in these jurisdictions may choose to
surcharge as permitted by the rule change. This could result in consumers
viewing our products less favorably and/or using alternative means of payment
instead of electronic products, which could result in a decrease in our
overall transaction volumes, and which in turn could materially and adversely
impact our results of operations.

Preferential or Protective Government Actions

Preferential and protective government actions related to domestic payment
services could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our
revenues.

Governments in some countries have acted, or in the future may act, to provide
resources, preferential treatment or other protection to selected national
payment and switching providers, or have created, or may in the future create,
their own national provider. This action may displace us from, prevent us from
entering into, or substantially restrict us from participating in, particular
geographies, and may prevent us from competing effectively against those
providers. For example:

•Governments in some countries have implemented, or may implement, regulatory
requirements that mandate switching of domestic payments either entirely in
that country or by only domestic companies.

•Some jurisdictions have implemented, or are considering, requirements to
collect, process and/or store data within their borders, as well as
prohibitions on the transfer of data abroad, leading to technological and
operational implications as well as increased compliance burdens and other
costs.

•Geopolitical events (such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine) and resulting OFAC
sanctions, adverse trade policies, enforcement of U.S. laws related to counter
financing of terrorism, economic sanctions and anti-corruption, or other types
of government actions could lead affected or other jurisdictions to take
actions in response that could adversely affect our business. Moreover, given
our decision to suspend business operations in Russia, other separate
jurisdictions may decide to increase their focus on growing local payment
networks and other solutions.

•Regional groups of countries are considering, or may consider, efforts to
restrict our participation in the switching of regional transactions.

Such developments prevent us from utilizing our global switching capabilities
for domestic or regional customers. In addition, to the extent a jurisdiction
determines us not to be in compliance with regulatory requirements (including
those related to data localization), we have, and may continue to be, subject
to resource and time pressures in order to come back into compliance. Our
inability to effect change in, or work with, these jurisdictions could
adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend
our global brand.

Additionally, some jurisdictions have implemented, or may implement, foreign
ownership restrictions, which could potentially have the effect of forcing or
inducing the transfer of our technology and proprietary information as a
condition of access to their markets. Such restrictions could adversely impact
our ability to compete in these markets.

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Privacy, Data and Security

Regulation of privacy, data, security and the digital economy could increase
our costs, as well as negatively impact our growth.

We are subject to increasingly complex regulations related to privacy, data
and information security in the jurisdictions in which we do business. These
regulations could result in negative impacts to our business. As we continue
to develop integrated and personalized products and services to meet the needs
of a changing marketplace (as well as acquire new companies), we have expanded
our information profile through the collection of additional data from
additional sources and across multiple channels. This expansion has amplified
the impact of these regulations on our business. This regulation requires
monitoring of and changes to our data practices in regard to the collection,
use, disclosure, storage, transfer and/or protection of personal and sensitive
information, as well as increased care in our data management, governance and
quality practices. We are also subject to enhanced compliance and operational
requirements in the European Union, and policymakers around the globe are or
are considering adopting new or updated privacy laws that have resulted or
could result in similar or stricter requirements in other jurisdictions. For
example, some jurisdictions have implemented or are otherwise considering
requirements to collect, process and/or store data within their borders, as
well as prohibitions on the transfer of data abroad, leading to technological
and operational implications. Other jurisdictions have adopted or are
otherwise considering adopting sector-specific regulations for the payments
industry, including forced data sharing requirements or additional
verification requirements, as well as regulations on artificial intelligence
and data governance, that overlap or conflict with, or diverge from, general
privacy rules. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and requirements
could result in fines, sanctions or other penalties, which could materially
and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business, as well
as have an impact on our reputation.

New requirements or changing interpretations of existing requirements in these
areas, or the development of new regulatory schemes related to the digital
economy in general, may also increase our costs and/or restrict our ability to
leverage data for innovation. This could impact the products and services we
offer and other aspects of our business, such as fraud monitoring, the need
for improved data management, governance and quality practices, the
development of information-based products and solutions, and technology
operations. In addition, these requirements may increase the costs to our
customers of issuing payment products, which may, in turn, decrease the number
of our payment products that they issue. Moreover, due to account data
compromise events and privacy abuses by other companies, as well as the
disclosure of monitoring activities by certain governmental agencies in
combination with the use of artificial intelligence and new technologies,
there has been heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny around the world
that could lead to further regulation and requirements and/or future
enforcement. Those developments have also raised public attention on
companies' data practices and have changed consumer and societal expectations
for enhanced privacy and data protection. While we make every effort to comply
with all regulatory requirements and we deploy a Privacy by Design and Data by
Design approach to all of our product development, the speed and pace of
changes in laws (as well as stakeholder interests) may not allow us to meet
rapidly evolving regulatory and stakeholder expectations. Any of these
developments could materially and adversely affect our overall business and
results of operations.

In addition, fraudulent activity and increasing cyberattacks have encouraged
legislative and regulatory intervention, and could damage our reputation and
reduce the use and acceptance of our integrated products and services or
increase our compliance costs. Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated
methods to capture consumer personal information to engage in illegal
activities such as counterfeiting or other fraud. As outsourcing and
specialization become common in the payments industry, there are more third
parties involved in processing transactions using our payment products. While
we are taking measures to make card and digital payments more secure,
increased fraud levels involving our integrated products and services, or
misconduct or negligence by third parties switching or otherwise servicing our
integrated products and services, could lead to legislative or regulatory
intervention, such as enhanced security requirements and liabilities, as well
as damage to our reputation.

Other Regulation

Regulations that directly or indirectly apply to Mastercard as a result of our
participation in the global payments industry may materially and adversely
affect our overall business and results of operations.

We are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the many
jurisdictions in which our integrated products and services are used. Many of
our customers are also subject to regulations applicable to banks and other
financial institutions that, at times, consequently affect us. Such regulation
has increased significantly in the last several years (as described in
"Business - Government Regulation" in Part I, Item 1). Examples include:

•Anti-Money Laundering, Counter Financing of Terrorism, Economic Sanctions and
Anti-Corruption \- We are subject to AML and CFT laws and regulations
globally. Economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC restrict financial
transactions and other dealings with certain countries and geographies, and
persons and entities. We are also subject to anti-corruption laws and
regulations globally, which, among other things, generally prohibit giving or
offering payments or anything of value for the purpose of improperly
influencing a business decision or to gain an unfair business advantage.

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

•Account-based Payments Systems \- In the U.K., aspects of our Vocalink
business are subject to the U.K. payment system oversight regime and are
directly overseen by the Bank of England.

•Issuer and Acquirer Practices Legislation and Regulation \- Certain
regulations (such as PSD2 in the EEA) may impact various aspects of our
business. For example, PSD2's strong authentication requirement could increase
the number of transactions that consumers abandon if we are unable to secure a
frictionless authentication experience under these standards. An increase in
the rate of abandoned transactions could adversely impact our volumes or other
operational metrics.

Increased regulatory focus on us has resulted and may continue to result in
significant compliance and governance burdens or otherwise increase our costs.
Similarly, increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause such
customers to reduce the volume of transactions processed through our systems,
or may otherwise impact the competitiveness of our products. Actions by
regulators could influence other organizations around the world to enact or
consider adopting similar measures, amplifying any potential compliance
burden. Additionally, our compliance with new economic sanctions and related
laws with respect to particular jurisdictions or customers could result in a
loss of business, which could be significant. Moreover, while our risk-based
compliance program obligates issuers and acquirers to comply with their local
sanctions programs (among other obligations), the failure of those issuers and
acquirers to identify potential non-compliance issues either during or after
their customer onboarding processes could ultimately impact our compliance
with economic sanctions and related laws. Finally, failure to comply with the
laws and regulations discussed above to which we are subject could result in
fines, sanctions or other penalties. In particular, a violation and subsequent
judgment or settlement against us, or those with whom we may be associated,
under economic sanctions and AML, CFT, and anti-corruption laws could subject
us to substantial monetary penalties, damages, and/or have a significant
reputational impact. Each instance may individually or collectively materially
and adversely affect our financial performance and/or our overall business and
results of operations, as well as have an impact on our reputation.

We could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and
interpretations or challenges to our tax positions.

We are subject to tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and
local governments as well as various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Current and
potential future changes in existing tax laws, including regulatory guidance,
are continuously being considered and have been or may be enacted (such as new
guidelines issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) which could impact how multinational enterprises are taxed on their
global profits). These changes have or may in the future impact our effective
income tax rate and tax payments. Similarly, changes in tax laws and
regulations that impact our customers and counterparties, or the economy
generally, have and can continue to impact us as well.

In addition, tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying
interpretations, and any significant failure to comply with applicable tax
laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to
substantial penalties and liabilities. Jurisdictions around the globe have
also increased tax-related audits, which require time and resources to
resolve.

Any changes in enacted tax laws, rules or regulatory or judicial
interpretations or guidance; any adverse outcome in connection with tax audits
in any jurisdiction; or any changes in the pronouncements relating to
accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our
effective income tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of
operations.

Litigation

Liabilities we may incur or limitations on our business related to any
litigation or litigation settlements could materially and adversely affect our
results of operations.

We are a defendant in a number of civil litigations and regulatory proceedings
and investigations, including among others, those alleging violations of
competition and antitrust law and those involving intellectual property claims
(as described in Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the
consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8). In the event
we are found liable in any material litigations or proceedings (particularly
in a large class-action lawsuit or on the basis of an antitrust claim
entitling the plaintiff to treble damages or under which we were jointly and
severally liable), we could be subject to significant damages, which could
have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of
operations.

Certain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years because
of litigation and litigation settlements, such as changes to our no-surcharge
rule in the United States and Canada. Any future limitations on our business
resulting from the outcomes of any litigation or regulatory proceeding,
including any changes to our rules or business practices, could impact our
relationships with our customers, including reducing the volume of business
that we do with them, which may materially and adversely affect our overall
business and results of operations.

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Business and Operations

Competition and Technology

Substantial and intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry
may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of
operations.

The global payments industry is highly competitive. Our payment programs
compete against competitors both within and outside of the global payments
industry and compete in all payment categories, including paper-based payments
and all forms of electronic payments. We compete against general purpose
payments networks, debit and local networks, ACH and real-time account-based
payments systems, alternative payments systems and new entrants (focused on
online activity across various channels and processing payments using in-house
capabilities), government-backed networks and digital currencies. We also face
competition from companies that provide alternatives to our value-added
services and new adjacent network capabilities (including open banking and
digital identity).

Our traditional competitors may have substantially greater financial and other
resources than we have, may offer a wider range of programs, services, and
payment capabilities than we offer or may use more effective advertising and
marketing strategies to achieve broader brand recognition and merchant
acceptance than we have. They may also introduce their own innovative
programs, value-added services and capabilities that adversely impact our
growth.

Certain of our competitors to our core payment network operate three-party
payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers and
these competitors may derive competitive advantages from their business
models. If we continue to attract more regulatory scrutiny than these
competitors because we operate a four-party system, or we are regulated
because of the system we operate in a way in which our competitors are not, we
could lose business to these competitors. See "Business - Competition" in Part
I, Item 1.

New entrants against whom we compete have developed alternative payments
systems, e-commerce payments systems and payments systems for mobile devices,
as well as physical store locations. A number of these new entrants rely
principally on technology to support their services that provides cost
advantages, and as a result may enjoy lower costs than we do, which could put
us at a competitive disadvantage.

Our ability to compete may also be affected by regulatory and legislative
initiatives, as well as the outcomes of litigation, competition-related
regulatory proceedings and central bank activity and legislative activity.
Moreover, the suspension of our business operations in Russia may provide the
opportunity for competitors to grow their business and increase their market
share and relative competitive position in other jurisdictions.

If we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, drive
value for our customers and/or effectively align our resources with our goals
and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively against these
threats. Our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing
competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business
and results of operations.

Disintermediation from stakeholders both within and outside of the payments
value chain could harm our business.

As the payments industry continues to develop and change, we face
disintermediation and related risks, including:

•Parties that process our transactions in certain countries may try to
eliminate our position as an intermediary in the payment process. For example,
merchants could switch (and in some cases are switching) transactions directly
with issuers. Additionally, processors could process transactions directly
between issuers and acquirers. Large scale consolidation within processors
could result in these processors developing bilateral agreements or in some
cases switching the entire transaction on their own network, thereby
disintermediating us.

•Industry participants continue to invest in and develop alternative
capabilities, such as account-to-account payments, which could facilitate P2M
transactions that compete with both our core payments network and our
additional payment capabilities.

•Regulation (such as PSD2 in the EEA) may disintermediate issuers by enabling
third-party providers opportunities to route payment transactions away from
our network and products and towards other forms of payment by offering
account information or payment initiation services directly to those who
currently use our products. Such regulation may also provide these processors
with the opportunity to commoditize the data that are included in the
transactions they are servicing. If our customers are disintermediated in
their business, we could face diminished demand for our integrated products
and services.

•Although we partner with fintechs and technology companies (such as digital
players and mobile providers) that leverage our technology, platforms and
networks to deliver their products, they could develop platforms or networks
that disintermediate us from digital payments and impact our ability to
compete in the digital economy. These companies may also develop products or

30 MASTERCARD 2022 FORM 10-K

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

services that compete with our customers within the payments ecosystem and, as
a result, could diminish demand for our products and services. When we do
partner with fintechs and technology companies, we face a heightened risk when
we share data as part of those relationships. While we share this data in a
controlled manner subject to applicable anonymization and privacy and data
standards, sharing this data without proper oversight could provide partners
with a competitive advantage.

•Competitors, customers, fintechs, technology companies, governments and other
industry participants may develop products that compete with or replace value-
added products and services we currently provide to support our switched
transaction and payments offerings. These products could either replace, or
force us to change our pricing or practices, for these offerings. In addition,
governments that develop or encourage the creation of national or
international payments platforms may promote their platforms in such a way
that could put us at a competitive disadvantage in those markets, or require
us to compete differently.

•Participants in the payments industry may merge, create joint ventures or
form other business combinations that may strengthen their existing business
services or create new payment products and services that compete with our
products and services.

Our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive
threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results
of operations.

Continued intense pricing pressure may materially and adversely affect our
overall business and results of operations.

In order to increase transaction volumes, enter new markets and expand our
products and services, we seek to enter into business agreements with
customers through which we offer incentives, pricing discounts and other
support that promote our products. In order to stay competitive, we may have
to increase the amount of these incentives and pricing discounts. We continue
to experience pricing pressure. The demand from our customers for better
pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives moderates our growth.
We may not be able to continue our expansion strategy to switch additional
transaction volumes or to provide additional services to our customers at
levels sufficient to compensate for such lower fees or increased costs in the
future, which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and
results of operations. In addition, increased pressure on prices increases the
importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other
than those relating to customer incentives.

In the future, we may not be able to enter into agreements with our customers
if they require terms that we are unable or unwilling to offer, and we may be
required to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships and
to compete with others in the industry. Some of our competitors are larger
with greater financial resources and accordingly may be able to charge lower
prices to our customers. In addition, to the extent that we offer discounts or
incentives under such agreements, we will need to further increase transaction
volumes or the amount of services provided thereunder in order to benefit
incrementally from such agreements and to increase revenue and profit, and we
may not be successful in doing so, particularly in the current regulatory
environment. Our customers also may implement cost reduction initiatives that
reduce or eliminate payment product marketing or increase requests for greater
incentives or greater cost stability. These factors could have a material
adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.

Additionally, we face pricing pressure related to real-time account-based
payment schemes and cross-border payments. These pressures include the
increased use of domestic real-time account-based payment schemes offering
increasingly lower or subsidized pricing for P2M transactions as well as
continued downward pressure on pricing for cross-border payments resulting
from competition from real-time account-based payment schemes and from
initiatives to lower the cost of cross-border payments to end users (such as
the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-border Payments). These factors could have
a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.

Rapid and significant technological developments and changes could negatively
impact our overall business and results of operations or limit our future
growth.

The payments industry is subject to rapid and significant technological
changes, which can impact our business in several ways:

•Technological changes, including continuing developments of technologies in
the areas of smart cards and devices, contactless and mobile payments,
e-commerce, cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, machine learning and AI,
could result in new technologies that may be superior to, or render obsolete,
the technologies we currently use in our programs and services. Moreover,
these changes could result in new and innovative payment methods and products
that could place us at a competitive disadvantage and that could reduce the
use of our products.

•We rely in part on third parties (including some of our competitors and
potential competitors) for the development of and access to new technologies.
The inability of these companies to keep pace with technological developments,
or the acquisition of these companies by competitors, could negatively impact
our offerings.

  

MASTERCARD 2022 FORM 10-K 31

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

•Our ability to develop and adopt new services and technologies may be
inhibited by industry-wide solutions and standards (such as those related to
EMV, tokenization or other safety and security technologies), and by
resistance from customers or merchants to such changes.

•Our ability to develop evolving systems and products may be inhibited by any
difficulty we may experience in attracting and retaining employees with
technology expertise.

•Our ability to adopt these technologies can also be inhibited by intellectual
property rights of third parties. We have received, and we may in the future
receive, notices or inquiries from patent holders (for example, other
operating companies or non-practicing entities) suggesting that we may be
infringing certain patents or that we need to license the use of their patents
to avoid infringement. Such notices may, among other things, threaten
litigation against us or our customers or demand significant license fees.

•Our ability to develop new technologies and reflect technological changes in
our payments offerings requires resources, which has resulted in and may
further result in additional expenses.

•We work with fintechs, technology companies (such as digital players and
mobile providers) and traditional customers that use our technology to enhance
payment safety and security and to deliver their payment-related products and
services quickly and efficiently to consumers. Our inability to keep pace
technologically could negatively impact the willingness of these customers to
work with us, and could encourage them to use their own technology and compete
against us.

•Regulatory or government requirements have and could continue to require us
to host and deliver certain products and services on-soil in certain markets,
requiring us to alter our technology and delivery model, potentially resulting
in additional expenses.

•Various central banks are experimenting with digital currencies called
Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). CBDCs may be launched with their own
networks to transfer money between participants. Policy and design
considerations that governments adopt could impact the extent of our role in
facilitating CBDC-based payment transactions, potentially impacting the
transactions that we may process over our network.

We cannot predict the effect of future technological changes on our business,
and our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate,
develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards.
Failure to keep pace with these technological developments or otherwise bring
to market products that reflect these technologies could lead to a decline in
the use of our products, which could have a material adverse impact on our
overall business and results of operations.

Operating a real-time account-based payments network presents risks that could
materially affect our business.

U.K. regulators have designated Vocalink, our real-time account-based payments
network platform, to be a "specified service provider" and regulators in other
countries may in the future expand their regulatory oversight of real-time
account-based payments systems in similar ways. In addition, any prolonged
service outage on this network could result in quickly escalating impacts,
including potential intervention by the Bank of England and significant
reputational risk to Vocalink and us. For a discussion of the regulatory risks
related to our real-time account-based payments platform and oversight by
regulators, see our risk factor in "Risk Factors - Payments Industry
Regulation" in this Part I, Item 1A. Furthermore, the complexity of this
payment technology requires careful management to address security
vulnerabilities that are different from those faced on our core payment
network. Operational difficulties, such as the temporary unavailability of our
services or products, or security breaches on our real-time account-based
payments network could cause a loss of business for these products and
services, result in potential liability for us and adversely affect our
reputation.

Working with new customers and end users as we expand our multi-rail solutions
and integrated products and services can present operational and onboarding
challenges, be costly and result in reputational damage if the new products or
services do not perform as intended.

The payments markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid
technological change, new product introductions, evolving industry standards
and changing customer and consumer needs. In order to remain competitive and
meet the needs of the payments markets, we are continually involved in
developing complex multi-rail solutions and diversifying our integrated
products and services. These efforts carry the risks associated with any
diversification initiative, including cost overruns, delays in delivery and
performance problems. These projects also carry risks associated with working
with different types of customers, for example organizations such as
corporations that are not financial institutions and non-governmental
organizations ("NGOs"), and end users other than those we have traditionally
worked with. These differences may present new operational challenges in the
development and implementation of our new products or services. These new
customers are typically less regulated, and as a result, enhanced
infrastructure and monitoring is required.

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Our failure to effectively design and deliver these multi-rail solutions and
integrated products and services could make our other offerings less desirable
to these customers, or put us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, if
there is a delay in the implementation of our products or services (which
could include compliance obligations, such as AML and CFT, and licensing
requirements for our products and services that operate under regulatory
licenses), if our products or services do not perform as anticipated, or we
are unable to otherwise adequately anticipate risks related to new types of
customers, we could face additional regulatory scrutiny, fines, sanctions or
other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our overall
business and results of operations, as well as negatively impact our brand and
reputation.

Information Security and Operational Resilience

Information security incidents or account data compromise events could disrupt
our business, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.

Information security risks for payments and technology companies such as ours
have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the
proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and
telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the
increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers,
terrorists and other external parties. These threats may derive from fraud or
malice on the part of our employees or third parties, or may result from human
error or accidental technological failure. These threats include cyber-attacks
such as computer viruses, malicious code (including ransomware), phishing
attacks or information security breaches and could lead to the
misappropriation of consumer account and other information and identity theft.
These types of threats have risen significantly due to a significant portion
of our workforce working in a remote or hybrid environment.

Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of
confidential, proprietary and other information and technology in our computer
systems and networks, as well as the systems of our third-party providers. Our
customers and other parties in the payments value chain, as well as account
holders, rely on our digital technologies, computer systems, software and
networks to conduct their operations. In addition, to access our integrated
products and services, our customers and account holders increasingly use
personal smartphones, tablet PCs and other mobile devices that may be beyond
our control. We, like other financial technology organizations, routinely are
subject to cyber-threats and our technologies, systems and networks, as well
as the systems of our third-party providers, have been subject to attempted
cyber-attacks. Because of our position in the payments value chain, we believe
that we are likely to continue to be a target of such threats and attacks. In
response to U.S. and European sanctions against Russia earlier this year, we
saw increased information security threats from state sponsored actors. Other
geopolitical events and resulting government activity could also lead to
information security threats and attacks by affected or sympathizing
jurisdictions or other actors, which could put our information and assets at
risk, as well as result in network disruption.

To date, we have not experienced any material impact relating to cyber-attacks
or other information security breaches. However, future attacks or breaches
could lead to security breaches of the networks, systems (including third-
party provider systems) or devices that our customers use to access our
integrated products and services, which in turn could result in the
unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or
destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information (including
account data information) or data security compromises. Such attacks or
breaches could also cause service interruptions, malfunctions or other
failures in the physical infrastructure or operations systems that support our
businesses and customers (such as the lack of availability of our value-added
services), as well as the operations of our customers or other third parties.
In addition, they could lead to damage to our reputation with our customers,
other stakeholders and the broader payments ecosystem, additional costs to us
(such as repairing systems, adding new personnel or protection technologies or
compliance costs), regulatory penalties, financial losses to both us and our
customers and partners and the loss of customers and business opportunities.
These consequences could be further pronounced in jurisdictions in which we
are deemed critical national infrastructure. If such attacks are not detected
immediately, their effect could be compounded.

Despite various mitigation efforts that we undertake, there can be no
assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer material
breaches and resulting losses in the future, or that our insurance coverage
would be sufficient to cover all losses. Our risk and exposure to these
matters remain heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature
of these threats, our prominent size and scale and our role in the global
payments and technology industries, our plans to continue to implement our
digital and mobile channel strategies and develop additional remote
connectivity solutions to serve our customers and account holders when and how
they want to be served, our global presence, our extensive use of third-party
vendors and future joint venture and merger and acquisition opportunities. As
a result, information security and the continued development and enhancement
of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems,
computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized
access remain a priority for us. As cyber-threats continue to evolve, we may
be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify
or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any
information security vulnerabilities. Any of the risks described above could
materially adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

In addition to information security risks for our systems, we also routinely
encounter account data compromise events involving merchants and third-party
payment processors that process, store or transmit payment transaction data,
which affect millions of Mastercard, Visa, Discover, American Express and
other types of account holders. Further events of this type may subject us to
reputational damage and/or lawsuits involving payment products carrying our
brands. Damage to our reputation or that of our brands resulting from an
account data breach of either our systems or the systems of our customers,
merchants and other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our
integrated products and services. Such events could also slow or reverse the
trend toward electronic payments. In addition to reputational concerns, the
cumulative impact of multiple account data compromise events could increase
the impact of the fraud resulting from such events by, among other things,
making it more difficult to identify consumers. Moreover, while most of the
lawsuits resulting from account data breaches do not involve direct claims
against us and while we have releases from many issuers and acquirers, we
could still face damage claims, which, if upheld, could materially and
adversely affect our results of operations. Such events could have a material
adverse impact on our transaction volumes, results of operations and prospects
for future growth, or increase our costs by leading to additional regulatory
burdens being imposed on us.

Service disruptions that cause us to be unable to process transactions or
service our customers could reduce our operational resilience and materially
affect our overall business and results of operations.

Our transaction switching systems and other offerings have experienced in
limited instances and may continue to experience interruptions as a result of
technology malfunctions, fire, weather events, power outages,
telecommunications disruptions, terrorism, workplace violence, accidents or
other catastrophic events (including those related to climate change). Our
visibility in the global payments industry may also put us at greater risk of
attack by terrorists, activists, or hackers who intend to disrupt our
facilities and/or systems. Additionally, we rely on third-party service
providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data
network. Inadequate infrastructure in lesser-developed markets could also
result in service disruptions, which could impact our ability to do business
in those markets. If one of our service providers fails to provide the
communications capacity or services we require, as a result of natural
disaster, operational disruptions, terrorism, hacking or any other reason, the
failure could interrupt our services. Although we maintain an enterprise
resiliency program to analyze risk, assess potential impacts, and develop
effective response strategies, we cannot ensure that our business would be
immune to these risks, because of the intrinsic importance of our switching
systems to our business, any interruption or degradation could adversely
affect the perception of the reliability of products carrying our brands and
materially adversely affect our overall business and our results of
operations.

Stakeholder Relationships

Losing a significant portion of business from one or more of our largest
customers could lead to significant revenue decreases in the longer term,
which could have a material adverse impact on our business and our results of
operations.

Many of our customer relationships are not exclusive. Our customers can
reassess their future commitments to us subject to the terms of our contracts,
and they separately may develop their own services that compete with ours. Our
business agreements with these customers may not ultimately reduce the risk
inherent in our business that customers may terminate their relationships with
us in favor of relationships with our competitors, or for other reasons, or
might not meet their contractual obligations to us.

In addition, a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our
five largest customers. Loss of business from any of our large customers could
have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of
operations.

Exclusive/near exclusive relationships certain customers have with our
competitors may have a material adverse impact on our business.

While we have exclusive, or nearly-exclusive, relationships with certain of
our customers to issue payment products, other customers have similar
exclusive, or nearly-exclusive, relationships with our competitors. These
relationships may make it difficult or cost-prohibitive for us to do
significant amounts of business with these customers to increase our revenues.
In addition, these customers may be more successful and may grow faster than
the customers that primarily issue our payment products, which could put us at
a competitive disadvantage. Furthermore, we earn substantial revenue from
customers with nearly-exclusive relationships with our competitors. Such
relationships could provide advantages to the customers to shift business from
us to the competitors with which they are principally aligned. A significant
loss of our existing revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could
have a material adverse impact on our business.

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Consolidation amongst our customers could materially and adversely affect our
overall business and results of operations.

Our customers' industries have undergone substantial, accelerated
consolidation in the past. These consolidations have included customers with a
substantial Mastercard portfolio being acquired by institutions with a strong
relationship with a competitor. If significant consolidation among customers
were to continue, it could result in the substantial loss of business for us,
which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects. In
addition, one or more of our customers could seek to merge with, or acquire,
one of our competitors, and any such transaction could also have a material
adverse impact on our overall business. Consolidation could also produce a
smaller number of large customers, which could increase their bargaining power
and lead to lower prices and/or more favorable terms for our customers. These
developments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.

Our business significantly depends on the continued success and
competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and, in many
jurisdictions, their ability to effectively manage or help manage our brands.

While we work directly with many stakeholders in the payments system,
including merchants, governments, fintechs and large digital companies and
other technology companies, we are, and will continue to be, significantly
dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their
respective relationships with account holders and merchants to support our
programs and services. Furthermore, we depend on our issuing partners and
acquirers to continue to innovate to maintain competitiveness in the market.
We do not issue cards or other payment devices, extend credit to account
holders or determine the interest rates or other fees charged to account
holders. Each issuer determines these and most other competitive payment
program features. In addition, we do not establish the discount rate that
merchants are charged for acceptance, which is the responsibility of our
acquiring customers. As a result, our business significantly depends on the
continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers
and the strength of our relationships with them. In turn, our customers'
success depends on a variety of factors over which we have little or no
influence, including economic conditions in global financial markets or their
disintermediation by competitors or emerging technologies, as well as
regulation. If our customers become financially unstable, we may lose revenue
or we may be exposed to settlement risk. See our risk factor in "Risk Factors
- Settlement and Third-Party Obligations" in this Part I, Item 1A with respect
to how we guarantee certain third-party obligations for further discussion.

With the exception of the United States and a select number of other
jurisdictions, most in-country (as opposed to cross-border) transactions
conducted using Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus cards are authorized, cleared
and settled by our customers or other processors. Because we do not provide
domestic switching services in these countries and do not, as described above,
have direct relationships with account holders, we depend on our close working
relationships with our customers to effectively manage our brands, and the
perception of our payments system, among consumers in these countries. We also
rely on these customers to help manage our brands and perception among
regulators and merchants in these countries, alongside our own relationships
with them. From time to time, our customers may take actions that we do not
believe to be in the best interests of our payments system overall, which may
materially and adversely impact our business.

Merchants' continued focus on acceptance costs may lead to additional
litigation and regulatory proceedings and increase our incentive program
costs, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability.

Merchants are important constituents in our payments system. We rely on both
our relationships with them, as well as their relationships with our issuer
and acquirer customers, to continue to expand the acceptance of our integrated
products and services. We also work with merchants to help them enable new
sales channels, create better purchase experiences, improve efficiencies,
increase revenues and fight fraud. In the retail industry, there is a set of
larger merchants with increasingly global scope and influence that we believe
are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments
industry, including Mastercard. Some large merchants have supported the legal,
regulatory and legislative challenges to interchange fees that Mastercard has
been defending, including the U.S. merchant litigations. Some merchants are
increasingly asking regulators to review and potentially regulate our own
network fees, in addition to interchange. See our risk factor in "Risk Factors
- Other Regulation" in this Part I, Item 1A with respect to payments industry
regulation, including interchange fees. The continued focus of merchants on
the costs of accepting various forms of payment, including in connection with
the growth of digital payments, may lead to additional litigation and
regulatory proceedings.

Certain larger merchants are also able to negotiate incentives from us and
pricing concessions from our issuer and acquirer customers as a condition to
accepting our products. We also make payments to certain merchants to
incentivize them to create co-branded payment programs with us. As merchants
consolidate and become even larger, we may have to increase the amount of
incentives that we provide to certain merchants, which could materially and
adversely affect our results of operations. Competitive and regulatory
pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these
incentives. Additionally, if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows our
business could suffer.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Our work with governments exposes us to unique risks that could have a
material impact on our business and results of operations.

As we increase our work with national, state and local governments, both
indirectly through financial institutions and with them directly as our
customers, we may face various risks inherent in associating or contracting
directly with governments. These risks include, but are not limited to, the
following:

•Governmental entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies.
Changes in governmental priorities or other political developments, including
disruptions in governmental operations, could impact approved funding and
result in changes in the scope, or lead to the termination, of the
arrangements or contracts we or financial institutions enter into with respect
to our payment products and services.

•Our work with governments subjects us to U.S. and international anti-
corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K.
Bribery Act. A violation and subsequent judgment or settlement under these
laws could subject us to substantial monetary penalties and damages and have a
significant reputational impact.

•Working or contracting with governments, either directly or via our financial
institution customers, can subject us to heightened reputational risks,
including extensive scrutiny and publicity, as well as a potential association
with the policies of a government as a result of a business arrangement with
that government. Any negative publicity or negative association with a
government entity, regardless of its accuracy, may adversely affect our
reputation.

Global Economic and Political Environment

Global economic, political, financial and societal events or conditions could
result in a material and adverse impact on our overall business and results of
operations.

Adverse economic trends. Adverse economic trends in key countries in which we
operate may adversely affect our financial performance. Such impact may
include, but is not limited to, the following:

•Customers mitigating their economic exposure by limiting the issuance of new
Mastercard products and requesting greater incentive or greater cost stability
from us

•Consumers and businesses lowering spending, which could impact domestic and
cross-border spend

•Government intervention (including the effect of laws, regulations and/or
government investments on or in our financial institution customers), as well
as uncertainty due to changing political regimes in executive, legislative
and/or judicial branches of government, that may have potential negative
effects on our business and our relationships with customers or otherwise
alter their strategic direction away from our products

•Tightening of credit availability that could impact the ability of
participating financial institutions to lend to us under the terms of our
credit facility

Cross-border transactions. We switch substantially all cross-border
transactions using Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards and generate a
significant amount of revenue from cross-border volume fees and fees related
to switched transactions. Revenue from switching cross-border and currency
conversion transactions for our customers fluctuates with the levels and
destinations of cross-border travel and our customers' need for transactions
to be converted into their base currency. Cross-border activity has, and may
continue to be, adversely affected by world geopolitical, economic, health,
weather and other conditions. These include COVID-19, as well as the threat of
terrorism and separate outbreaks of flu, viruses and other diseases (any of
which could result in future epidemics or pandemics), as well as major
environmental and extreme weather events, including those related to climate
change. The impact of and uncertainty that could result from any of these
events or factors could ultimately decrease cross-border activity.
Additionally, any regulation of interregional interchange fees could also
negatively impact our cross-border activity (for example, the targets
announced by the G20 Financial Stability Board related to cross-border
payments). In each case, decreased cross-border activity could decrease the
revenue we receive.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine,
the United States, the European Union and other governments imposed sanctions
and other restrictive measures on certain Russian-related entities and
individuals and we suspended our business operations in Russia. We have
experienced loss of revenue in this fast-growing market as a result of both
the implementation of sanctions and the suspension of our business operations,
as well as related impacts in Ukraine and throughout the region. Future
developments (including the expansion or extension of the war, future
sanctions and/or actions taken by others globally, and other macroeconomic
factors) could result in further negative impacts on our business and
financial results. As customers, merchants and other business partners are
impacted by the invasion, it can further negatively affect the environment in
which we operate. Moreover, our compliance with sanctions and our decision to
suspend business operations has led, and could further lead, to other legal
ramifications and operational challenges, including fines, the nationalization
of our subsidiary and any resulting impacts, and/or lawsuits.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Standards. Our operations as a global payments network rely in part on global
interoperable standards to help facilitate safe and simple payments. To the
extent geopolitical events result in jurisdictions no longer participating in
the creation or adoption of these standards, or the creation of competing
standards, the products and services we offer could be negatively impacted.

Any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our overall
business and results of operations.

The global COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response have adversely
impacted our business, results of operations and financial condition, and may
continue to do so depending on future developments, which are uncertain.

While conditions related to the global COVID-19 pandemic generally improved in
2022, the pandemic continues to have negative effects on the global economy
and has affected business activity, in particular, in areas such as travel and
supply chains. These impacts have continued to adversely impact consumers, our
customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as our workforce.
Governments, businesses and consumers continue to react to changing
conditions, including the emergence of variants of the virus, the severity of
infections on a regional basis and the global administration of vaccines and
boosters. Such reactions have included tightening or loosening safety measures
and border restrictions or voluntarily making personal safety decisions, as
applicable, based on the current environment of their location.

The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business, results of
operations and financial condition. There are no comparable recent events
which may provide guidance as to the future effects of a global pandemic such
as COVID-19, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of this pandemic or a
similar health epidemic in the future is uncertain and subject to change. The
full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, and measures taken in response,
further impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition
will depend on future developments, which are uncertain, including, but not
limited to, the duration of the pandemic and its impact on the global economy,
including the extent to which we can continue to progress toward and maintain
more consistent economic and operating conditions. Even after the COVID-19
pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse
impacts to our business and our results of operations as a result of its
global economic impact, including any recession that has occurred or may occur
in the future.

Adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could negatively
impact our results of operations.

During 2022, approximately 67% of our revenue was generated from activities
outside the United States. This revenue (and the related expense) could be
transacted in a non-functional currency or valued based on a currency other
than the functional currency of the entity generating the revenues. Resulting
exchange gains and losses are included in our net income. Our risk management
activities provide protection with respect to adverse changes in the value of
only a limited number of currencies and are based on estimates of exposures to
these currencies.

In addition, some of the revenue we generate outside the United States is
subject to unpredictable currency fluctuations including devaluation of
currencies where the values of other currencies change relative to the U.S.
dollar. If the U.S. dollar strengthens compared to currencies in which we
generate revenue, this revenue may be translated at a materially lower amount
than expected. Furthermore, we may become subject to exchange control
regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our other
revenue currencies into U.S. dollars, such as what we have experienced in
Venezuela.

The occurrence of currency fluctuations or exchange controls could have a
material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Brand, Reputational Impact and ESG

Negative brand perception may materially and adversely affect our overall
business.

Our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business. The ability to
attract consumers to our branded products and retain them depends upon the
external perception of us and our industry:

•Our business may be affected by actions taken by our customers, merchants or
other organizations that impact the perception of our brands or the payments
industry in general. From time to time, our customers may take actions that we
do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands, such as creditor
practices that may be viewed as "predatory". Moreover, adverse developments
with respect to our industry or the industries of our customers or other
companies and organizations that use our products and services (including
certain legally permissible but high- risk merchant categories, such as adult
content, firearms, alcohol and tobacco) may also, by association, impair our
reputation, or result in greater public, regulatory or legislative scrutiny,
as well as potential litigation. We may also face similar scrutiny to the
extent that we are unable to detect and/or prevent illegal activities using
our payment products or otherwise occurring over our network.

•We have been pursuing the use of social media channels at an increasingly
rapid pace. Under some circumstances, our use of social media, or the use of
social media by others as a channel for criticism or other purposes, could
also cause rapid, widespread reputational harm to our brands by disseminating
rapidly and globally actual or perceived damaging information about us, our
products or merchants or other end users who utilize our products.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

•We are headquartered in the United States. As such, a negative perception of
the United States could impact the perception of our company, which could
adversely affect our business.

Any of the above issues could have a material and adverse effect on our
overall business.

Lack of visibility of our brand in our products and services, or in the
products and services of our partners who use our technology, may materially
and adversely affect our business.

As more players enter the global payments ecosystem, the layers between our
brand and consumers and merchants increase. In order to compete with other
powerful consumer brands that are also becoming part of the consumer payment
experience, we often partner with those brands on payment solutions. These
brands include large digital companies and other technology companies who are
our customers and use our networks to build their own acceptance brands. In
some cases, our brand may not be featured in the payment solution or may be
secondary to other brands. Additionally, as part of our relationships with
some issuers, our payment brand is only included on the back of the card. As a
result, our brand may either be invisible to consumers or may not be the
primary brand with which consumers associate the payment experience. This
brand invisibility, or any consumer confusion as to our role in the consumer
payment experience, could decrease the value of our brand, which could
adversely affect our business.

ESG matters and related stakeholder reaction may impact our reputation, expose
us to legal requirements and liability and/or have other business impacts,
which could adversely affect our overall business and/or results of
operations.

Our brand and reputation are associated with our public commitments to various
ESG initiatives, including our goals relating to climate (e.g., our commitment
to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040), financial inclusion, and diversity,
equity and inclusion. Consumers, investors, employees and other stakeholders
are increasingly focused on ESG practices, and to the extent any of our ESG
disclosures, public statements and metrics are subsequently viewed as
inaccurate, or we are unable to execute on our sustainability initiatives, we
may be viewed negatively by stakeholders concerned about these matters. These
stakeholders may also have a negative view of us to the extent we have been or
in the future are perceived to have not responded appropriately to growing
concerns with respect to ESG matters or take or do not take positions that are
unpopular with them.

In addition, various jurisdictions are increasingly adopting or considering
laws and regulations that have or would impact us pertaining to ESG
governance, strategy, risk management and metrics/targets. Regulations already
adopted or being considered include required corporate reporting and
disclosures on specific topics (such as climate and human rights) as well as
broader matters (such as other environmental matters, treatment of employees
and diversity of workforce). These requirements would likely result in
increased compliance costs for our business and supply chain, which may
increase our operating costs.

Moreover, as governments, investors and other stakeholders face pressure to
address climate change and other ESG matters, these stakeholders may express
new expectations and focus investments in ways that could cause significant
shifts in commerce and consumption behaviors. The impact of and uncertainty
that could result from such shifts could ultimately impact our business.

Any of the above issues could have a material or adverse impact to our overall
business and/or results of operations.

Talent and Culture

We may not be able to attract and retain a highly qualified and diverse
workforce, or maintain our corporate culture, which could harm our overall
business and results of operations.

Our performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of our employees
(including our people leaders), as well as the environment we create for them
to enable them to perform their jobs effectively. The market for specialized
skill-sets is highly competitive, particularly in technology and other areas
that are important to the growth of our business. Our inability to meet
candidate demands has led in recent years, and may continue to lead, to an
increase in declined offers. In addition, high inflation has impacted both
cost structure and employee demand for wage growth, which may lead to talent
attrition. Moreover, changes in and enforcement of immigration and work permit
laws and visa regulations have made it difficult for employees to work in, or
transfer among, jurisdictions where we operate, potentially impairing our
ability to attract and retain talent.

In the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the influence of work
flexibility on candidate decisions, we have adapted our policies and practices
to allow for flexible team-driven work arrangements (including both remote and
hybrid). This approach may impact the nature of relationships among our
workforce, which in turn could have a negative impact on the quality of our
corporate culture and our ability to innovate. To the extent the arrangements
we provide do not meet candidate or employee expectations for flexibility,
this could also impact our ability to attract and retain talent.

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and
diverse employee talent could leave us vulnerable to not anticipating or
identifying emerging customer or market opportunities. We also rely on our
people leaders to display integrity and decency. To the extent our leaders
behave in a manner that is not consistent with our values, we could experience
significant impact to our brand and reputation, as well as to our corporate
culture.

Any one or more of the above could harm our overall business and results of
operations.

Acquisitions

Our efforts to enter into acquisitions, strategic investments or entry into
new businesses could be impacted or prevented by regulatory scrutiny and could
otherwise result in issues that could disrupt our business and harm our
results of operations or reputation.

We continue to evaluate our strategic acquisitions of complementary
businesses, products or technologies, as well as acquiring interests in
related joint ventures or other entities. As we do so, we face increasing
regulatory scrutiny with respect to antitrust, national security and other
considerations that could impact these efforts. We also face competition for
acquisition targets due to the nature of the market for technology companies.
As a result, we could be prevented from successfully completing such
acquisitions in the future. If we are not successful in these efforts, we
could lose strategic opportunities that are dependent, in part, on inorganic
growth.

To the extent we do make these acquisitions, we may not be able to
successfully partner with or integrate them, despite original intentions and
focused efforts. In addition, such an integration may divert management's time
and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations. Moreover, we
may spend time and money on acquisitions or projects that do not meet our
expectations or increase our revenue. To the extent we pay the purchase price
of any acquisition in cash, it would reduce our cash reserves available to us
for other uses, and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock,
it could be dilutive to our stockholders. Furthermore, we may inherit
litigation risk which may increase our post-acquisition costs of operations
and impact our ability to successfully finance that business.

Any acquisition or entry into a new business could subject us to new
regulations, both directly as a result of the new business as well as in the
other existing parts of our business, with which we would need to comply. This
compliance could increase our costs, and we could be subject to liability or
reputational harm to the extent we cannot meet any such compliance
requirements. Additionally, targets that we acquire may have data practices
that do not initially conform to our privacy and data protection standards and
data governance model, which could lead to regulatory scrutiny and
reputational harm.

Settlement and Third-Party Obligations

Our role as guarantor, as well as other contractual obligations, expose us to
risk of loss or illiquidity.

We are a guarantor of certain third-party obligations, including those of
certain of our customers. In this capacity, we are exposed to credit and
liquidity risk from these customers and certain service providers. We may
incur significant losses in connection with transaction settlements if a
customer fails to fund its daily settlement obligations due to technical
problems, liquidity shortfalls, insolvency or other reasons. Concurrent
settlement failures of more than one of our larger customers or of several of
our smaller customers either on a given day or over a condensed period of time
may exceed our available resources and could materially and adversely affect
our results of operations.

We have significant contractual indemnification obligations with certain
customers. Should an event occur that triggers these obligations, such an
event could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results
of operations.

Class A Common Stock and Governance Structure

Provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law could be
considered anti-takeover provisions and have an impact on change-in-control.

Provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
and bylaws and Delaware law could be considered anti-takeover provisions,
including provisions that could delay or prevent entirely a merger or
acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable. These provisions may
also discourage acquisition proposals or have the effect of delaying or
preventing entirely a change in control, which could harm our stock price. For
example, subject to limited exceptions, our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation prohibits any person from beneficially owning more than 15%
of any of the Class A common stock or any other class or series of our stock
with general voting power, or more than 15% of our total voting power. In
addition:

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

•our stockholders are not entitled to the right to cumulate votes in the
election of directors

•our stockholders are not entitled to act by written consent

•any representative of a competitor of Mastercard or of Mastercard Foundation
is disqualified from service on our board of directors

Mastercard Foundation's substantial stock ownership, and restrictions on its
sales, may impact corporate actions or acquisition proposals favorable to, or
favored by, the other public stockholders.

As of February 8, 2023, Mastercard Foundation owned 101,253,283 shares of
Class A common stock, representing approximately 10.7% of our general voting
power. Currently, Mastercard Foundation may not sell or otherwise transfer its
shares of Class A common stock prior to May 1, 2027, except to the extent
necessary to satisfy its charitable disbursement requirements, for which
purpose earlier sales are permitted and have occurred. Based on that timing,
Mastercard Foundation would be permitted to sell all of its remaining shares
beginning May 1, 2027, subject to certain conditions. The directors of
Mastercard Foundation are required to be independent of us and our customers.
The ownership of Class A common stock by Mastercard Foundation, together with
the restrictions on transfer, could discourage or make more difficult
acquisition proposals favored by the other holders of the Class A common
stock. In addition, because Mastercard Foundation is restricted from selling
its shares for an extended period of time, it may not have the same interest
in short or medium-term movements in our stock price as, or incentive to
approve a corporate action that may be favorable to, our other stockholders.

Item 1B. Unresolved staff comments

Not applicable.

Item 2. Properties

We own our corporate headquarters, located in Purchase, New York, and our
principal technology and operations center, located in O'Fallon, Missouri. As

world, consisting of corporate and regional offices, as well as our operations
centers.

We believe that our facilities are suitable and adequate for the business that
we currently conduct. However, we periodically review our space requirements
and may acquire or lease new space to meet the needs of our business and
address climate-related impacts, or consolidate and dispose of facilities that
are no longer required.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND
ISSUES PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Item 5. Market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and
issuer purchases of equity securities

Our Class A common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the
symbol "MA". At February 8, 2023, we had 71 stockholders of record for our
Class A common stock. We believe that the number of beneficial owners is
substantially greater than the number of record holders because a large
portion of our Class A common stock is held in "street name" by brokers.

There is currently no established public trading market for our Class B common
stock. There were approximately 233 holders of record of our non-voting Class
B common stock as of February 8, 2023, constituting approximately 0.8% of our
total outstanding equity.

Stock Performance Graph

The graph and table below compare the cumulative total stockholder return of
Mastercard's Class A common stock, the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 Financials for
the five-year period ended December 31, 2022. The graph assumes a $100
investment in our Class A common stock and both of the indices and the
reinvestment of dividends. Mastercard's Class B common stock is not publicly
traded or listed on any exchange or dealer quotation system.

Dividend Declaration and Policy

On December 6, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend
of $0.57 per share paid on February 9, 2023 to holders of record on January 9,
2023 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. On February 14,
2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.57 per
share payable on May 9, 2023 to holders of record on April 7, 2023 of our
Class A common stock and Class B common stock.

Subject to legally available funds, we intend to continue to pay a quarterly
cash dividend on our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common
stock. However, the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole
discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various
factors, including our financial condition, operating results, available cash
and current and anticipated cash needs.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

During the fourth quarter of 2022, we repurchased 7.4 million shares for $2.4
billion at an average price of $328.26 per share of Class A common stock. See
Note 16 (Stockholders' Equity) to the consolidated financial statements
included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion with respect to our share
repurchase programs. The following table presents our repurchase activity on a

Item 7. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and
results of operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and notes of Mastercard Incorporated and its consolidated
subsidiaries, including Mastercard International Incorporated ("Mastercard
International") (together, "Mastercard" or the "Company"), included elsewhere
in this Report. Percentage changes provided throughout "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" were
calculated on amounts rounded to the nearest thousand. For discussion related
to the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to
the year ended December 31, 2020, please see Part II, Item 7 of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. During 2022, the
Company updated its disaggregated net revenue presentation by category and
geography to reflect the nature of its payment services and to align such
information with the way in which management will prospectively view its
categories of net revenue. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the 2022 presentation. The reclassification had no impact on
previously reported total net revenue, operating income or net income.

Business Overview

Mastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry. We connect
consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners,
businesses and other organizations worldwide by enabling electronic payments
instead of cash and checks and making those payment transactions safe, simple,
smart, and accessible. We make payments easier and more efficient by providing
a wide range of payment solutions and services using our family of well-known
and trusted brands, including Mastercard®, Maestro® and Cirrus®. We operate a
multi-rail payments network that provides choice and flexibility for
consumers, merchants and our customers. Through our unique and proprietary
core global payments network, we switch (authorize, clear and settle) payment
transactions. We have additional payment capabilities that include automated
clearing house ("ACH") transactions (both batch and real-time account-based
payments). Using these capabilities, we offer integrated payment products and
services and capture new payment flows. Our value-added services include,
among others, cyber and intelligence solutions to allow all parties to
transact easily and with confidence, as well as other services that provide
proprietary insights, drawing on our principled use of secure consumer and
merchant data. Our investments in new networks, such as open banking solutions
and digital identity capabilities, support and strengthen our payments and
services solutions. Our franchise model sets the standards and ground-rules
for our core global payments network that balance value and risk across all
stakeholders and allows for interoperability among them. Our payment solutions
are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments ecosystem.

Mastercard is not a financial institution. We do not issue cards, extend
credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged
to account holders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in
connection with merchants' acceptance of our products. In most cases, account
holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, our customers.

Russia and Ukraine

Beginning in February 2022, in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine,
the United States, the European Union and other governments imposed sanctions
and other restrictive measures on certain Russian-related entities and
individuals and, in March 2022, we suspended our business operations in
Russia1. We have taken steps necessary to ensure compliance with all
applicable regulatory restrictions with sanctioned entities and individuals
and have suspended our business operations with non-sanctioned customers in
Russia. Throughout this process, our priority has been the safety and well-
being of our employees and their families.

These actions have impacted our full year 2022 performance. As a point of
reference, for the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 4% of our net
revenues were derived from business conducted within, into and out of Russia.
Additional financial implications directly related to these actions include,
but are not limited to, incremental employee-related costs, reserves on
uncollectible balances with certain customers and impacts to net revenue,
primarily related to rebates and incentives as a result of revised estimates
of customer performance through the date of the suspension of our business
operations.

We continue to monitor the effects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the
related impacts to regional and global economies. The full extent to which
this matter affects our business, results of operations and financial
condition will depend on future developments, including the duration of the
invasion and the impacts on regional and global economies, which are
uncertain, and cannot be predicted at this time.

1 As a result of the suspension of our business operations, which included the
suspension of our network services, cards issued by Russian banks are no
longer supported by the Mastercard network regardless of where the cards are
used, inside or outside of Russia. In addition, any Mastercard issued outside
of Russia will not work at merchants or ATMs located in Russia.

solutions, which increased 26% and 18%, on a currency-neutral basis,
respectively.

The adjusted effective income tax rate of 15.7% was higher than prior year due
to the recognition of U.S. tax benefits in 2021 (the majority of which were
discrete), a discrete tax benefit in 2021 related to the remeasurement of our
net deferred tax asset in the U.K. and a discrete tax expense related to an
unfavorable court ruling in 2022, all of which were partially offset by a
discrete tax benefit in the first quarter of 2022 due to final U.S. tax
regulations published in the current year.

Other 2022 financial highlights were as follows:

•We generated net cash flows from operations of $11.2 billion.

•We completed the acquisition of a business for total consideration of $0.3
billion.

•We repurchased 25.7 million shares of our common stock for $8.8 billion and
paid dividends of $1.9 billion.

•We completed a euro-denominated debt offering for an aggregate principal
amount of $0.8 billion and entered into an Indian rupee-denominated term loan
for $0.3 billion.

Non-GAAP Financial Information

Non-GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a
company's performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different
than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). Our
non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of gains and losses on our
equity investments which includes mark-to-market fair value adjustments,
impairments and gains and losses upon disposition and the related tax impacts.
Our non-GAAP financial measures also exclude the impact of special items,
where applicable, which represent litigation judgments and settlements and
certain one-time items, as well as the related tax impacts ("Special Items").
Our non-GAAP financial measures for the comparable periods exclude the impact
of the following:

Gains and Losses on Equity Investments

•During 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded net losses of $145 million ($126
million after tax, or $0.13 per diluted share), net gains of $645 million
($497 million after tax, or $0.50 per diluted share) and net gains of $30
million ($15 million after tax, or $0.01 per diluted share), respectively.
These net gains and losses were primarily related to unrealized fair market
value adjustments on marketable and nonmarketable equity securities. In
addition, in 2021, net gains also included realized gains on sales of
marketable equity securities.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Special Items

Litigation provisions

•During 2022, we recorded pre-tax charges of $356 million ($263 million after
tax, or $0.27 per diluted share) related to litigation provisions which
included pre-tax charges of:

◦$223 million as a result of settlements (both final and agreements in
principle) with a number of U.K. merchants, and

◦$133 million as a result of a change in estimate related to the claims of
merchants who opted out of the U.S. merchant class litigation.

•During 2021, we recorded pre-tax charges of $94 million ($74 million after
tax, or $0.07 per diluted share) related to litigation settlements and
estimated attorneys' fees with U.K. and Pan-European merchants.

•During 2020, we recorded pre-tax charges of $73 million ($67 million after
tax, or $0.07 per diluted share) related to litigation provisions which
included pre-tax charges of:

◦$45 million related to a legal matter associated with our prepaid cards in
the U.K., and

◦$28 million related to estimated attorneys' fees and litigation settlements
with U.K. and Pan-European merchants.

Russia-related impacts

•During 2022, we recorded a net charge of $30 million ($24 million after tax,
or $0.02 per diluted share), directly related to imposed sanctions and the
suspension of our business operations in Russia. The net charge is comprised
of general and administrative expenses of $67 million, primarily related to
incremental employee-related costs and reserves on uncollectible balances with
certain sanctioned customers. These charges are offset by net benefits of $37
million in net revenue, primarily related to a reduction in rebates and
incentives liabilities as a result of lower estimates of customer performance
for certain customer business agreements due to the suspension of our business
operations in Russia.

Indirect tax matter

•During 2021, we recorded a charge of $88 million ($69 million after tax, or
$0.07 per diluted share) to resolve a foreign indirect tax matter for 2015
through 2021 and the related interest expense. The charge is comprised of
general and administrative expenses of $82 million and other income (expense)
of $6 million.

See Note 7 (Investments) and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the
consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 and "Key
Developments" above for further discussion related to certain of our non-GAAP
financial measures. We excluded these items because management evaluates the
underlying operations and performance of the Company separately from these
recurring and nonrecurring items.

We believe that the non-GAAP financial measures presented facilitate an
understanding of our operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison
of our results between periods. We use non-GAAP financial measures to, among
other things, evaluate our ongoing operations in relation to historical
results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation
of performance-based compensation.

Currency-neutral Growth Rates

We present growth rates adjusted for the impact of currency, which is a non-
GAAP financial measure. Currency-neutral growth rates are calculated by
remeasuring the prior period's results using the current period's exchange
rates for both the translational and transactional impacts on operating
results. The impact of currency translation represents the effect of
translating operating results where the functional currency is different than
our U.S. dollar reporting currency. The impact of the transactional currency
represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a
currency other than the functional currency of the entity. The impact of the
related realized gains and losses resulting from our foreign exchange
derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments is recognized
in the respective financial statement line item on the statement of operations
when the underlying forecasted transactions impact earnings. We believe the
presentation of currency-neutral growth rates provides relevant information to
facilitate an understanding of our operating results.

The translational and transactional impact of currency and the related impact
of our foreign exchange derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging
instruments ("Currency impact") has been excluded from our currency-neutral
growth rates and has been identified in our "Drivers of Change" tables. See
"Foreign Currency - Currency Impact" for further information on our currency
impacts and "Financial Results - Revenue and Operating Expenses" for our
"Drivers of Change" tables.

Net revenue, operating expenses, operating margin, other income (expense),
effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share adjusted
for the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments, Special Items
and/or the impact of

Key Metrics

In addition to the financial measures described above in "Financial Results
Overview", we review the following metrics to evaluate and identify trends in
our business, measure our performance, prepare financial projections and make
strategic decisions. We believe that the key metrics presented facilitate an
understanding of our operating and financial performance and provide a
meaningful comparison of our results between periods.

Operating Margin measures how much profit we make on each dollar of sales
after our operating costs but before other income (expense) and income tax
expense. Operating margin is calculated by dividing our operating income by
net revenue.

Key Drivers

Gross Dollar Volume ("GDV")1 measures dollar volume of activity, including
both domestic and cross-border volume, on cards carrying our brands during the
period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis. GDV
represents purchase volume plus cash volume; "purchase volume" means the
aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with Mastercard-branded cards for
the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of
cash disbursements and includes the impact of balance transfers and
convenience checks obtained with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant
period. Information denominated in U.S. dollars relating to GDV is calculated
by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each
local currency in which our volumes are reported. These exchange rates are
calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each
quarter. We report period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and
cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate
the impact of changes in the value of currencies against the U.S. dollar in
calculating such rates of change.

PART II

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Cross-border Volume Growth2 measures the growth of cross-border dollar volume
during the period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis,
for all Mastercard-branded programs.

Switched Transactions2 measures the number of transactions switched by
Mastercard, which is defined as the number of transactions initiated and
switched through our network during the period.

1 Data used in the calculation of GDV is provided by Mastercard customers and
is subject to verification by Mastercard and partial cross-checking against
information provided by Mastercard's transaction switching systems. All data
is subject to revision and amendment by Mastercard or Mastercard's customers.
Starting in the first quarter of 2022, data related to sanctioned Russian
banks was not reported to us and therefore such amounts are not included.
Subsequent to the suspension of our business operations in Russia in March
2022, there is no Russian data to be reported.

2 Growth rates are normalized to eliminate the effects of differing switching
and carryover days between periods. Carryover days are those where
transactions and volumes from days where the Company does not clear and settle
are processed. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we began clearing and settling
transactions and volumes on a daily basis.

The following tables provide a summary of the growth trends in our key
drivers.

Key Metrics related to the Payment Network

Assessments represent agreed upon standard pricing provided to our customers
based on various forms of payment-related activity. Assessments are used
internally by management to monitor operating performance as it allows for
comparability and provides visibility into cardholder trends. Assessments do
not represent our net revenue.

The following provides additional information on our key metrics related to
the payment network:

•Domestic assessments are charges based on activity related to cards that
carry the Company's brands where the merchant country and the country of
issuance are the same. These assessments are primarily driven by the domestic
dollar volume of activity (e.g., domestic purchase volume, domestic cash
volume) or the number of cards issued.

•Cross-border assessments are charges based on activity related to cards that
carry the Company's brands where the merchant country and the country of
issuance are different. These assessments are primarily driven by the cross-
border dollar volume of activity (e.g., cross-border purchase volume, cross-
border cash volume).

PART II

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

•Transaction processing assessments are charges primarily driven by the number
of switched transactions on our payment network. Switching activities include:

◦Authorization, the process by which a transaction is routed to the issuer for
approval

◦Clearing, the determination and exchange of financial transaction information
between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been successfully
conducted at the point of interaction

◦Settlement, which facilitates the determination and exchange of funds between
parties

These assessments can also include connectivity services and network access
which are based on the volume of data transmitted and the number of
authorization and settlement messages.

•Other network assessments are charges for licensing, implementation and other
franchise fees.

Foreign Currency

Currency Impact

Our primary revenue functional currencies are the U.S. dollar, euro, Brazilian
real and the British pound. Our overall operating results are impacted by
currency translation, which represents the effect of translating operating
results where the functional currency is different than our U.S. dollar
reporting currency.

Our operating results are also impacted by transactional currency. The impact
of the transactional currency represents the effect of converting revenue and
expense transactions occurring in a currency other than the functional
currency. Changes in currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation
of gross dollar volume ("GDV") and gross euro volume ("GEV"), which are used
in the calculation of our key metrics related to domestic assessments and
cross-border assessments as well as certain volume-related rebates and
incentives. In most non-European regions, GDV is calculated based on local
currency spending volume converted to U.S. dollars using average exchange
rates for the period. In Europe, GEV is calculated based on local currency
spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the
period. As a result, our key metrics related to domestic assessments and
cross-border assessments as well as certain volume-related rebates and
incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar
versus non-European local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the
euro versus other European local currencies. For example, our billing in
Australia is in the U.S. dollar, however, consumer spend in Australia is in
the Australian dollar. The currency transactional impact of converting
Australian dollars to our U.S. dollar billing currency will have an impact on
the revenue generated. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar is
evident when GDV growth on a U.S. dollar-converted basis is compared to GDV
growth on a local currency basis. In 2022, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted
basis increased 5.9%, while GDV on a local currency basis increased 12.3%
versus 2021. In 2021, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis increased 22.0%,
while GDV on a local currency basis increased 20.6% versus 2020. Further, the
impact from transactional currency occurs in transaction processing revenue,
other revenue and operating expenses when the local currency of these items is
different than the functional currency of the entity.

Through December 31, 2020, our approach to managing transactional currency
exposure consisted of hedging a portion of anticipated revenues impacted by
transactional currencies by entering into foreign exchange derivative
contracts, and recording the related changes in fair value in general and
administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. During
the first quarter of 2021, we started to formally designate certain newly-
executed foreign exchange derivative contracts, which meet the established
accounting criteria, as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses resulting from
changes in fair value of these designated

PART II

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

contracts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and
subsequently recognized in the respective component of net revenue when the
underlying forecasted transactions impact earnings.

Foreign Exchange Activity

We incur foreign currency gains and losses from remeasuring monetary assets
and liabilities, including settlement assets and obligations, that are
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. To
manage this foreign exchange risk, we may enter into foreign exchange
derivative contracts to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure of a
portion of our nonfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities. The
gains or losses resulting from the changes in fair value of these contracts
are intended to reduce the potential effect of the underlying hedged exposure
and are recorded net within general and administrative expenses on the
consolidated statement of operations. The impact of this foreign exchange
activity, including the related hedging activities, has not been eliminated in

Our foreign exchange risk management activities are discussed further in Note
23 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) to the consolidated financial
statements included in Part II, Item 8.

Risk of Currency Devaluation

We are exposed to currency devaluation in certain countries. In addition, we
are subject to exchange control regulations that restrict the conversion of
financial assets into U.S. dollars. While these revenues and assets are not
material to us on a consolidated basis, we can be negatively impacted should
there be a continued and sustained devaluation of local currencies relative to
the U.S. dollar and/or a continued and sustained deterioration of economic
conditions in these countries.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, net revenue increased 18% versus the
comparable period in 2021. Adjusted net revenue increased 18%, or 23% on a
currency-neutral basis. The increase in net revenue was attributable to both
our payment network and our value-added services and solutions and included 1
percentage point of growth from acquisitions. Net revenue includes $13,084
million of rebates and incentives provided to our customers, an increase of
19%, or 23% on a currency-neutral basis, in 2022 versus 2021.

Net revenue from our payment network increased 20%, or 26% on a currency-
neutral basis, in 2022 versus 2021. The increase was primarily driven by
growth in domestic and cross-border dollar volumes and an increase in the
number of switched transactions, reflecting trends of growth in our key
drivers. Net revenue from our payment network includes $12,445 million of
rebates and incentives provided to customers, which increased 19%, or 23% on a
currency-neutral basis, in 2022 versus 2021, primarily due to an increase in
our key drivers as well as new and renewed deals.

Net revenue from our value-added services and solutions increased 14%, or 18%
on a currency-neutral basis, in 2022 versus 2021, which includes a 4
percentage point increase from acquisitions. The remaining increase was
primarily driven by our cyber and intelligence and data and services
solutions.

No individual country, other than the United States, generated more than 10%
of net revenue in any such period. A significant portion of our net revenue is
concentrated among our five largest customers. In 2022, the net revenue from
these customers was approximately $4.7 billion, or 21%, of total net revenue.
The loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could
adversely impact our revenue.

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses increased 13% in 2022 versus the prior year. Adjusted
operating expenses increased 11%, or 14% on a currency-neutral basis, versus
the prior year, which includes a 4 percentage point increase from
acquisitions. The remaining increase was primarily due to higher personnel
costs, travel and meeting costs and unfavorable foreign exchange activity.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses increased 14%, or 17% on a currency-
neutral basis, in 2022 versus the prior year. Current year results include
growth of 4 percentage points from acquisitions. The remaining increase was
primarily due to higher personnel costs to support our continued investment in
our strategic initiatives across payments, services and new networks,
increased travel and meeting costs and balance sheet remeasurement losses due
to unfavorable foreign exchange activity.

marketing campaigns.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased 3%, or 7% on a currency-
neutral basis, in 2022 versus the prior year, due to the amortization of
acquired intangible assets from acquisitions.

Provision for Litigation

In 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded $356 million, $94 million and $73 million,
respectively, related to various legal proceedings. See "Non-GAAP Financial
Information" in this section and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to
the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further
discussion.

Other Income (Expense)

Other income (expense) was unfavorable $757 million in 2022 versus the prior
year, primarily due to net losses in the current year versus net gains in the
prior year related to unrealized fair market value adjustments on marketable
and nonmarketable equity securities and realized gains on sales of marketable
equity securities in 2021. Adjusted other income (expense) was favorable $26
million versus the prior year, primarily due to an increase in our investment
income, partially offset by increased interest expense related to our 2022
debt issuances.

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
were 15.4% and 15.7%, respectively. The adjusted effective income tax rates
for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 15.7% and 15.4%,
respectively. The effective income tax rate was lower in 2022 primarily due to
a discrete tax benefit in the first quarter of 2022 related to final U.S. tax
regulations published in the current year. These regulations resulted in a
valuation allowance release of $333 million associated with the U.S. foreign
tax credit carryforward deferred tax asset. The regulations limit Mastercard's
ability to generate foreign tax credits starting in 2022 for certain foreign
taxes paid, resulting in additional U.S. tax expense. Additionally, a more
favorable geographic mix of earnings in 2022 contributed to the lower
effective tax rate. The lower effective income tax rate was partially offset
by:

•the recognition of U.S. tax benefits in 2021 (the majority of which were
discrete) resulting from a higher foreign derived intangible income deduction
and greater utilization of foreign tax credits in the U.S.

•a discrete tax benefit in 2021 related to the remeasurement of the our net
deferred tax asset in the U.K. due to an enacted tax rate change in 2021

•a discrete tax expense related to an unfavorable court ruling in 2022

The adjusted effective income tax rate was higher in 2022 primarily due to:

•the recognition of U.S. tax benefits in 2021 (the majority of which were
discrete) resulting from a higher foreign derived intangible income deduction
and greater utilization of foreign tax credits in the U.S.

•a discrete tax benefit in 2021 related to the remeasurement of the our net
deferred tax asset in the U.K. due to an enacted tax rate change in 2021

•a discrete tax expense related to an unfavorable court ruling in 2022

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

All of the above impacts were partially offset by a discrete tax benefit in
the first quarter of 2022 related to final U.S. tax regulations published in
the current year. These regulations resulted in a valuation allowance release
of $333 million associated with the U.S. foreign tax credit carryforward
deferred tax asset. The regulations limit Mastercard's ability to generate
foreign tax credits starting in 2022 for certain foreign taxes paid, resulting
in additional U.S. tax expense.

See Note 20 (Income Taxes) to the consolidated financial statements included
in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion.

In August 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (the "IRA"). The
IRA includes a corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on the adjusted
financial statement income of corporations for years beginning after December
31, 2022, and an excise tax of 1% on the fair market value of annual net stock
repurchases made after December 31, 2022. We continue to analyze the impacts
of the IRA, however, it is not expected to have a material impact on our
financial statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We rely on existing liquidity, cash generated from operations and access to
capital to fund our global operations, credit and settlement exposure, capital
expenditures, investments in our business and current and potential
obligations. The following table summarizes the cash, cash equivalents,
investments and credit available to us at December 31:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | 2022| | 2021

Unused line of credit| | 8.0 | | | 6.0 |  
  
1Investments include available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity
securities. This amount excludes restricted cash and restricted cash
equivalents of $2.2 billion and $2.5 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively.

We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment securities
balances, our cash flow generating capabilities, and our access to capital
resources are sufficient to satisfy our future operating cash needs, capital
asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements
associated with our existing operations and potential obligations which
include litigation provisions and credit and settlement exposure.

Our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global
credit market conditions. We guarantee the settlement of many of the
transactions between our customers. Historically, payments under these
guarantees have not been significant; however, historical trends may not be an
indication of potential future losses. The risk of loss on these guarantees is
specific to individual customers, but may also be driven by regional or global
economic conditions, including, but not limited to the health of the financial
institutions in a country or region. See Note 22 (Settlement and Other Risk
Management) to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 for a
description of these guarantees.

Our liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the
outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party.
For additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business, see
Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors - Legal and Regulatory Risks and Note 21 (Legal
and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included
in Part II, Item 8.

Cash Flow

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.7 billion in 2022
versus the prior year, primarily due to higher net income adjusted for non-
cash items and timing of settlement with customers.

Net cash used in investing activities decreased $3.8 billion in 2022 versus
the prior year, primarily due to lower business acquisition activity in the
current year.

Net cash used in financing activities increased $3.8 billion in 2022 versus
the prior year, primarily due to higher repurchases of our Class A common
stock in the current year.

Debt and Credit Availability

In February 2022, we issued €750 million ($800 million as of December 31,
2022) principal amount of notes due February 2029 (the "2022 EUR Notes"). In
July 2022, we entered into an unsecured INR22.7 billion ($275 million as of
December 31, 2022) term loan due July 2023 (the "INR Term Loan"). During 2022,
€700 million ($724 million as of the maturity date) of principal related to
the 2015 Euro Notes matured and was paid. Our total debt outstanding was $14.0
billion at December 31, 2022, with the earliest maturity of INR22.7 billion
($275 million as of December 31, 2022) of principal occurring in July 2023.

As of December 31, 2022, we have a commercial paper program (the "Commercial
Paper Program"), under which we are authorized to issue up to $6 billion in
outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance.
On January 27, 2023, we increased our Commercial Paper Program from $6 billion
to $8 billion. In conjunction with the Commercial Paper Program, we have a
committed unsecured $8 billion revolving credit facility (the "Credit
Facility") which now expires in November 2027.

Borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility are to
be used to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, including
providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our
customers. In addition, we may borrow and repay amounts under these facilities
for business continuity purposes. We had no borrowings outstanding under the
Commercial Paper Program or the Credit Facility at December 31, 2022.

See Note 15 (Debt) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part
II, Item 8 for further discussion on our debt, the Commercial Paper Program
and the Credit Facility.

Dividends and Share Repurchases

We have historically paid quarterly dividends on our outstanding Class A
common stock and Class B common stock. Subject to legally available funds, we
intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend. The declaration and
payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our Board of
Directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial
condition, operating results, available cash and current and anticipated cash
needs.

The program approved in 2022 will become effective after completion of the
share repurchase program approved in 2021. The timing and actual number of
additional shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including
cash requirements to meet the operating needs of the business, legal
requirements, as well as the share price and economic and market conditions.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The application of GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions about
certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial
condition. Our significant accounting policies, including recent accounting
pronouncements, are described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item
8.

Revenue Recognition - Rebates and Incentives

We enter into business agreements with certain customers that provide for
rebates and incentives when customers meet certain volume thresholds or other
incentives tied to customer performance. We consider various factors in
estimating customer performance, including forecasted transactions, card
issuance and card conversion volumes, expected payments and historical
experience with that customer. Rebates and incentives are recorded within net
revenue based on these estimates primarily when volume- and transaction- based
revenues are recognized over the contractual term. Differences between actual
results and our estimates are adjusted in the period the customer reports
actual performance. If our customers' actual performance is not consistent
with our estimates of their performance, net revenue may be materially
different.

Loss Contingencies

We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. We
regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess its
potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal
proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated,
we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required
in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably
estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or
regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-
house and outside legal counsel. Because of uncertainties related to these
matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the
time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential
liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our
estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory
process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may
be materially different than the actual outcomes.

Income Taxes

In calculating our effective income tax rate, estimates are required regarding
the timing and amount of taxable and deductible items which will adjust the
pretax income earned in various tax jurisdictions. Through our interpretation
of local tax regulations, adjustments to pretax income for income earned in
various tax jurisdictions are reflected within various tax filings. Although
we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable,
actual results may be materially different than the estimated amounts.

We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the
amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Significant judgment is
required in determining the valuation allowance. In assessing the need for a
valuation allowance, we consider all sources of taxable income, including
projected future taxable income, reversing taxable temporary differences and
ongoing tax planning strategies. If it is determined that we are able to
realize deferred tax assets in excess of the net carrying value

PART II

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

or to the extent we are unable to realize a deferred tax asset, we would
adjust the valuation allowance in the period in which such a determination is
made, with a corresponding increase or decrease to earnings.

We record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken, or expected to be
taken, which may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained, upon
examination by the relevant taxing authorities. We consider all relevant facts
and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether any benefit
resulting from an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be
sustained and, if so, how current law impacts the amount reflected within
these financial statements. If upon examination, we realize a tax benefit
which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained, this would
generally increase earnings in the period. In certain situations, we will have
offsetting tax credits or taxes in other jurisdictions.

Deferred taxes are established on the estimated foreign exchange gains or
losses for foreign earnings that are not considered permanently reinvested,
which will be recognized through cumulative translation adjustments as
incurred. Ultimately, the working capital requirements of foreign affiliates
will determine the amount of cash to be remitted from respective
jurisdictions.

Business Combinations

We account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of
accounting. The acquisition purchase price, including contingent
consideration, if any, is allocated to the underlying identified, tangible and
intangible assets, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the
acquiree, based on their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition
date. Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired,
including identifiable intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill. The amounts
and useful lives assigned to acquisition-related tangible and intangible
assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense. We use
various valuation techniques to determine fair value, primarily discounted
cash flows analysis, relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings for
estimating the value of intangible assets. These valuation techniques include
comparable company multiples, discount rates, growth projections and other
assumptions of future business conditions. Determining the fair value of
assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any non-controlling interest in the
acquiree and the expected useful lives, requires management's judgment. The
significance of management's estimates and assumptions is relative to the size
of the acquisition. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be
reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.

Item 7A. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk
sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in factors such as interest
rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our exposure to market risk from
changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates is limited. Management
monitors risk exposures on an ongoing basis and establishes and oversees the
implementation of policies governing our funding, investments and use of
derivative financial instruments to manage these risks.

Foreign currency and interest rate exposures are managed through our risk
management activities, which are discussed further in Note 23 (Derivative and
Hedging Instruments) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part
II, Item 8.

Foreign Exchange Risk

We enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to manage currency
exposure associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements occurring in a
currency other than the functional currency of the entity. We may also enter
into foreign currency derivative contracts to offset possible changes in value
of assets and liabilities due to foreign exchange fluctuations. The objective
of these activities is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses
resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional
currencies, principally the U.S. dollar and euro. The effect of a hypothetical
10% adverse change in the value of the functional currencies could result in a
fair value loss of approximately $94 million and $70 million on our foreign
exchange derivative contracts outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively, before considering the offsetting effect of the underlying
hedged activity.

We are also subject to foreign exchange risk as part of our daily settlement
activities. To manage this risk, we enter into short duration foreign exchange
contracts based upon anticipated receipts and disbursements for the respective
currency position. This risk is typically limited to a few days between when a
payment transaction takes place and the subsequent settlement with our
customers. The effect of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the value of the
functional currencies would not have a material impact to the fair value of
our short duration foreign exchange derivative contracts outstanding at
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

PART II

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are further exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to translation of
our net investment in foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is
different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency. To manage this risk, we may
enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our net
investment in foreign subsidiaries. The effect of a hypothetical 10% adverse
change in the value of the U.S. dollar could result in a fair value loss of
approximately $203 million and $165 million on our foreign exchange derivative
contracts designated as a net investment hedge at December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively, before considering the offsetting effect of the underlying
hedged activity.

Interest Rate Risk

Our available-for-sale debt investments include fixed and variable rate
securities that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Our policy is to
invest in high quality securities, while providing adequate liquidity and
maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure. A hypothetical 100
basis point adverse change in interest rates would not have a material impact
to the fair value of our investments at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

We are also exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate debt. To
manage this risk, we may enter into interest rate derivative contracts to
hedge a portion of our fixed-rate debt that is exposed to changes in fair
value attributable to changes in a benchmark interest rate. The effect of a
hypothetical 100 basis point adverse change in interest rates could result in
a fair value loss of approximately $36 million and $49 million on our interest
rate derivative contracts designated as a fair value hedge of our fixed-rate
debt at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, before considering the
offsetting effect of the underlying hedged activity.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Management's report on internal control over financial reporting

The management of Mastercard Incorporated ("Mastercard") is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. As required by
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management has assessed the
effectiveness of Mastercard's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2022. In making its assessment, management has utilized the
criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
Management has concluded that, based on its assessment, Mastercard's internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. The
effectiveness of Mastercard's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which
appears on the next page.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Mastercard Incorporated

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Mastercard
Incorporated and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022 and
2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive
income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively
referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited
the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial
statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the
Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent
with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the
current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that
(i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated
financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective,
or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not
alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken
as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,
providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts
or disclosures to which it relates.

Revenue Recognition - Rebates and Incentives

As described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company provides certain customers with rebates and incentives which are a
portion of total net revenue of $22.2 billion for the year ended December 31,
2022. The Company has business agreements with certain customers that provide
for rebates and incentives within net revenue that could be either fixed or
variable. Variable rebates and incentives are recorded primarily when volume-
and transaction-based revenues are recognized over the contractual term.
Variable rebates and incentives are calculated based upon estimated customer
performance, such as volume thresholds, and the terms of the related business
agreements. As disclosed by management, various factors are considered in
estimating customer performance, including forecasted transactions, card
issuance and card conversion volumes, expected payments and historical
experience with that customer.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures
relating to rebates and incentives is a critical audit matter are (i) the
significant judgment by management when developing estimates related to
rebates and incentives based on customer performance; and (ii) a high degree
of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and
evaluating management's estimates related to customer performance, including
the reasonableness of the various applicable factors considered by management
in the estimate.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit
evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of
controls relating to rebates and incentives, including controls over
evaluating estimated customer performance. These procedures also included,
among others, evaluating the reasonableness of estimated customer performance
for a sample of customer agreements, including (i) evaluating the agreements
to identify whether all rebates and incentives are identified and recorded
accurately; (ii) testing management's process for developing estimated
customer performance, including evaluating the reasonableness of the various
applicable factors considered by management; and (iii) evaluating estimated
customer performance as compared to actual results in the period the customer
reports actual performance.

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization

Mastercard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including
Mastercard International Incorporated ("Mastercard International" and together
with Mastercard Incorporated, "Mastercard" or the "Company"), is a technology
company in the global payments industry. Mastercard connects consumers,
financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses
and other organizations worldwide by enabling electronic forms of payment
instead of cash and checks and making those payment transactions safe, simple,
smart and accessible. The Company makes payments easier and more efficient by
providing a wide range of payment solutions and services through its family of
well-known and trusted brands, including Mastercard®, Maestro® and Cirrus®.
The Company operates a multi-rail payments network that provides choice and
flexibility for consumers, merchants and Mastercard customers. Through its
unique and proprietary core global payments network, the Company switches
(authorizes, clears and settles) payment transactions. The Company has
additional payment capabilities that include automated clearing house ("ACH")
transactions (both batch and real-time account-based payments). Using these
capabilities, the Company offers integrated payment products and services and
captures new payment flows. The Company's value-added services include, among
others, cyber and intelligence solutions to allow all parties to transact
easily and with confidence, as well as other services that provide proprietary
insights, drawing on Mastercard's principled use of secure consumer and
merchant data. The Company's investments in new networks, such as open banking
solutions and digital identity capabilities, support and strengthen our
payments and services solutions. The Company's franchise model sets the
standards and ground-rules for our core global payments network that balance
value and risk across all stakeholders and allows for interoperability among
them. The Company's payment solutions are designed to ensure safety and
security for the global payments ecosystem.

Mastercard is not a financial institution. The Company does not issue cards,
extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees
charged to account holders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by
acquirers in connection with merchants' acceptance of the Company's products.
In most cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, the
Company's financial institution customers.

Significant Accounting Policies

Consolidation and basis of presentation \- The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Mastercard and its majority-owned and
controlled entities, including any variable interest entities ("VIEs") for
which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Investments in VIEs for which
the Company is not considered the primary beneficiary are not consolidated and
are accounted for as marketable, equity method or measurement alternative
method investments and recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance
sheet. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no significant VIEs which
required consolidation and the investments were not considered material to the
consolidated financial statements. The Company consolidates acquisitions as of
the date on which the Company has obtained a controlling financial interest.
Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
During 2022, the Company updated its disaggregated net revenue presentation by
category and geography to reflect the nature of its payment services and to
align such information with the way in which management will prospectively
view its categories of net revenue. Prior period amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the 2022 presentation. The reclassification had no
impact on previously reported total net revenue, operating income or net
income. The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America ("GAAP").

Non-controlling interests represent the equity interest not owned by the
Company and are recorded for consolidated entities in which the Company owns
less than 100% of the interests. Changes in a parent's ownership interest
while the parent retains its controlling interest are accounted for as equity
transactions, and upon loss of control, retained ownership interests are
remeasured at fair value, with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. For
2022, 2021 and 2020, net losses attributable to non-controlling interests were
not material and, as a result, amounts are included on the consolidated
statement of operations within other income (expense).

Use of estimates \- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Future events
and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty; accordingly, accounting
estimates require the exercise of judgment. These financial statements were
prepared using information reasonably available as of December 31, 2022 and
through the date of this Report. The accounting estimates used in the
preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements may change as
new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is
obtained and as the Company's operating environment changes. Actual results
may differ from these estimates.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Revenue recognition \- Revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of
promised services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to
which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services.

Revenue from the Company's payment network is primarily generated by charging
fees to customers (issuers, acquirers and other market participants) for
providing switching and other network-related services, as well as by charging
fees to customers based primarily on the gross dollar volume of activity (GDV,
which includes both domestic and cross-border volume) on the cards that carry
the Company's brands. Revenue is recognized in the period in which the related
transactions and volume occur. Certain volume-based revenue is determined from
information reported by customers.

Revenue from the Company's value-added services and solutions is generated
through either fixed or transaction-based fees. These services and solutions
can be integrated and sold with the Company's payment network services or can
be sold on a stand-alone basis. Revenue from the Company's value-added
services and solutions is recognized in the period in which the related
services and solutions are performed or transactions occur. For services
provided to customers where delivery involves the use of a third-party, the
Company recognizes revenue on a gross basis if it acts as the principal,
controlling the service to the customer, or on a net basis if it acts as the
agent, arranging for the service to be provided.

Mastercard has business agreements with certain customers that provide for
rebates and incentives within net revenue that could be either fixed or
variable. Fixed incentives typically represent payments to a customer directly
related to entering into an agreement, which are generally capitalized and
amortized over the life of the agreement on a straight-line basis. Variable
rebates and incentives are recorded primarily when volume- and transaction-
based revenues are recognized over the contractual term. Variable rebates and
incentives are calculated based upon estimated customer performance, such as
volume thresholds, and the terms of the related business agreements.

Contract assets include unbilled consideration typically resulting from
executed data analytic and consulting services performed for customers in
connection with Mastercard's payments network service arrangements. Collection
for these services typically occurs over the contractual term. Contract assets
are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on
the consolidated balance sheet.

The Company defers the recognition of revenue when consideration has been
received prior to the satisfaction of performance obligations. As these
performance obligations are satisfied, revenue is subsequently recognized.
Deferred revenue primarily relates to certain value-added services and
solutions. Deferred revenue is included in other current liabilities and other
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.

Business combinations \- The Company accounts for business combinations under
the acquisition method of accounting. The Company measures the tangible and
intangible identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any non-
controlling interest in the acquiree and contingent consideration at fair
value as of the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as
incurred and are included in general and administrative expenses on the
consolidated statement of operations. Any excess purchase price over the fair
value of net assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, is
recorded as goodwill. Measurement period adjustments, if any, to the
preliminary estimated fair value of the intangibles assets as of the
acquisition date are recorded in goodwill.

Goodwill and other intangible assets \- Indefinite-lived intangible assets
consist of goodwill and customer relationships. Goodwill represents the
synergies expected to arise after the acquisition date and the assembled
workforce. Finite-lived intangible assets consist of capitalized software
costs, customer relationships and other intangible assets. Intangible assets
with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives, on a
straight-line basis, which range from one to twenty years. Capitalized
software includes internal and external costs incurred directly related to the
design, development and testing phases of each capitalized software project,
as well as technology acquired in business combinations.

The valuation methods for goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in
business combinations involve assumptions concerning comparable company
multiples, discount rates, growth projections and other assumptions of future
business conditions. The Company uses various valuation techniques to
determine the fair value of its intangible assets, primarily discounted cash
flows analysis, relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings. As the
assumptions employed to measure these assets are based on management's
judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are
classified in Level 3 of the Valuation Hierarchy (as defined in Fair value
subsection below).

Impairment of assets \- Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are
not amortized but tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level
in the fourth quarter, or sooner when circumstances indicate an impairment may
exist. The impairment evaluation for goodwill utilizes a qualitative
assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is
impaired. The qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to,
macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, operating
environment, financial performance and other relevant events. If it is
determined that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, then the
Company is required to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If the
fair value of the reporting unit

  

73 MASTERCARD 2022 FORM 10-K

* * *

  

PART II

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the fair value of the
reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then goodwill is impaired and
the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over the fair value is
recognized as an impairment charge.

The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a
qualitative assessment to evaluate relevant events and circumstances that
could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of
indefinite-lived intangible assets. If the qualitative assessment indicates
that it is more likely than not that indefinite-lived intangible assets are
impaired, then a quantitative assessment is required.

Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets,
are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their
carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of the asset
cannot be recovered from estimated future cash flows, undiscounted and without
interest, the fair value of the asset is calculated using the present value of
estimated net future cash flows. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds
its fair value, an impairment is recorded.

Impairment charges, if any, are recorded in general and administrative
expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.

Litigation \- The Company is a party to certain legal and regulatory
proceedings with respect to a variety of matters. The Company evaluates the
likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of all legal or regulatory proceedings to
which it is a party and accrues a loss contingency when the loss is probable
and reasonably estimable. Loss contingencies are recorded in provision for
litigation on the consolidated statement of operations. These judgments are
subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the
merits of its defenses and consultation with in-house and external legal
counsel. Legal costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in general and
administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.

Settlement and other risk management \- Mastercard's rules guarantee the
settlement of many of the transactions between its customers. Settlement
exposure is the outstanding settlement risk to customers under Mastercard's
rules due to the difference in timing between the payment transaction date and
subsequent settlement. For those transactions the Company guarantees, the
guarantee will cover the full amount of the settlement obligation to the
extent the settlement obligation is not otherwise satisfied. Settlement is
generally completed on a same-day basis, however, in some circumstances, funds
may not settle until subsequent business days creating a short-term settlement
exposure.

The Company also enters into agreements in the ordinary course of business
under which the Company agrees to indemnify third parties against damages,
losses and expenses incurred in connection with legal and other proceedings
arising from relationships or transactions with the Company. As the extent of
the Company's obligations under these agreements depends entirely upon the
occurrence of future events, the Company's potential future liability under
these agreements is not determinable.

The Company accounts for each of its guarantees by recording the guarantee at
its fair value at the inception or modification date through earnings.

Income taxes \- The Company follows an asset and liability based approach in
accounting for income taxes as required under GAAP. Deferred income tax assets
and liabilities are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years
of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and
income tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are
displayed separately as noncurrent assets and liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheet. Valuation allowances are provided against assets which are not
more likely than not to be realized. The Company recognizes all material tax
positions, including uncertain tax positions in which it is more likely than
not that the position will be sustained based on its technical merits and if
challenged by the relevant taxing authorities. At each balance sheet date,
unresolved uncertain tax positions are reassessed to determine whether
subsequent developments require a change in the amount of recognized tax
benefit. The allowance for uncertain tax positions is recorded in other
current and noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The
Company records interest expense related to income tax matters as interest
expense on the consolidated statement of operations. The Company includes
penalties related to income tax matters in the income tax provision.

Cash and cash equivalents \- Cash and cash equivalents include certain
investments with daily liquidity and with an original maturity of three months
or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are recorded at cost,
which approximates fair value.

Restricted cash \- The Company classifies cash and cash equivalents as
restricted when it is unavailable for withdrawal or use in its general
operations. The Company has the following types of restricted cash and
restricted cash equivalents which are included in the reconciliation of
beginning-of-period and end-of-period amounts shown on the consolidated
statement of cash flows:

•Restricted cash for litigation settlement \- The Company has restricted cash
for litigation within a qualified settlement fund related to the settlement
agreement for the U.S. merchant class litigation. The funds continue to be
restricted for payments until the litigation matter is resolved.

•Restricted security deposits held for customers \- The Company requires
certain customers to enter into risk mitigation arrangements, including cash
collateral and/or other forms of credit enhancement such as letters of credit
and guarantees, for settlement of their transactions. Certain risk mitigation
arrangements for settlement, such as standby letters of credit and bank

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

guarantees, are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company
also holds cash deposits and certificates of deposit from certain customers as
collateral for settlement of their transactions, which are recorded as assets
on the consolidated balance sheet. These assets are fully offset by
corresponding liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet. The
amount of these security deposits and the duration held are determined by the
risk profile of the individual customer and the Company's risk management
practices.

•Other restricted cash balances \- The Company has other restricted cash
balances which include contractually restricted deposits, as well as cash
balances that are restricted based on the Company's intention with regard to
usage. These funds are classified on the consolidated balance sheet within
prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets.

Fair value \- The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at
fair value on a recurring basis by estimating the price that would be received
upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants. The Company also measures certain
financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis, when a change in fair value or impairment is evidenced.
The Company classifies these recurring and nonrecurring fair value
measurements into a three-level hierarchy ("Valuation Hierarchy").

The Valuation Hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the
valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. A financial
instrument's categorization within the Valuation Hierarchy is based upon the
lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The
three levels of the Valuation Hierarchy are as follows:

•Level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted)
for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

•Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for
similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical
or similar assets and liabilities in inactive markets and inputs that are
observable for the asset or liability.

•Level 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and cannot be
directly corroborated by observable market data.

The Company's financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis include investment securities available for sale, marketable
securities, derivative instruments and deferred compensation. The Company's
financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring
basis include nonmarketable securities, debt and other financial instruments.
The Company's non-financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring
basis include property, equipment and right-of-use assets, goodwill and other
intangible assets and are subject to fair value adjustments in certain
circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment.

Contingent consideration \- Certain business combinations involve the
potential for future payment of consideration that is contingent upon the
achievement of performance milestones. These liabilities are classified within
Level 3 of the Valuation Hierarchy as the inputs used to measure fair value
are unobservable and require management's judgment. The fair value of the
contingent consideration at the acquisition date and subsequent periods is
determined utilizing an income approach based on a Monte Carlo technique and
is recorded in other current liabilities and other liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheet. Changes to projected performance milestones of the
acquired businesses could result in a higher or lower contingent consideration
liability. The changes in fair value as a result of updated assumptions are
recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement
of operations.

Investment securities \- The Company classifies investments as available-for-
sale or held-to-maturity at the date of acquisition.

•Available-for-sale debt securities:

◦Investments in debt securities that are available to meet the Company's
current operational needs are classified as current assets and the securities
that are not available for current operational needs are classified as
noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheet.

The debt securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and
losses, net of tax, recorded as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated statement of comprehensive
income. Net realized gains and losses on debt securities are recognized in
investment income on the consolidated statement of operations. The specific
identification method is used to determine realized gains and losses.

The Company evaluates its debt securities for impairment on an ongoing basis.
When there has been a decline in fair value of a debt security below the
amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes an impairment if: (1) it has the
intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be
required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis; or
(3) it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the
security. The credit loss component of the impairment is recognized as an
allowance and recorded in other income (expense), net on the consolidated
statement of operations while the non-credit related loss remains in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized from a sale or
subsequent impairment.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

•Held-to-maturity securities:

◦Time deposits - The Company classifies time deposits with original maturities
greater than three months as held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity securities
that mature within one year are classified as current assets within
investments on the consolidated balance sheet while held-to-maturity
securities with maturities of greater than one year are classified as other
assets. Time deposits are carried at amortized cost on the consolidated
balance sheet and are intended to be held until maturity.

Equity investments - The Company holds equity securities of publicly traded
and privately held companies.

•Marketable equity securities - Marketable equity securities are strategic
investments in publicly traded companies and are measured at fair value using
quoted prices in their respective active markets with changes recorded through
gains (losses) on equity investments, net on the consolidated statement of
operations. Marketable equity securities that are expected to be held as part
of the Company's long-term investment strategy are classified in other assets
on the consolidated balance sheet.

•Nonmarketable equity investments - The Company's nonmarketable equity
investments, which are reported in other assets on the consolidated balance
sheet, include investments in privately held companies without readily
determinable market values. The Company uses discounted cash flows and market
assumptions to estimate the fair value of its nonmarketable equity investments
when certain events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The
Company's nonmarketable equity investments are accounted for under the
measurement alternative method or equity method.

◦Measurement alternative method - The Company accounts for investments in
common stock or in-substance common stock under the measurement alternative
method of accounting when it does not exercise significant influence,
generally when it holds less than 20% ownership in the entity or when the
interest in a limited partnership or limited liability company is less than 5%
and the Company has no significant influence over the operations of the
investee. Investments in companies that Mastercard does not control, but that
are not in the form of common stock or in-substance common stock, are also
accounted for under the measurement alternative method of accounting.
Measurement alternative investments are measured at cost, less any impairment
and adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly
transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Fair
value adjustments, as well as impairments, are included in gains (losses) on
equity investments, net on the consolidated statement of operations.

◦Equity method - The Company accounts for investments in common stock or in-
substance common stock under the equity method of accounting when it has the
ability to exercise significant influence over the operations of the investee,
generally when it holds between 20% and 50% ownership in the entity. The
excess of the cost over the underlying net equity of investments accounted for
under the equity method is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible
assets and liabilities based on fair values at the date of acquisition. The
amortization of the excess of the cost over the underlying net equity of
investments and Mastercard's share of net earnings or losses of entities
accounted for under the equity method of accounting is included in other
income (expense), net on the consolidated statement of operations.

In addition, investments in flow-through entities such as limited partnerships
and limited liability companies are also accounted for under the equity method
when the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the
operations of the investee, generally when the investment ownership percentage
is equal to or greater than 5% of the outstanding ownership interest. The
Company's share of net earnings or losses for these investments are included
in gains (losses) on equity investments, net on the consolidated statement of
operations.

Derivative and hedging instruments \- The Company's derivative financial
instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet
and measured at fair value. The Company's foreign exchange and interest rate
derivative contracts are included in Level 2 of the Valuation Hierarchy as the
fair value of the contracts are based on inputs, which are observable based on
broker quotes for the same or similar instruments. The Company does not enter
into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. For
derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments, realized and
unrealized gains and losses from the change in fair value of the derivatives
are recognized in current earnings.

The Company's derivatives that are designated as hedging instruments are
required to meet established accounting criteria. In addition, an
effectiveness assessment is required to demonstrate that the derivative is
expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in fair value or cash
flows of the underlying exposure both at inception of the hedging relationship
and on an ongoing basis. The method of assessing hedge effectiveness and
measuring hedge results is formally documented at hedge inception and assessed
at least quarterly throughout the designated hedge period.

The Company may designate derivative instruments as cash flow, fair value and
net investment hedges, as follows:

•Cash flow hedges - Fair value adjustments to derivative instruments are
recorded, net of tax, in other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated
statement of comprehensive income. Any gains and losses deferred in
accumulated other

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

comprehensive income (loss) are subsequently reclassified to the corresponding
line item on the consolidated statement of operations when the underlying
hedged transactions impact earnings. For hedges that are no longer deemed
highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively, and any
gains and losses remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction
occurs. If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer
occur, the associated gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) are reclassified to the corresponding line item on the
consolidated statement of operations in current earnings.

•Fair value hedges - Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are
recorded in current-period earnings, along with the gain or loss on the hedged
asset or liability ("hedged item") that is attributable to the hedged risk.
All amounts recognized in earnings are recorded to the corresponding line item
on the consolidated statement of operations as the earnings effect of the
hedged item. Hedged items are measured on the consolidated balance sheet at
their carrying amount adjusted for any changes in fair value attributable to
the hedged risk ("basis adjustments"). The Company defers the amortization of
any basis adjustments until the end of the derivative instrument's term. If
the hedge designation is discontinued for reasons other than derecognition of
the hedged item, the remaining basis adjustments are amortized in accordance
with applicable GAAP for the hedged item.

•Net investment hedges - The Company has numerous investments in foreign
subsidiaries. The net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to volatility
in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may use foreign currency
denominated debt and/or derivative instruments to hedge a portion of its net
investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates.
The effective portion of the foreign currency gains and losses related to the
hedging instruments are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) on the consolidated balance sheet as a cumulative translation
adjustment component of equity. Gains and losses in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to earnings only if the Company
sells or substantially liquidates its net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Amounts excluded from effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are
recognized in earnings over the life of the hedging instrument. The Company
evaluates the effectiveness of the net investment hedge each quarter.

Settlement assets/obligations \- The Company operates systems for settling
payment transactions among participants in the payments ecosystem in which the
Company operates. Settlement is generally completed on a same-day basis,
however, in some circumstances, funds may not settle until subsequent business
days. In addition, the Company may receive or post funds in advance of
transactions related to certain payment capabilities over its multi-rail
payments network. The Company classifies the balances arising from these
various activities as settlement assets and settlement obligations.

Property, equipment and right-of-use assets \- Property and equipment are
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation
and amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets. Depreciation of leasehold improvements and
amortization of finance leases is included in depreciation and amortization
expense on the consolidated statement of operations. Operating lease
amortization expense is included in general and administrative expenses on the
consolidated statement of operations.

The useful lives of the Company's assets are as follows:

| | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Asset Category| | Estimated Useful Life  
Buildings| | 30 years  
Building equipment| |

10 \- 15 years  
  
Furniture and fixtures and equipment| |

3 \- 5 years  
  
Leasehold improvements| | Shorter of life of improvement or lease term  
Right-of-use assets| | Shorter of life of the asset or lease term  
  
The Company determines if a contract is, or contains, a lease at contract
inception. The Company's right-of-use ("ROU") assets are primarily related to
operating leases for office space, automobiles and other equipment. Leases are
included in property, equipment and right-of-use assets, other current
liabilities and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.

ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term
and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising
from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the
commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease
term. In addition, ROU assets include initial direct costs incurred by the
lessee as well as any lease payments made at or before the commencement date,
and exclude lease incentives. As most of the Company's leases do not provide
an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the
information available at the commencement date in determining the present
value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is determined by using
the rate of interest that the Company would pay to borrow on a collateralized
basis an amount equal to the lease payments for a similar term and in a
similar economic environment. Lease terms include options to extend or
terminate the lease when it is

PART II

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Leases with a
term of one year or less are excluded from ROU assets and liabilities.

The Company excludes variable lease payments in measuring ROU assets and lease
liabilities, other than those that depend on an index, a rate or are in-
substance fixed payments. Lease and nonlease components are generally
accounted for separately. When available, consideration is allocated to the
separate lease and nonlease components in a lease contract on a relative
standalone price basis using observable standalone prices.

Pension and other postretirement plans \- The Company recognizes the funded
status of its single-employer defined benefit pension plans and postretirement
plans as assets or liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet and
recognizes changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur
through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The funded status is
measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the
projected benefit obligation at December 31, the measurement date. Overfunded
plans, if any, are aggregated and recorded in other assets, while underfunded
plans are aggregated and recorded as accrued expenses and other liabilities on
the consolidated balance sheet.

Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost/(income), excluding the
service cost component, is recognized in other income (expense), net on the
consolidated statement of operations. These costs include interest cost,
expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service costs or credits
and gains or losses previously recognized as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss). The service cost component is recognized in
general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of
operations.

Defined contribution plans \- The Company's contributions to defined
contribution plans are recorded as employees render service to the Company.
The charge is recorded in general and administrative expenses on the
consolidated statement of operations.

Advertising and marketing \- Expenses incurred to promote Mastercard's brand,
products and services are recognized in advertising and marketing on the
consolidated statement of operations. The timing of recognition is dependent
on the type of advertising or marketing expense.

Foreign currency remeasurement and translation \- Monetary assets and
liabilities in a currency other than the functional currency are remeasured
using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary
assets and liabilities are recorded at historical exchange rates. Revenue and
expense accounts are remeasured at the weighted-average exchange rate for the
period. Resulting exchange gains and losses related to remeasurement are
included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement
of operations.

Where a non-U.S. currency is the functional currency, translation from that
functional currency to U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts
using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for
revenue and expense accounts using a weighted-average exchange rate for the
period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Treasury stock \- The Company records the repurchase of shares of its common
stock at cost on the trade date of the transaction. These shares are
considered treasury stock, which is a reduction to stockholders' equity.
Treasury stock is included in authorized and issued shares but excluded from
outstanding shares.

Share-based payments \- The Company measures share-based compensation expense
at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award and uses the
straight-line method of attribution, net of estimated forfeitures, for
expensing awards over the requisite employee service period. The Company
estimates the fair value of its non-qualified stock option awards ("Options")
using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of restricted stock
units ("RSUs") is determined and fixed on the grant date based on the
Company's stock price, adjusted for the exclusion of dividend equivalents. The
Monte Carlo simulation valuation model is used to determine the grant date
fair value of performance stock units ("PSUs") granted. All share-based
compensation expenses are recorded in general and administrative expenses on
the consolidated statement of operations.

Redeemable non-controlling interests \- The Company's business combinations
may include provisions allowing non-controlling equity owners the ability to
require the Company to purchase additional interests in the subsidiary at
their discretion. The interests are initially recorded at fair value and in
subsequent reporting periods are accreted or adjusted to the estimated
redemption value. The adjustments to the redemption value are recorded to
retained earnings or additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance
sheet. The redeemable non-controlling interests are considered temporary and
reported outside of permanent equity on the consolidated balance sheet at the
greater of the carrying amount adjusted for the non-controlling interest's
share of net income (loss) or its redemption value.

Earnings per share \- The Company calculates basic earnings per share ("EPS")
by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income
by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year,
adjusted for the potentially dilutive effect of stock options and unvested

stock units using the treasury stock method. The Company may be required to
calculate EPS using the two-class method as a result of its redeemable non-
controlling interests. If redemption value exceeds the fair value of the
redeemable non-controlling interests, the excess would be a reduction to net
income for the EPS calculation.

Note 2. Acquisitions

In 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company acquired several businesses for total
consideration of $0.3 billion, $4.7 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively,
representing both cash and contingent consideration. These acquisitions align
with the Company's strategy to grow, diversify and build the Company's
business. Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) for the
valuation techniques Mastercard utilizes to fair value the respective
components of business combinations and contingent consideration. The residual
value allocated to goodwill is primarily attributable to the synergies
expected to arise after the acquisition date and a majority of the goodwill is
not expected to be deductible for local tax purposes.

On April 1, 2022, Mastercard acquired a 100% equity interest in Dynamic Yield
LTD ("Dynamic Yield") for cash consideration of $325 million. The Company's
preliminary estimate of net assets acquired has been recorded primarily as
intangible assets, including goodwill of $200 million that is primarily
attributable to the synergies expected to arise after the acquisition date.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for local tax purposes.

On March 5, 2021, Mastercard acquired a majority of the Corporate Services
business of Nets Denmark A/S ("Nets") for €3.0 billion (approximately $3.6
billion as of the date of acquisition) in cash consideration based on a €2.85
billion enterprise value, adjusted for cash and net working capital at
closing. The business acquired is primarily comprised of clearing and instant
payment services and e-billing solutions. In relation to this acquisition, the
net assets acquired primarily relate to intangible assets, including goodwill
of $2.1 billion, of which $0.8 billion is expected to be deductible for local
tax purposes. The goodwill arising from this acquisition is primarily
attributable to the synergies expected to arise through geographic, product
and customer expansion, the underlying technology and workforce acquired.

On June 9, 2021, Mastercard acquired a 100% equity interest in Ekata, Inc.
("Ekata") for cash consideration of $861 million, based on an $850 million
enterprise value, adjusted for cash and net working capital at closing. The
acquisition of Ekata is expected to broaden the Company's digital identity
verification capabilities. The residual value allocated to goodwill is
primarily attributable to the synergies expected to arise after the
acquisition date and none of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for
local tax purposes.

Mastercard acquired additional businesses in 2021 for consideration of $272
million. These businesses were not considered individually material to
Mastercard.

Among the businesses acquired in 2020, the largest acquisition relates to
Finicity Corporation ("Finicity"), an open-banking provider, headquartered in
Salt Lake City, Utah. On November 18, 2020, Mastercard acquired 100% equity
interest in Finicity for cash consideration of $809 million. In addition, the
Finicity sellers earned additional contingent consideration of $64 million
upon meeting 2021 revenue targets in accordance with terms of the purchase
agreement. The additional businesses acquired in 2020 were not considered
individually material to Mastercard.

Note 3. Revenue

Mastercard is a payments network service provider that generates revenue from
a wide range of payment solutions provided to customers. Revenue from
contracts with customers is recognized when services are performed in an
amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be
entitled to in exchange for those services (i.e., fees charged to customers).
The Company disaggregates its net revenue from contracts with customers into
two categories: (i) payment network and (ii) value-added services and
solutions. The Company's net revenue categories, payment network and value-
added services and solutions, are recognized net of rebates and incentives
provided to customers. Rebates and incentives can be either fixed or variable
and are attributed to the category of revenue to which they pertain.

Payment network

Mastercard's payment network involves four participants in addition to the
Company: account holders (a person or entity who holds a card or uses another
device enabled for payment), issuers (the account holders' financial
institutions), merchants and acquirers (the merchants' financial
institutions). Revenue from the Company's payment network is primarily
generated by charging fees to customers (issuers, acquirers and other market
participants) for providing switching and other network-related services, as
well as by charging fees to customers based primarily on the gross dollar
volume of activity (GDV, which includes both domestic and cross-border volume)
on the cards that carry the Company's brands. As a payments network service
provider, the Company provides its

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

customers with continuous access to its global payments network and stands
ready to provide transaction processing over the contractual term.
Consideration is variable and is recognized as revenue in the period in which
volumes and transactions occur.

Value-added services and solutions

The Company generates revenues from value-added services and solutions through
either fixed or transaction-based fees. These services and solutions can be
integrated and sold with the Company's payment network services or can be sold
on a stand-alone basis. These services and solutions primarily include cyber
and intelligence, data and services, processing and gateway, ACH batch and
real-time account-based payments and solutions, open banking and digital
identity. Revenue from these value-added services and solutions is recognized
in the period in which the related services and solutions are performed or
transactions occur.

The Company's disaggregated net revenue by category and geographic region were

The Company's customers are generally billed weekly, however, the frequency is

The Company's remaining performance periods for its contracts with customers
for its payments network services are typically long-term in nature (generally
up to 10 years). As a payments network service provider, the Company provides
its customers with continuous access to its global payments network and stands
ready to provide transaction processing and related services over the
contractual term. Consideration is variable as the Company generates volume-
and transaction-based revenues from charging fees on its customers' current
period activity. The Company has elected the optional exemption to not
disclose the remaining performance obligations related to its payments network
services. The Company also earns revenue from value-added services and
solutions. At December 31, 2022, the estimated aggregate consideration
allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations for these value-added
services and solutions is $1.4 billion, which is expected to be recognized
through 2027. The estimated remaining performance obligations related to these
revenues are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including
modifications and terminations and are not expected to be material to any
future annual period.

Equity Investments

Included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet are equity
investments with readily determinable fair values ("Marketable securities")
and equity investments without readily determinable fair values
("Nonmarketable securities"). Marketable securities are equity interests in
publicly traded companies and are measured using unadjusted quoted prices in
their respective active markets. Nonmarketable securities that do not qualify
for equity method accounting are measured at cost, less any impairment and
adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly
transactions for the identical or similar investments of the same issuer
("Measurement alternative").

for identical assets in active markets. The fair value of the Company's
available-for-sale municipal securities, non-U.S. government and agency
securities and corporate securities are based on observable inputs such as
quoted prices, benchmark yields and issuer spreads for similar assets in
active markets and are therefore included in Level 2 of the Valuation
Hierarchy.

2The Company's foreign exchange and interest rate derivative asset and
liability contracts have been classified within Level 2 of the Valuation
Hierarchy as the fair value is based on observable inputs such as broker
quotes for similar derivative instruments. See Note 23 (Derivative and Hedging
Instruments) for further details.

3The Company's Marketable securities are publicly held and classified within
Level 1 of the Valuation Hierarchy as the fair values are based on unadjusted
quoted prices in their respective active markets.

4The Company has a nonqualified deferred compensation plan where assets are
invested primarily in mutual funds held in a rabbi trust, which is restricted
for payments to participants of the plan. The Company has elected to use the
fair value option for these mutual funds, which are measured using quoted
prices of identical instruments in active markets and are included in prepaid
expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet.

5The deferred compensation liabilities are measured at fair value based on the
quoted prices of identical instruments to the investment vehicles selected by
the participants. These are included in other liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheet.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Financial Instruments - Nonrecurring Measurements

Nonmarketable Securities

The Company's Nonmarketable securities are recorded at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis in periods after initial recognition under the equity
method or measurement alternative method. Nonmarketable securities are
classified within Level 3 of the Valuation Hierarchy due to the absence of
quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and unobservable inputs
used to measure fair value that require management's judgment. The Company
uses discounted cash flows and market assumptions to estimate the fair value
of its Nonmarketable securities when certain events or circumstances indicate
that impairment may exist. See Note 7 (Investments) for further details.

Debt

The Company estimates the fair value of its debt based on either market quotes
or observable market data. Debt is classified as Level 2 of the Valuation
Hierarchy as it is generally not traded in active markets. At December 31,
2022, the carrying value and fair value of debt was $14.0 billion and $12.7
billion, respectively. At December 31, 2021, the carrying value and fair value
of debt was $13.9 billion and $15.3 billion, respectively. See Note 15 (Debt)
for further details.

Other Financial Instruments

Certain other financial instruments are carried on the consolidated balance
sheet at cost or amortized cost basis, which approximates fair value due to
their short-term, highly liquid nature. These instruments include cash and
cash equivalents, restricted cash, time deposits, accounts receivable,
settlement assets, restricted security deposits held for customers, accounts
payable, settlement obligations and other accrued liabilities.

The increase in the gross carrying amount of amortized intangible assets in
2022 was primarily related to software additions and the business acquired in
2022. See Note 2 (Acquisitions) for further details. Certain intangible assets
are denominated in foreign currencies. As such, the change in intangible
assets includes a component attributable to foreign currency translation.
Based on the qualitative assessment performed in 2022, it was determined that
the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets were not impaired.

Amortization on the assets above amounted to $414 million, $424 million and
$303 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The following table sets
forth the estimated future amortization expense on finite-lived intangible
assets on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022 for the years

country of employment. Additionally, Vocalink has a defined benefit pension
plan (the "Vocalink Plan") which was permanently closed to new entrants and
future accruals as of July 21, 2013, however, plan participants' obligations
are adjusted for future salary changes. The term "Pension Plans" includes the
non-U.S. Plans and the Vocalink Plan.

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company's aggregated Pension Plan assets
exceeded the benefit obligations. For plans where the benefit obligations
exceeded plan assets, the projected benefit obligation was $8 million and $116
million, the accumulated benefit obligation was $6 million and $115 million
and plan assets were $2 million and $104 million at December 31, 2022 and
2021, respectively. Information on the Pension Plans were as follows as of
December 31:

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company's projected benefit
obligation related to its Pension Plans decreased $204 million, primarily
attributable to actuarial gains related to higher discount rate assumptions.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company's projected benefit
obligation related to its Pension Plans decreased $8 million, primarily
attributable to actuarial gains related to higher discount rate assumptions.

Components of net periodic benefit cost recorded in earnings were as follows

The Company's discount rate assumptions are based on yield curves derived from
high quality corporate bonds, which are matched to the expected cash flows of
each respective plan. The expected return on plan assets assumptions are
derived using the current and expected asset allocations of the Pension Plans'
assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various
classes of plan assets. The rates of compensation increases are determined by
the Company, based upon its long-term plans for such increases.

The following additional assumptions were used at December 31 in accounting
for the Postretirement Plan:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | 2022| | 2021  
Healthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year| | 6.50 | %| | 6.75 | %  
Ultimate trend rate | | 5.00 | %| | 5.00 | %  
Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate| | 6| | 7  
  
Assets

Plan assets are managed taking into account the timing and amount of future
benefit payments. The Vocalink Plan assets are managed with the following
target asset allocations: cash and cash equivalents 14%, U.K. government
securities 41%, fixed income 18%, equity 16% and real estate 11%. For the
non-U.S. Plans, the assets are concentrated primarily in insurance contracts.

The Valuation Hierarchy of the Pension Plans' assets is determined using a
consistent application of the categorization measurements for the Company's
financial instruments. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies)
for additional information.

1Cash and cash equivalents are valued at quoted market prices, which represent
the net asset value of the shares held by the Plans.

2Certain mutual funds are valued at quoted market prices, which represent the
value of the shares held by the Plans, and are therefore included in Level 1.
Certain other mutual funds are valued at unit values provided by investment
managers, which are based on the fair value of the underlying investments
utilizing public information, independent external valuation from third-party
services or third-party advisors, and are therefore included in Level 2.

3Insurance contracts are valued at unit values provided by investment
managers, which are based on the fair value of the underlying investments
utilizing public information, independent external valuation from third-party
services or third-party advisors.

4Investments at NAV include mutual funds (comprised primarily of credit
investments) and other investments (comprised primarily of real estate
investments) and are valued using the net asset value provided by the
administrator as a practical expedient, and therefore these investments are
not included in the valuation hierarchy. These investments have quarterly
redemption frequencies with redemption notice periods ranging from 60 to 90
days.

The following table summarizes expected benefit payments (as of December 31,

In March 2021, the Company issued $600 million principal amount of notes due
March 2031 and $700 million principal amount of notes due March 2051. In
November 2021, the Company also issued $750 million principal amount of notes
due November 2031. The two issuances in 2021 are collectively referred to as
the "2021 USD Notes". The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 USD
Notes, after deducting the original issue discount, underwriting discount and
offering expenses, were $2.024 billion.

In March 2020, the Company issued $1 billion principal amount of notes due
March 2027, $1.5 billion principal amount of notes due March 2030 and $1.5
billion principal amount of notes due March 2050 (collectively the "2020 USD

deducting the original issue discount, underwriting discount and offering
expenses, were $3.959 billion.

The Senior Notes described above are not subject to any financial covenants
and may be redeemed in whole, or in part, at the Company's option at any time
for a specified make-whole amount. These notes are senior unsecured
obligations and would rank equally with any future unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness.

Indian Rupee ("INR") Term Loan

In July 2022, the Company entered into an unsecured INR22.7 billion ($275
million as of December 31, 2022) term loan due July 2023 (the "INR Term
Loan"). The net proceeds of the INR Term Loan, after deducting issuance costs,
were INR22.6 billion ($284 million as of the date of settlement).

The Company obtained the INR Term Loan to serve as an economic hedge to offset
possible changes in the value of INR-denominated monetary assets due to
foreign exchange fluctuations. The INR Term Loan is not subject to any
financial covenants and it may be repaid in whole at the Company's option at
any time for a specified make-whole amount.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company has a commercial paper program (the
"Commercial Paper Program") under which the Company is authorized to issue up
to $6 billion in unsecured commercial paper notes with maturities of up to 397
days from the date of issuance. On January 27, 2023, the Company increased its
Commercial Paper Program from $6 billion to $8 billion. The Commercial Paper
Program is available in U.S. dollars.

In conjunction with the Commercial Paper Program, the Company entered into a
committed five-year unsecured $8 billion revolving credit facility (the
"Credit Facility") on November 10, 2022. The Credit Facility, which expires on
November 10, 2027, amended and restated the Company's prior $6 billion credit
facility which was set to expire on November 12, 2026. Borrowings under the
Credit Facility are available in U.S. dollars and/or euros. The facility fee
under the Credit Facility is determined according to the Company's credit
rating and is payable on the average daily commitment, regardless of usage,
per annum. In addition to the facility fee, interest rates on borrowings under
the Credit Facility would be based on prevailing market interest rates plus
applicable margins that fluctuate based on the Company's credit rating. The
Credit Facility contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative
and negative covenants, events of default and indemnification provisions. The
Company was in compliance in all material respects with the covenants of the
Credit Facility at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility are to
be used to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, including
providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by the
Company's customers. The Company may borrow and repay amounts under the
Commercial Paper Program and Credit Facility from time to time. The Company
had no borrowings under the Credit Facility or the Commercial Paper Program at
December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Mastercard Foundation

In connection and simultaneously with its 2006 initial public offering (the
"IPO"), the Company issued and donated 135 million newly authorized shares of
Class A common stock to Mastercard Foundation. Mastercard Foundation is a
private charitable foundation incorporated in Canada that is controlled by
directors who are independent of the Company and its principal customers.
Under the terms of the donation, Mastercard Foundation became able to resell
the donated shares in May 2010 to the extent necessary to meet charitable
disbursement requirements pursuant to Canadian tax law. Under such current
law, Mastercard Foundation must annually disburse at least 3.5% of its assets
not used in its charitable activities and administration in the previous eight
quarters ("Disbursement Quota"). However, Mastercard Foundation obtained
permission from the Canada Revenue Agency to, until December 31, 2021, meet
its cumulative Disbursement Quota obligations over a period of time that, on
average, demonstrated compliance with the requirement for such established
time period. Currently, Mastercard Foundation may not sell or otherwise
transfer its donated shares prior to May 1, 2027, except to the extent
necessary to satisfy the Disbursement Quota. Based on that timing, Mastercard
Foundation would be permitted to sell all of its remaining shares beginning
May 1, 2027, subject to certain conditions.

1During 2022, the increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss related
to foreign currency translation adjustments was driven primarily by the
depreciation of the euro and British pound against the U.S. dollar. During
2021, the increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss related to
foreign currency translation adjustments was driven primarily by the
depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar.

2During 2022 and 2021, the increase in the accumulated other comprehensive
income related to the net investment hedges was driven by the depreciation of
the euro against the U.S. dollar. See Note 23 (Derivative and Hedging
Instruments) for additional information.

3Certain foreign exchange derivative contracts are designated as cash flow
hedging instruments. Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value
of these contracts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) and subsequently reclassified to the consolidated statement of
operations when the underlying hedged transactions impact earnings. See Note
23 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) for additional information.

4During 2022, the increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss related
to the Plans was driven primarily by a net actuarial loss within the Pension
Plans. During 2021, the increase in the accumulated other comprehensive income
related to the Plans was driven primarily by a net actuarial gain within the
Pension Plans. See Note 14 (Pension, Postretirement and Savings Plans) for
additional information.

Note 18. Share-Based Payments

In May 2006, the Company granted the following awards under the Mastercard
Incorporated 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan, which was amended and restated as
of June 22, 2021 (the "LTIP"). The LTIP is a stockholder-approved plan that
permits the grant of various types of equity awards to employees. The Company
has granted Options, RSUs and PSUs under the LTIP. The Company uses the
straight-line method of attribution for expensing all equity awards.
Compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures, with estimates
adjusted as appropriate.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

There are approximately 116 million shares of Class A common stock authorized
for equity awards under the LTIP. Although the LTIP permits the issuance of
shares of Class B common stock, no such shares have been authorized for
issuance. Shares issued as a result of Option exercises and the conversions of
RSUs and PSUs were funded primarily with the issuance of new shares of Class A
common stock.

Stock Options

Options expire ten years from the date of grant and vest ratably over three
years for awards granted on or after March 1, 2022. For awards granted before
March 1, 2022, they vest ratably over four years. For Options granted, a
participant's unvested awards are forfeited upon termination. In the event a
participant terminates employment due to disability or retirement more than
seven months after receiving the award, however, the participant retains all
of their awards without providing additional service to the Company.
Retirement eligibility is dependent upon age and years of service.
Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period as stated in the
LTIP.

The fair value of each Option is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-
Scholes option pricing model. The following table presents the weighted-
average assumptions used in the valuation and the resulting weighted-average
fair value per Option granted for the years ended December 31:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

Weighted-average fair value per Option granted| | $| 86.92 | | | $| 91.70 | |
| $| 80.92 |  
  
The risk-free rate of return was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in
effect on the date of grant. The expected term and the expected volatility
were based on historical Mastercard information. The expected dividend yields
were based on the Company's expected annual dividend rate on the date of
grant.

Restricted Stock Units

For RSUs granted on or after March 1, 2022, the awards generally vest ratably
over three years. For RSUs granted on or after March 1, 2020 but before March
1, 2022, the awards generally vest ratably over four years. A participant's
unvested awards are forfeited upon termination of employment. In the event of
termination due to job elimination (as defined by the Company), however, a
participant will retain a pro-rata portion of the unvested awards for services
performed through the date of termination. In the event a participant
terminates employment due to disability or retirement more than seven months
after receiving the award, the participant retains all of their awards without
providing additional service to the Company. Compensation expense is
recognized over the shorter of the vesting periods stated in the LTIP or the
date the individual becomes eligible to retire but not less than seven months.

RSUs expected to vest at December 31, 2022| | 1.8 | | | $| 335 | | | $| 615 |  
  
The fair value of each RSU is the closing stock price on the New York Stock
Exchange of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant, adjusted
for the exclusion of dividend equivalents. Upon vesting, a portion of the RSU
award may be withheld to satisfy the minimum statutory withholding taxes. The
remaining RSUs will be settled in shares of the Company's Class A common stock
after the vesting period. As of December 31, 2022, there was $334 million of
total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs. The cost is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years.

Performance Stock Units

PSUs vest after three years and are subject to a mandatory one-year post-vest
hold, during which they are eligible for dividend equivalents. A participant's
unvested awards are forfeited upon termination of employment. In the event of
termination due to job elimination (as defined by the Company), however, a
participant will retain a pro-rata portion of the unvested awards for services
performed through the date of termination. In the event a participant
terminates employment due to disability or retirement more than seven months

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Since 2013, PSUs containing performance and market conditions have been
issued. Performance measures used to determine the actual number of shares
that vest after three years include net revenue growth, EPS growth and
relative total shareholder return ("TSR"). Relative TSR is considered a market
condition, while net revenue and EPS growth are considered performance
conditions. The Monte Carlo simulation valuation model is used to determine
the grant-date fair value.

Compensation expense for PSUs is recognized over the requisite service period,
or the date the individual becomes eligible to retire but not less than seven
months, if it is probable that the performance target will be achieved and
subsequently adjusted if the probability assessment changes. During the year
ended December 31, 2020, performance targets related to PSU awards granted in
2018 ("2018 PSU Awards") were adjusted to exclude certain pandemic-related
financial impacts deemed outside of the Company's control. The adjustment
during the year ended December 31, 2020 required the Company to apply
modification accounting to the 2018 PSU Awards which had an immaterial impact
on compensation expense. As of December 31, 2022, there was $29 million of
total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested PSUs. The cost is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years.

The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and
2020 were 15.4%, 15.7% and 17.4%, respectively. The effective income tax rate
for 2022 was lower than the effective income tax rate for 2021, primarily due
to a discrete tax benefit in the first quarter of 2022 related to final U.S.
tax regulations published in the current year. These regulations resulted in a
valuation allowance release of $333 million associated with the U.S. foreign
tax credit carryforward deferred tax asset. The

regulations limit the Company's ability to generate foreign tax credits
starting in 2022 for certain foreign taxes paid, resulting in additional U.S.
tax expense. Additionally, a more favorable geographic mix of earnings in 2022
contributed to the lower effective tax rate. The lower effective income tax
rate in 2022 was partially offset by:

•the recognition of U.S. tax benefits in 2021 (the majority of which were
discrete) resulting from a higher foreign derived intangible income deduction
and greater utilization of foreign tax credits in the U.S.

•a discrete tax benefit in 2021 related to the remeasurement of the Company's
net deferred tax asset in the U.K. due to an enacted tax rate change in 2021

•a discrete tax expense related to an unfavorable court ruling in 2022

The effective income tax rate for 2021 was lower than the effective income tax
rate for 2020, primarily due to the recognition of U.S. tax benefits (the
majority of which were discrete) resulting from a higher foreign derived
intangible income deduction and greater utilization of foreign tax credits in
the U.S. In addition, a more favorable geographic mix of earnings in 2021
contributed to the Company's lower effective tax rate. These benefits were
partially offset by a lower discrete tax benefit related to share-based
payments in 2021.

Singapore Income Tax Rate

In connection with the expansion of the Company's operations in the Asia
Pacific, Middle East and Africa region, the Company's subsidiary in Singapore,
Mastercard Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd. ("MAPPL") received an incentive grant from
the Singapore Ministry of Finance in 2010. The incentive had provided MAPPL
with, among other benefits, a reduced income tax rate for the 10-year period
commencing January 1, 2010 on taxable income in excess of a base amount. The
Company continued to explore business opportunities in this region, resulting
in an expansion of the incentives being granted by the Ministry of Finance,
including a further reduction to the income tax rate on taxable income in
excess of a revised fixed base amount commencing July 1, 2011 and continuing
through December 31, 2025. Without the incentive grant, MAPPL would have been
subject to the statutory income tax rate on its earnings. For 2022, 2021 and
2020, the impact of the incentive grant received from the Ministry of Finance
resulted in a reduction of MAPPL's income tax liability of $454 million, or
$0.47 per diluted share, $300 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, and $260
million, or $0.26 per diluted share, respectively.

Indefinite Reinvestment

As of December 31, 2022 the Company does not accrue taxes on $1.6 billion of
foreign earnings which remain permanently reinvested outside the U.S. The
Company expects that taxes associated with any future repatriation of these
earnings are immaterial.

The valuation allowance balance at December 31, 2022 primarily related to the
Company's ability to recognize future tax benefits associated with certain
foreign losses. The recognition of the foreign losses is dependent on the
timing and character of future taxable income in the applicable jurisdictions.
The valuation allowance balance at December 31, 2021 primarily related to the
Company's ability to recognize future tax benefits associated with the carry
forward of U.S. foreign tax credits and certain foreign losses. The valuation
allowance associated with the carryforward of U.S. foreign tax credits was
released in 2022 as a result of the publication of final U.S. tax regulations.
The regulations limit the Company's ability to generate foreign tax credits
for certain taxes paid beginning in 2022, but have the effect of allowing the
Company to utilize its foreign tax credit carryforwards.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had foreign tax credit and tax effected
net operating loss carryforwards of $274 million and $156 million,
respectively. The foreign tax credits begin to expire in 2029 and the majority
of the net operating losses can be carried forward indefinitely.

As of December 31, 2022, the amount of unrecognized tax benefit was $414
million. This amount, if recognized, would reduce the effective income tax
rate by $362 million. The Company's unrecognized tax benefits increased in
2020 primarily due to a prior year tax issue resulting from a refund claim
filed in 2020.

The Company is subject to tax in the U.S., Belgium, Singapore, the United
Kingdom and various other foreign jurisdictions, as well as state and local
jurisdictions. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and
are adjusted after considering facts and circumstances, including progress of
tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitation.
Within the next twelve months, the Company believes that the resolution of
certain federal, foreign and state and local examinations is reasonably
possible and that a change in estimate, reducing unrecognized tax benefits,
may occur. While such a change may be significant, it is not possible to
provide a range of the potential change until the examinations progress
further or the related statutes of limitation expire. The Company has
effectively settled its U.S. federal income tax obligations through 2014. With
limited exception, the Company is no longer subject to state and local or
foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before 2011.

Note 21. Legal and Regulatory Proceedings

Mastercard is a party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a
variety of matters in the ordinary course of business. Some of these
proceedings are based on complex claims involving substantial uncertainties
and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as discussed below, it is not
possible to determine the probability of loss or estimate damages, and
therefore, Mastercard has not established reserves for any of these
proceedings.  When the Company determines that a loss is both probable and
reasonably estimable, Mastercard records a liability and discloses the amount
of the liability if it is material. When a material loss contingency is only
reasonably possible, Mastercard does not record a liability, but instead
discloses the nature and the amount of the claim, and an estimate of the loss
or range of loss, if such an estimate can be made. Unless otherwise stated
below with respect to these matters, Mastercard cannot provide an estimate of
the possible loss or range of loss based on one or more of the following
reasons: (1) actual or potential plaintiffs have not claimed an amount of
monetary damages or the amounts are unsupportable or exaggerated, (2) the
matters are in early stages, (3) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of
pending appeals or motions, (4) there are significant factual issues to be
resolved, (5) the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants or
potential defendants whose share of any potential financial responsibility has
yet to be determined and/or (6) there are novel legal issues presented.
Furthermore, except as identified with respect to the matters below,
Mastercard does not believe that the outcome of any individual existing legal
or regulatory proceeding to which it is a party will have a material adverse
effect on its results of operations, financial condition and overall business.
However, an adverse judgment or other outcome or settlement with respect to
any proceedings discussed below could result in fines or payments by
Mastercard and/or could require Mastercard to change its business practices.
In addition, an adverse outcome in a regulatory proceeding could lead to the
filing of civil damage claims and possibly result in significant damage
awards. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on
Mastercard's results of operations, financial condition and overall business.

Interchange Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings

Mastercard's interchange fees and other practices are subject to regulatory,
legal review and/or challenges in a number of jurisdictions, including the
proceedings described below. When taken as a whole, the resulting decisions,
regulations and legislation with respect to interchange fees and acceptance
practices may have a material adverse effect on the Company's prospects for
future growth and its overall results of operations, financial position and
cash flows.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

United States. In June 2005, the first of a series of complaints were filed on
behalf of merchants (the majority of the complaints were styled as class
actions, although a few complaints were filed on behalf of individual merchant
plaintiffs) against Mastercard International, Visa U.S.A., Inc., Visa
International Service Association and a number of financial institutions.
Taken together, the claims in the complaints were generally brought under both
Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, which prohibit monopolization and
attempts or conspiracies to monopolize a particular industry, and some of
these complaints contain unfair competition law claims under state law. The
complaints allege, among other things, that Mastercard, Visa, and certain
financial institutions conspired to set the price of interchange fees, enacted
point of sale acceptance rules (including the no surcharge rule) in violation
of antitrust laws and engaged in unlawful tying and bundling of certain
products and services, resulting in merchants paying excessive costs for the
acceptance of Mastercard and Visa credit and debit cards. The cases were
consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of New York in MDL No. 1720. The plaintiffs filed a
consolidated class action complaint seeking treble damages.

In July 2006, the group of purported merchant class plaintiffs filed a
supplemental complaint alleging that Mastercard's initial public offering of
its Class A Common Stock in May 2006 (the "IPO") and certain purported
agreements entered into between Mastercard and financial institutions in
connection with the IPO: (1) violate U.S. antitrust laws and (2) constituted a
fraudulent conveyance because the financial institutions allegedly attempted
to release, without adequate consideration, Mastercard's right to assess them
for Mastercard's litigation liabilities. The class plaintiffs sought treble
damages and injunctive relief including, but not limited to, an order
reversing and unwinding the IPO.

In February 2011, Mastercard and Mastercard International entered into each
of: (1) an omnibus judgment sharing and settlement sharing agreement with Visa
Inc., Visa U.S.A. Inc. and Visa International Service Association and a number
of financial institutions; and (2) a Mastercard settlement and judgment
sharing agreement with a number of financial institutions. The agreements
provide for the apportionment of certain costs and liabilities which
Mastercard, the Visa parties and the financial institutions may incur, jointly
and/or severally, in the event of an adverse judgment or settlement of one or
all of the merchant litigation cases. Among a number of scenarios addressed by
the agreements, in the event of a global settlement involving the Visa
parties, the financial institutions and Mastercard, Mastercard would pay 12%
of the monetary portion of the settlement. In the event of a settlement
involving only Mastercard and the financial institutions with respect to their
issuance of Mastercard cards, Mastercard would pay 36% of the monetary portion
of such settlement.

In October 2012, the parties entered into a definitive settlement agreement
with respect to the merchant class litigation (including with respect to the
claims related to the IPO) and the defendants separately entered into a
settlement agreement with the individual merchant plaintiffs. The settlements
included cash payments that were apportioned among the defendants pursuant to
the omnibus judgment sharing and settlement sharing agreement described above.
Mastercard also agreed to provide class members with a short-term reduction in
default credit interchange rates and to modify certain of its business
practices, including its "no surcharge" rule. The court granted final approval
of the settlement in December 2013, and objectors to the settlement appealed
that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In June
2016, the court of appeals vacated the class action certification, reversed
the settlement approval and sent the case back to the district court for
further proceedings. The court of appeals' ruling was based primarily on
whether the merchants were adequately represented by counsel in the
settlement. As a result of the appellate court ruling, the district court
divided the merchants' claims into two separate classes - monetary damages
claims (the "Damages Class") and claims seeking changes to business practices
(the "Rules Relief Class"). The court appointed separate counsel for each
class.

In September 2018, the parties to the Damages Class litigation entered into a
class settlement agreement to resolve the Damages Class claims. The time
period during which Damages Class members were permitted to opt out of the
class settlement agreement ended in July 2019 with merchants representing
slightly more than 25% of the Damages Class interchange volume choosing to opt
out of the settlement. The district court granted final approval of the
settlement in December 2019. The district court's settlement approval order
has been appealed and oral argument on the appeal was heard in March 2022.
Mastercard has commenced settlement negotiations with a number of the opt-out
merchants and has reached settlements and/or agreements in principle to settle
a number of these claims. The Damages Class settlement agreement does not
relate to the Rules Relief Class claims. Separate settlement negotiations with
the Rules Relief Class are ongoing. Briefing on summary judgment motions in
the Rules Relief Class and opt-out merchant cases was completed in December
2020. In September 2021, the district court granted the Rules Relief Class's
motion for class certification.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Mastercard had accrued a liability of $894
million and $783 million, respectively, as a reserve for both the Damages
Class litigation and the opt-out merchant cases. During 2022, Mastercard
recorded an additional accrual of $133 million as a result of a change in
estimate with respect to the claims of merchants who opted out of the Damages
Class litigation. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Mastercard had $589
million and $586 million, respectively, in a qualified cash settlement fund
related to the Damages Class litigation and classified as restricted cash on
its consolidated balance sheet. The reserve as of December 31, 2022 for both
the Damages Class litigation and the opt-out merchants represents Mastercard's
best estimate of its

probable liabilities in these matters. The portion of the accrued liability
relating to both the opt-out merchants and the Damages Class litigation
settlement does not represent an estimate of a loss, if any, if the matters
were litigated to a final outcome. Mastercard cannot estimate the potential
liability if that were to occur.

Europe. Since May 2012, a number of United Kingdom ("U.K.") merchants filed
claims or threatened litigation against Mastercard seeking damages for
excessive costs paid for acceptance of Mastercard credit and debit cards
arising out of alleged anti-competitive conduct with respect to, among other
things, Mastercard's cross-border interchange fees and its U.K. and Ireland
domestic interchange fees (the "U.K. Merchant claimants"). In addition,
Mastercard, has faced similar filed or threatened litigation by merchants with
respect to interchange rates in other countries in Europe (the "Pan-European
Merchant claimants"). Mastercard has resolved a substantial amount of these
damages claims through settlement or judgment. During 2022, Mastercard
incurred charges of $223 million as a result of settlements (both final and
agreements in principle) with a number of U.K. merchants. During 2021 and
2020, Mastercard incurred charges of $94 million and $28 million,
respectively, to reflect both the litigation settlements and estimated
attorneys' fees with a number of U.K. and Pan-European merchants. Following
these settlements, an amount in excess of £0.6 billion (approximately $0.7
billion as of December 31, 2022) of unresolved damages claims remain.

In January 2017, Mastercard received a liability judgment in its favor on all
significant matters in a separate action brought by ten of the U.K. Merchant
claimants. Three of the U.K. Merchant claimants appealed the judgment, and
these appeals were combined with Mastercard's appeal of a 2016 judgment in
favor of one U.K. merchant. In July 2018, the U.K. appellate court heard the
appeals of the four merchant claimants and ruled against both Mastercard and
Visa on two of the three legal issues being considered. The parties appealed
the rulings to the U.K. Supreme Court. In June 2020, the U.K. Supreme Court
ruled against Mastercard and Visa with respect to one of the liability issues
being considered by the Court related to U.K domestic interchange fees.
Additionally, the U.K. Supreme Court set out the legal standard that should be
applied by lower trial courts with respect to determining whether interchange
was exemptible under applicable law, and provided guidance to lower courts
with regard to the legal standard that should be applied in assessing
merchants' damages claims. The U.K. Supreme Court sent three of the merchant
cases back to the trial court solely for the purpose of determining damages
issues. Mastercard subsequently reached settlement agreements with all four
merchants.

Mastercard continues to litigate with the remaining U.K. and Pan-European
Merchant claimants and it has submitted statements of defense disputing
liability and damages claims. A number of those matters are now progressing
with motion practice and discovery. In one of the actions involving multiple
merchant plaintiff claims, the U.K. trial court in November 2021 denied the
plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on certain liability issues. In
October 2022, the appellate court rejected the plaintiffs' appeal. In a
separate matter filed in Belgium involving multiple merchants from the Czech
Republic and Slovakia, the trial court held a hearing in June 2022 on
liability issues, and the decision is pending.

During the third quarter of 2022, Mastercard and Visa were served with a
proposed collective action complaint in the U.K. on behalf of merchants
seeking damages for commercial card transactions and inter-regional consumer
card transactions in both the U.K. and the European Union. The plaintiffs have
claimed damages against Mastercard of approximately £0.5 billion
(approximately $0.6 billion as of December 31, 2022). The court has scheduled
a hearing on the plaintiffs' collective action application for April 2023.

In September 2016, a proposed collective action was filed in the United
Kingdom on behalf of U.K. consumers seeking damages for intra-EEA and domestic
U.K. interchange fees that were allegedly passed on to consumers by merchants
between 1992 and 2008. The complaint, which seeks to leverage the European
Commission's 2007 decision on intra-EEA interchange fees, claims damages in an
amount that exceeds £14 billion (approximately $17 billion as of December 31,
2022). Following various hearings since July 2017 regarding collective action
and scope, in August 2021, the trial court issued a decision in which it
granted class certification to the plaintiffs but narrowed the scope of the
class. In January 2023, the trial court held a hearing on Mastercard's request
to narrow the number of years of damages sought by the plaintiffs on statute
of limitations grounds. The trial court has scheduled an additional hearing
for July 2023 regarding Mastercard's request to preclude the plaintiffs from
seeking damages with respect to U.K. domestic interchange fees.

Mastercard has been named as a defendant in a proposed consumer collective
action filed in Portugal on behalf of Portuguese consumers. The complaint,
which seeks to leverage the 2019 resolution of the European Commission's
investigation of Mastercard's central acquiring rules and interregional
interchange fees, claims damages of approximately €0.4 billion (approximately
$0.4 billion as of December 31, 2022) for interchange fees that were allegedly
passed on to consumers by Portuguese merchants for a period of approximately
20 years. Mastercard has submitted a statement of defense that disputes both
liability and damages.

Australia. In May 2022, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission
("ACCC") filed a complaint targeting certain agreements entered into by
Mastercard and certain Australian merchants related to Mastercard's debit
program. The ACCC alleges that by entering into such agreements, Mastercard
engaged in conduct with the purpose of substantially lessening competition in
the supply of debit card acceptance services. The ACCC seeks both declaratory
relief and monetary fines and costs.

ATM Non-Discrimination Rule Surcharge Complaints

United States. In October 2011, a trade association of independent Automated
Teller Machine ("ATM") operators and 13 independent ATM operators filed a
complaint styled as a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia against both Mastercard and Visa (the "ATM Operators
Complaint"). Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of non-bank operators of ATM
terminals that operate in the United States with the discretion to determine
the price of the ATM access fee for the terminals they operate. Plaintiffs
allege that Mastercard and Visa have violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act by
imposing rules that require ATM operators to charge non-discriminatory ATM
surcharges for transactions processed over Mastercard's and Visa's respective
networks that are not greater than the surcharge for transactions over other
networks accepted at the same ATM. Plaintiffs seek both injunctive and
monetary relief equal to treble the damages they claim to have sustained as a
result of the alleged violations and their costs of suit, including attorneys'
fees.

Subsequently, multiple related complaints were filed in the U.S. District
Court for the District of Columbia alleging both federal antitrust and
multiple state unfair competition, consumer protection and common law claims
against Mastercard and Visa on behalf of putative classes of users of ATM
services (the "ATM Consumer Complaints"). The claims in these actions largely
mirror the allegations made in the ATM Operators Complaint, although these
complaints seek damages on behalf of consumers of ATM services who pay
allegedly inflated ATM fees at both bank and non-bank ATM operators as a
result of the defendants' ATM rules. Plaintiffs seek both injunctive and
monetary relief equal to treble the damages they claim to have sustained as a
result of the alleged violations and their costs of suit, including attorneys'
fees.

In January 2012, the plaintiffs in the ATM Operators Complaint and the ATM
Consumer Complaints filed amended class action complaints that largely mirror
their prior complaints. In September 2019, the plaintiffs filed with the
district court their motions for class certification in which the plaintiffs,
in aggregate, allege over $1 billion in damages against all of the defendants.
In August 2021, the trial court issued an order granting the plaintiffs'
request for class certification. Visa and Mastercard subsequently appealed the
certification decision to the appellate court and oral argument on the appeal
was heard in September 2022.

Europe. Mastercard has been named as a defendant in an action brought by
Euronet 360 Finance Limited, Euronet Polska Spolka z.o.o. and Euronet Services
spol. s.r.o. ("Euronet") alleging that certain rules affecting ATM access fees
in Poland, the Czech Republic and Greece by Visa and Mastercard, and certain
of their subsidiaries, breach various competition laws. Euronet seeks damages,
costs and injunctive relief to prevent the defendants from enforcing these
rules. A trial has been scheduled for October 2023.

U.S. Liability Shift Litigation

In March 2016, a proposed U.S. merchant class action complaint was filed in
federal court in California alleging that Mastercard, Visa, American Express
and Discover (the "Network Defendants"), EMVCo, and a number of issuing banks
(the "Bank Defendants") engaged in a conspiracy to shift fraud liability for
card present transactions from issuing banks to merchants not yet in
compliance with the standards for EMV chip cards in the United States (the
"EMV Liability Shift"), in violation of the Sherman Act and California law.
Plaintiffs allege damages equal to the value of all chargebacks for which
class members became liable as a result of the EMV Liability Shift on October
1, 2015. The plaintiffs seek treble damages, attorney's fees and costs and an
injunction against future violations of governing law, and the defendants
filed a motion to dismiss. In September 2016, the district court denied the
Network Defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint, but granted such a motion
for EMVCo and the Bank Defendants. In May 2017, the district court transferred
the case to New York so that discovery could be coordinated with the U.S.
merchant class interchange litigation described above. In August 2020, the
district court issued an order granting the plaintiffs' request for class
certification and in January 2021, the Network Defendants' request for
permission to appeal that decision was denied. The plaintiffs have submitted
expert reports that allege aggregate damages in excess of $1 billion against
the four Network Defendants. The Network Defendants have submitted expert
reports rebutting both liability and damages. Briefing on summary judgment is
scheduled to conclude in July 2023.

Telephone Consumer Protection Class Action

Mastercard is a defendant in a Telephone Consumer Protection Act ("TCPA")
class action pending in Florida. The plaintiffs are individuals and businesses
who allege that approximately 381,000 unsolicited faxes were sent to them
advertising a Mastercard co-brand card issued by First Arkansas Bank ("FAB").
The TCPA provides for uncapped statutory damages of $500 per fax. Mastercard
has asserted various defenses to the claims, and has notified FAB of an
indemnity claim that it has (which FAB has disputed). In December 2019, the
Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") issued a declaratory ruling
clarifying that the TCPA does not apply to faxes sent to online fax services
that are received online via email. In December 2021, the trial court granted
plaintiffs' request for class certification, but narrowed the scope of the
class to stand alone fax recipients only. Mastercard's request to appeal that
decision was denied.

U.S. Federal Trade Commission Investigation

In June 2020, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Competition
("FTC") informed Mastercard that it has initiated a formal investigation into
compliance with the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act. In particular, the investigation focused on
Mastercard's compliance with the debit routing provisions of the Durbin
Amendment. In December 2022, the FTC voted to issue an administrative
complaint and accept a consent agreement with Mastercard. Pursuant to this
agreement, Mastercard agreed to provide primary account numbers (PANs) so that
merchants can route tokenized online debit transactions to alternative
networks. The consent agreement does not include any monetary penalty. The
consent agreement is currently undergoing a comment period, after which the
FTC will decide whether to make the proposed consent agreement final.

U.K. Prepaid Cards Matter

In 2019, Mastercard was informed by the U.K. Payment Systems Regulator ("PSR")
that Mastercard was a target of its investigation into alleged anti-
competitive conduct by public sector prepaid card program managers in the U.K.
This matter focused exclusively on historic behavior. In March 2021, the PSR
announced the resolution and settlement of this investigation. As part of the
resolution, Mastercard agreed to pay a maximum fine of £32 million. This
matter has no prospective impact on Mastercard's on-going business. In
connection with this matter, in the fourth quarter of 2020, Mastercard
recorded a litigation charge of $45 million. Mastercard paid the agreed fine
in March 2022.

Note 22. Settlement and Other Risk Management

Mastercard's rules guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions
between its customers ("settlement risk"). Settlement exposure is the
settlement risk to customers under Mastercard's rules due to the difference in
timing between the payment transaction date and subsequent settlement. For
those transactions the Company guarantees, the guarantee will cover the full
amount of the settlement obligation to the extent the settlement obligation is
not otherwise satisfied. Settlement is generally completed on a same-day
basis, however, in some circumstances, funds may not settle until subsequent
business days creating a short-term settlement exposure.

Gross settlement exposure is estimated using the average daily payment volume
during the three months prior to period end multiplied by the estimated number
of days of exposure. The Company has global risk management policies and
procedures, which include risk standards, to provide a framework for managing
the Company's settlement risk and exposure. In the event of failed settlement
by a customer, Mastercard may pursue one or more remedies available under the
Company's rules to recover potential losses. Historically, the Company has
experienced a low level of losses from customer settlement failures.

As part of its policies, Mastercard requires certain customers that are not in
compliance with the Company's risk standards to enter into risk mitigation
arrangements, including cash collateral and/or other forms of credit
enhancement such as letters of credit and guarantees. This requirement is
based on a review of the individual risk circumstances for each customer.
Mastercard monitors its credit risk portfolio and the adequacy of its risk
mitigation arrangements on a regular basis. Additionally, from time to time,
the Company reviews its risk management methodology and standards. As such,
the amounts of estimated settlement exposure are revised as necessary.

The Company's estimated settlement exposure was as follows at December 31:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | 2022| | 2021  
| | (in millions)  
Gross settlement exposure| | $| 64,885 | | | $| 59,571 |  
Risk mitigation arrangements applied to settlement exposure| | (10,697)| | |
(7,710)|  
  
Net settlement exposure

| | $| 54,188 | | | $| 51,861 |  
  
Mastercard also provides guarantees to customers and certain other
counterparties indemnifying them from losses stemming from failures of third
parties to perform duties. This includes guarantees of Mastercard-branded
travelers cheques issued, but not yet cashed of $342 million and $361 million
at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, of which the Company has risk
mitigation arrangements for $273 million and $287 million at December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively. In addition, the Company enters into agreements in the
ordinary course of business under which the Company agrees to indemnify third
parties against damages, losses and expenses incurred in connection with legal
and other proceedings arising from relationships or transactions with the
Company. Certain indemnifications do not provide a stated maximum exposure. As
the extent of the Company's obligations under these agreements depends
entirely upon the occurrence of future events, the Company's potential future
liability under these agreements is not determinable. Historically, payments
made by the Company under these types of contractual arrangements have not
been material.

Note 23. Derivative and Hedging Instruments

The Company monitors and manages its foreign currency and interest rate
exposures as part of its overall risk management program which focuses on the
unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially
adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on its operating
results. A primary objective of the Company's risk management strategies is to
reduce the financial impact that may arise from volatility in foreign currency
exchange rates principally through the use of both foreign exchange derivative
contracts and foreign currency denominated debt. In addition, the Company may
enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the effects of
interest rate movements on the Company's aggregate liability portfolio,
including potential future debt issuances.

Cash Flow Hedges

The Company may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts, including
forwards and options, to manage the impact of foreign currency variability on
anticipated revenues and expenses, which fluctuate based on currencies other
than the functional currency of the entity. The objective of these hedging
activities is to reduce the effect of movement in foreign exchange rates for a
portion of revenues and expenses forecasted to occur. As these contracts are
designated as cash flow hedging instruments, gains and losses resulting from
changes in fair value of these contracts are deferred in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified to the consolidated
statement of operations when the underlying hedged transactions impact
earnings.

In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate derivative contracts to
manage the effects of interest rate movements on the Company's aggregate
liability portfolio, including potential future debt issuances, and designate
such derivatives as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedging relationship.
In 2019, the Company entered into treasury rate locks which are accounted for
as cash flow hedges. In the first quarter of 2020, in connection with the
issuance of the 2020 USD Notes, these contracts were settled at a loss of $136
million, after tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). As of
December 31, 2022, a cumulative loss of $123 million, after tax, remains in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with these contracts
and will be reclassified as an adjustment to interest expense over the
respective terms of the 2020 USD Notes due in March 2030 and March 2050.

Fair Value Hedges

The Company may enter into interest rate derivative contracts, including
interest rate swaps, to manage the effects of interest rate movements on the
fair value of the Company's fixed-rate debt and designate such derivatives as
hedging instruments in a fair value hedging relationship. Changes in fair
value of these contracts and changes in fair value of fixed-rate debt
attributable to changes in the hedged benchmark interest rate generally offset
each other and are recorded in interest expense on the consolidated statement
of operations. Gains or losses related to the net settlements of interest rate
swaps are also recorded in interest expense on the consolidated statement of
operations. The periodic cash settlements are included in operating activities
on the consolidated statement of cash flows.

During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company entered into an interest rate
swap designated as a fair value hedge related to $1.0 billion of the 3.850%
Senior Notes due March 2050. In effect, the interest rate swap synthetically
converts the fixed interest rate on this debt to a variable interest rate
based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") Overnight Index Swap
Rate. The net impact to interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2022
and 2021 was not material.

Net Investment Hedges

The Company may use foreign currency denominated debt and/or foreign exchange
derivative contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in foreign
subsidiaries against adverse movements in exchange rates. The effective
portion of the net investment hedge is recorded as a currency translation
adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Forward points
are designated as an excluded component and recognized in general and
administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations over the
hedge period. The amounts recognized in earnings related to forward points for
2022 and 2021 were not material.

In 2015 and 2022, the Company designated its €1,650 million and €750 million
euro-denominated debt, respectively, as hedges of a portion of its net
investment in its European operations. In 2022, €700 million of the 2015 euro-
denominated debt matured and was de-designated as a net investment hedge.
During 2022, 2021 and 2020 the Company recorded a pre-tax net foreign currency
gain of $176 million, gain of $155 million and loss of $177 million,
respectively, in other comprehensive income (loss).

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had net foreign currency gains
of $309 million and $34 million, after tax, respectively, in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) associated with this hedging activity.

Non-designated Derivatives

The Company may also enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to serve
as economic hedges, such as to offset possible changes in the value of
monetary assets and liabilities due to foreign exchange fluctuations, without
designating these derivative contracts as hedging instruments. In addition,
the Company is subject to foreign exchange risk as part of its daily
settlement activities. This risk is typically limited to a few days between
when a payment transaction takes place and the subsequent settlement with
customers. To manage this risk, the Company may enter into short duration
foreign exchange derivative contracts based upon anticipated receipts and
disbursements for the respective currency position. The objective of these
activities is to reduce the Company's exposure to volatility arising from
gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against its
functional currencies. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value
of these contracts are recorded in general and administrative expenses on the
consolidated statement of operations, net, along with the foreign currency
gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities.

The following table summarizes the fair value of the Company's derivative
financial instruments and the related notional amounts:

The Company's derivative financial instruments are subject to both market and
counterparty credit risk. Market risk is the potential for economic losses to
be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes
in market factors such as foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and
other related variables. Counterparty credit risk is the risk of loss due to
failure of the counterparty to perform its obligations in accordance with
contractual terms. The Company's derivative contracts are subject to
enforceable master netting arrangements, which contain various netting and
setoff provisions. To mitigate counterparty credit risk, the Company enters
into derivative contracts with a diversified group of selected financial
institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. Generally, the
Company does not obtain collateral related to derivatives because of the high
credit ratings of the counterparties.

Note 24. Segment Reporting

Mastercard has concluded it has one reportable operating segment, "Payment
Solutions." Mastercard's Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the
chief operating decision-maker. All of the Company's activities are
interrelated, and each activity is dependent upon and supportive of the other.
Accordingly, all significant operating decisions are based upon analysis of
Mastercard at the consolidated level.

Revenue by geographic market is based on the location of the Company's
customer that issued the card, the location of the merchant acquirer where the
card is being used or the location of the customer receiving services. Revenue
generated in the U.S. was approximately 33% of net revenue in 2022, 32% in
2021 and 33% in 2020. No individual country, other than the U.S., generated
more than 10% of net revenue in those periods. Mastercard did not have any
individual customer that generated greater than 10% of net revenue in 2022,
2021 or 2020.
