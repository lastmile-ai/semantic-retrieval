Overview

JPMorgan Chase & Co. ("JPMorgan Chase" or the "Firm", NYSE: JPM), a financial
holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading
financial services firm based in the United States of America ("U.S."), with
operations worldwide. JPMorgan Chase had $3.7 trillion in assets and $292.3
billion in stockholders' equity as of December 31, 2022. The Firm is a leader
in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses,
commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management.
Under the J.P. Morgan and Chase brands, the Firm serves millions of customers,
predominantly in the U.S., and many of the world's most prominent corporate,
institutional and government clients globally.

JPMorgan Chase's principal bank subsidiary is JPMorgan Chase Bank, National
Association ("JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A."), a national banking association with
U.S. branches in 48 states and Washington, D.C. JPMorgan Chase's principal
non-bank subsidiary is J.P. Morgan Securities LLC ("J.P. Morgan Securities"),
a U.S. broker-dealer. The bank and non-bank subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase
operate nationally as well as through overseas branches and subsidiaries,
representative offices and subsidiary foreign banks. The Firm's principal
operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. are J.P. Morgan Securities plc and
J.P. Morgan SE ("JPMSE"), which are subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
and are based in the United Kingdom ("U.K.") and Germany, respectively.

The Firm's website is www.jpmorganchase.com. JPMorgan Chase makes available on
its website, free of charge, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on
Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section
15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as soon as reasonably
practicable after it electronically files or furnishes such material to the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") at www.sec.gov. JPMorgan
Chase makes new and important information about the Firm available on its
website at https://www.jpmorganchase.com, including on the Investor Relations
section of its website at https://www.jpmorganchase.com/ir. Information on the
Firm's website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 ("2022 Form 10-K" or "Form
10-K") or the Firm's other filings with the SEC. The Firm has adopted, and
posted on its website, a Code of Conduct for all employees of the Firm and a
Code of Ethics for its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial
Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and all other professionals of the Firm
worldwide serving in a finance, accounting, treasury, tax or investor
relations role. The Code of Ethics is also available in print upon request to
the Firm's Investor Relations team. Within the time period required by the
SEC, JPMorgan Chase will post on its website any amendment to the Code of
Ethics and any waiver applicable to a director or executive officer.

  

Business segments

For management reporting purposes, JPMorgan Chase's activities are organized
into four major reportable business segments, as well as a Corporate segment.
The Firm's consumer business is the Consumer & Community Banking ("CCB")
segment. The Firm's wholesale business segments are the Corporate & Investment
Bank ("CIB"), Commercial Banking ("CB"), and Asset & Wealth Management
("AWM").

A description of the Firm's business segments and the products and services
they provide to their respective client bases is provided in the "Business
segment results" section of Management's discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations ("Management's discussion and analysis" or
"MD&A"), beginning on page 46 and in Note 32.

Competition

JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries and affiliates operate in highly
competitive environments. Competitors include other banks, brokerage firms,
investment banking companies, merchant banks, hedge funds, commodity trading
companies, private equity firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies,
investment managers, credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, trust
companies, securities processing companies, automobile financing companies,
leasing companies, e-commerce and other internet-based companies, financial
technology companies, and other companies engaged in providing similar as well
as new products and services. The Firm's businesses generally compete on the
basis of the quality and variety of the Firm's products and services,
transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Competition also
varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies
served. With respect to some of its geographies and products, JPMorgan Chase
competes globally; with respect to others, the Firm competes on a national or
regional basis. New competitors in the financial services industry continue to
emerge, including firms that offer products and services solely through the
internet and non-financial companies that offer products and services that
disintermediate traditional banking products and services offered by financial
services firms such as JPMorgan Chase.

Firm culture

The foundations of JPMorgan Chase's culture are its core values and How We Do
Business Principles, which are fundamental to the Firm's success and are
represented by four central corporate tenets: exceptional client service;
operational excellence; a commitment to integrity, fairness and
responsibility; and cultivation of a great team and winning culture. The Firm
maintains its focus on its culture of inclusion and respect, which is
reinforced by its Code of Conduct and by increasing employee awareness,
education, communication and training. An important part of these efforts
includes the Firm's Business Resource Groups, which are groups of employees
who support JPMorgan Chase's diversity, equity and inclusion strategies by
leveraging the unique perspectives of their members. The Firm has global
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion centers of excellence that lead the Firm's
strategy in supporting its commitments to create more equity and lasting
impact in communities, and strengthen its inclusive culture.

Attracting and retaining employees

The goal of JPMorgan Chase's recruitment efforts is to attract and hire
talented individuals in all roles and at all career levels. The Firm strives
to provide both external candidates and internal employees who are seeking a
different role with challenging and stimulating career opportunities. These
opportunities range from internship training programs for students to entry-
level, management and executive careers. During 2022, approximately two-thirds
of the Firm's employment opportunities were filled by external candidates,
with the remainder filled by existing employees. In addition, depending on
business needs, and where appropriate, the Firm has implemented hybrid work
models which include a mix of on-site and remote work for certain roles.

Diversity is an important area of focus throughout the Firm's hiring process.
JPMorgan Chase engages in efforts aimed at hiring diverse talent, including
initiatives focused on gender, underrepresented ethnic groups, LGBTQ+
individuals, people with disabilities, veterans and others. The Firm's global
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion centers of excellence seek to increase
representation of and advance career opportunities for talented diverse
individuals across the Firm through initiatives such as career coaching and
mentorship.

JPMorgan Chase offers a competitive fellowship program that seeks to attract
accomplished individuals who have taken a career break and wish to return to
the workforce. In addition, and where appropriate, the Firm's hiring practices
focus on the skills of a job candidate rather than degrees held.

Developing employees

JPMorgan Chase supports the professional development and career growth of its
employees. An onboarding training curriculum is required for new hires, which
covers, among other topics, compliance with the Firm's Code of Conduct and
information concerning Firm policies and standards,

including those relating to cybersecurity. In addition, the Firm offers
extensive training programs and educational resources to all employees,
covering a broad variety of topics such as leadership, change management,
analytical thinking, culture and conduct, diversity, equity and inclusion, and
risk and controls. Leadership Edge, the Firm's global leadership and
management development center of excellence, is focused on creating one
Firmwide leadership culture.

Compensation and benefits

The Firm provides market-competitive compensation and benefits programs.
JPMorgan Chase's compensation philosophy includes guiding principles that
drive compensation-related decisions across the Firm, and includes: pay-for-
performance practices designed to attract and retain top talent;
responsiveness and alignment with shareholder interests; and reinforcement of
the Firm's culture and How We Do Business Principles, including the
integration of risk, controls and conduct considerations. The Firm's
commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion for all employees includes
compensation review processes that seek to ensure that the Firm's employees
are paid equitably and competitively for the work they do.

The Firm also supports employees' well-being. JPMorgan Chase offers an
extensive benefits and wellness package to employees and their families,
including healthcare coverage, retirement benefits, life and disability
insurance, on-site health and wellness centers, counseling and resources
related to mental health, employee assistance programs, competitive vacation
and leave policies, backup child care arrangements, tuition reimbursement
programs, and financial coaching. In 2022, the Firm implemented or announced
enhancements to certain health and wellness benefits for U.S. employees,
including expanded medical plan coverage and paid time off policies related to
parental, critical caregiving and bereavement leaves.

Part I

Supervision and regulation

The Firm is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under U.S.
federal and state laws, as well as the applicable laws of the jurisdictions
outside the U.S. in which the Firm does business.

Financial holding company:

Consolidated supervision. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a bank holding company
("BHC") and a financial holding company ("FHC") under U.S. federal law, and is
subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and examination
by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal
Reserve"). The Federal Reserve acts as the supervisor of the consolidated
operations of BHCs. Certain of JPMorgan Chase's subsidiaries are also
regulated directly by additional authorities based on the activities or
licenses of those subsidiaries.

JPMorgan Chase's national bank subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., is
supervised and regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
("OCC") and, with respect to certain matters, by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the "FDIC").

JPMorgan Chase's U.S. broker-dealers are supervised and regulated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"). Subsidiaries of the Firm that engage in
certain futures-related and swaps-related activities are supervised and
regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC"). J.P. Morgan
Securities plc is a U.K.-based bank regulated by the U.K. Prudential
Regulation Authority (the "PRA") and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority
("FCA").

JPMSE is a Germany-based credit institution regulated by the European Central
Bank ("ECB") as well as the local regulators in each of the countries in which
it operates. The Firm's other non-U.S. subsidiaries are regulated by the
banking, securities, prudential and conduct regulatory authorities, as
applicable, in the countries in which they operate.

Permissible business activities. The Bank Holding Company Act restricts BHCs
from engaging in business activities other than the business of banking and
certain closely-related activities. FHCs are permitted to engage in a broader
range of financial activities. The Federal Reserve has the authority to limit
an FHC's ability to conduct otherwise permissible activities if the FHC or any
of its depository institution subsidiaries ceases to meet applicable
eligibility requirements. The Federal Reserve may also impose corrective
capital and/or managerial requirements on the FHC, and if deficiencies are
persistent, may require divestiture of the FHC's depository institutions. If
any depository institution controlled by an FHC fails to maintain a
satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve
must prohibit the FHC and its subsidiaries from engaging in any new activities
other than

those permissible for BHCs, or acquiring a company engaged in such activities.

Capital and liquidity requirements. The Federal Reserve establishes capital,
liquidity and leverage requirements for JPMorgan Chase that are generally
consistent with the international Basel III capital and liquidity framework
and evaluates the Firm's compliance with those requirements. The OCC
establishes similar requirements for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Certain of the
Firm's non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches are also subject to local capital
and liquidity requirements.

Banking supervisors globally continue to refine and enhance the Basel III
capital framework for financial institutions. U.S. banking regulators have
announced their support for the issuance of the Basel III reforms and are
considering how to appropriately apply such reforms in the U.S.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and Liquidity Risk Management
on pages 97-104.

Stress tests. As a large BHC, JPMorgan Chase is subject to supervisory stress
testing administered by the Federal Reserve as part of the Federal Reserve's
annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ("CCAR") framework. The Firm
must conduct annual company-run stress tests and must also submit an annual
capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of
separate stress tests designed by the Firm and the Federal Reserve. The
Federal Reserve uses the results under the severely adverse scenario from its
supervisory stress test to determine the Firm's Stress Capital Buffer ("SCB")
requirement for the coming year, which forms part of the Firm's applicable
capital buffers. The Firm is required to file its annual CCAR submission on
April 5, 2023. The Federal Reserve will notify the Firm of its indicative SCB
requirement by June 30, 2023 and final SCB requirement by August 31, 2023. The
Firm's final SCB requirement will become effective on October 1, 2023. The OCC
requires JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to perform separate, similar stress tests
annually. The Firm publishes each year the results of the annual stress tests
for the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. under the supervisory "severely
adverse" scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve and the OCC.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for more information
concerning the Firm's CCAR.

Enhanced prudential standards. As part of its mandate to identify and monitor
risks to the financial stability of the U.S. posed by large banking
organizations, the Financial Stability Oversight Council ("FSOC") recommends
prudential standards and reporting requirements to the Federal Reserve for
systemically important financial institutions ("SIFIs"), such as JPMorgan
Chase. The Federal Reserve has adopted several rules to implement those
heightened prudential standards, including rules relating to risk management
and corporate governance of subject BHCs. JPMorgan Chase is required under
these rules to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk

| | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

| |  
  
* * *

  

management standards, including oversight by the board of directors of risk
management activities.

Resolution and recovery. The Firm is required to maintain a comprehensive
recovery plan, updated annually, summarizing the actions it would take to
remain well-capitalized and well-funded in order to avoid failure in the case
of an adverse event. In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to
prepare and submit a recovery plan as directed by the OCC. The Firm is
required to submit periodically to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a plan for
resolution in the event of material distress or failure (a "resolution plan").
In 2019, the FDIC and Federal Reserve revised the regulations governing
resolution plan requirements, and on the basis of those revisions, the Firm's
resolution plan submissions will alternate between "targeted" and "full"
plans. The Firm's "targeted" resolution plan was filed on June 28, 2021, and
the Firm's next "full" resolution plan is due to be filed on or before July 1,
2023. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is also required to prepare and submit a
separate resolution plan as directed by the FDIC on or before December 1,
2023.

Certain of the Firm's non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches are also subject to
local resolution and recovery planning requirements.

Orderly liquidation authority. Certain financial companies, including JPMorgan
Chase and certain of its subsidiaries, can also be subjected to resolution
under an "orderly liquidation authority." The U.S. Treasury Secretary, in
consultation with the President of the United States, must first make certain
determinations concerning extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk,
and action must be recommended by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve. Absent
such actions, the Firm, as a BHC, would remain subject to resolution under the
Bankruptcy Code. The FDIC has issued a draft policy statement describing its
"single point of entry" strategy for resolution of SIFIs under the orderly
liquidation authority, which seeks to keep operating subsidiaries of a BHC
open and impose losses on shareholders and creditors of the BHC in
receivership according to their statutory order of priority.

Holding company as a source of strength. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is required to
serve as a source of financial strength for its depository institution
subsidiaries and to commit resources to support those subsidiaries, including
when directed to do so by the Federal Reserve.

Regulation of acquisitions. Acquisitions by BHCs and their banks are subject
to requirements, limitations and prohibitions established by law and by the
Federal Reserve and the OCC. For example, FHCs and BHCs are required to obtain
the approval of the Federal Reserve before they acquire more than 5% of the
voting shares of an unaffiliated bank. In addition, acquisitions by financial
companies are prohibited if, as a result of the acquisition, the total
liabilities of the financial company would exceed 10% of the total liabilities
of all financial companies. Furthermore, for certain acquisitions, the Firm
must

provide written notice to the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring direct or
indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company with over
$10 billion in assets that is engaged in activities that are "financial in
nature." Moreover, while FHCs may engage in a broader range of activities
(including acquisitions) than BHCs, the Federal Reserve has the authority to
limit an FHC's ability to conduct otherwise permissible acquisitions if the
FHC or any of its depository institution subsidiaries ceases to meet
applicable eligibility requirements.

  

Ongoing obligations. The Firm is subject to obligations under the terms of a
Deferred Prosecution Agreement entered into with the Department of Justice on
September 29, 2020 relating to precious metals and U.S. Treasuries markets
investigations as well as under a related order issued by the CFTC.

Subsidiary banks:

The activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the Firm's principal subsidiary
bank, are limited to those specifically authorized under the National Bank Act
and related interpretations of the OCC. The OCC has authority to bring an
enforcement action against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for unsafe or unsound
banking practices, which could include limiting JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s
ability to conduct otherwise permissible activities, or imposing corrective
capital or managerial requirements on the bank.

FDIC deposit insurance. The FDIC deposit insurance fund provides insurance
coverage for certain deposits and is funded through assessments on banks,
including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

FDIC powers upon a bank insolvency. Upon any insolvency of JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A., the FDIC could be appointed as conservator or receiver under the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The FDIC has broad powers to transfer assets
and liabilities without the approval of the institution's creditors.

Prompt corrective action. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
Improvement Act of 1991 requires the relevant federal banking regulator to
take "prompt corrective action" with respect to a depository institution if
that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. The Federal
Reserve is also authorized to take appropriate action against the parent BHC,
such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., based on the undercapitalized status of any bank
subsidiary. In certain instances, the BHC would be required to guarantee the
performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized
subsidiary.

OCC Heightened Standards. The OCC has established guidelines setting forth
heightened standards for large banks, including minimum standards for the
design and implementation of a risk governance framework for banks. Under
these standards, a bank's risk governance framework must ensure that the
bank's risk profile is easily distinguished and separate from that of its
parent BHC for risk management purposes. The bank's board or risk

committee is responsible for approving the bank's risk governance framework,
providing active oversight of the bank's risk-taking activities, and holding
management accountable for adhering to the risk governance framework.

Restrictions on transactions with affiliates. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and
its subsidiaries are subject to restrictions imposed by federal law on
extensions of credit to, investments in stock or securities of, and
derivatives, securities lending and certain other transactions with, JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and certain other affiliates. These restrictions prevent JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and other affiliates from borrowing from such subsidiaries unless
the loans are secured in specified amounts and comply with certain other
requirements.

Dividend restrictions. Federal law imposes limitations on the payment of
dividends by national banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Refer to Note
26 for the amount of dividends that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. could pay, at
January 1, 2023, to JPMorgan Chase without the approval of the banking
regulators. The OCC and the Federal Reserve also have authority to prohibit or
limit the payment of dividends of a bank subsidiary that they supervise if, in
the banking regulator's opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an
unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the bank.

Depositor preference. Under federal law, the claims of a receiver of an
insured depositary institution ("IDI") for administrative expense and the
claims of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities (including the FDIC and deposits
in non-U.S. branches that are dually payable in the U.S. and in a non-U.S.
branch) have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the
institution, including depositors in non-U.S. branches and public noteholders.

Consumer supervision and regulation. JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. are subject to supervision and regulation by the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau ("CFPB") with respect to federal consumer protection laws,
including laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of unfair,
deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or
provision of consumer financial products and services. The CFPB also has
jurisdiction over small business lending activities with respect to fair
lending and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. As part of its regulatory
oversight, the CFPB has authority to take enforcement actions against firms
that offer certain products and services to consumers using practices that are
deemed to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. In February 2023, the CFPB proposed
a rule that would significantly reduce and limit the late payment fees that
credit card issuers, including the Firm, would be permitted to charge to
customers. The Firm's consumer activities are also subject to regulation under
state statutes which are enforced by the Attorney General or empowered agency
of each state.

In the U.K., the Firm operates a retail bank through J.P. Morgan Europe
Limited ("JPMEL") and provides retail investment management services through
Nutmeg Saving

and Investment Limited ("Nutmeg"). JPMEL is regulated by the PRA, and both
JPMEL and Nutmeg are regulated by the FCA with respect to their conduct of
financial services in the U.K., including obligations relating to the fair
treatment of customers. JPMEL is also regulated by the U.K. Payment Systems
Regulator with respect to its operation and use of payment systems. In
addition, the retail businesses of JPMEL and Nutmeg are subject to U.K.
consumer-protection legislation.

Securities and broker-dealer regulation:

The Firm conducts securities underwriting, dealing and brokerage activities in
the U.S. through J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and other non-bank broker-dealer
subsidiaries, all of which are subject to regulations of the SEC, FINRA and
the New York Stock Exchange, among others. The Firm conducts similar
securities activities outside the U.S. subject to local regulatory
requirements. In the U.K., those activities are conducted by J.P. Morgan
Securities plc. Broker-dealers are subject to laws and regulations covering
all aspects of the securities business, including sales and trading practices,
securities offerings, publication of research reports, use of customer funds,
the financing of client purchases, capital structure, record-keeping and
retention, and the conduct of their directors, officers and employees. Refer
to Broker-dealer regulatory capital on page 96 for information concerning the
capital of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc.

Investment management regulation:

The Firm's asset and wealth management businesses are subject to significant
regulation in jurisdictions around the world relating to, among other things,
the safeguarding and management of client assets, offerings of funds and
marketing activities. Certain of the Firm's subsidiaries are registered with,
and subject to oversight by, the SEC as investment advisers and broker-
dealers. The Firm's registered investment advisers in the United States are
subject to the fiduciary and other obligations imposed under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 and applicable state and federal law. The Firm's bank
fiduciary activities are subject to supervision by the OCC.

Derivatives regulation:

The Firm is subject to comprehensive regulation of its derivatives businesses,
including regulations that impose capital and margin requirements, require
central clearing of standardized over-the-counter ("OTC") derivatives, mandate
that certain standardized OTC swaps be traded on regulated trading venues, and
provide for reporting of certain mandated information. JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc are registered
with the CFTC as "swap dealers". In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC are registered with the SEC as "security-based swap
dealers". As a result, these entities are subject to a comprehensive
regulatory framework applicable to their swap or security-based swap
activities, including capital requirements, rules requiring the
collateralization of uncleared swaps and security-based swaps, rules regarding

| | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

segregation of counterparty collateral, business conduct and documentation
standards, record-keeping and reporting obligations, and anti-fraud and anti-
manipulation requirements. Similar requirements have also been established
under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation ("EMIR") and the Markets
in Financial Instruments Directive ("MiFID II"), as implemented in the EU and
as adopted in the U.K.

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is also registered with the CFTC as a futures
commission merchant and is a member of the National Futures Association.

Data, privacy and cybersecurity regulation:

The Firm and its subsidiaries are subject to laws, rules and regulations
globally concerning data, including data protection, consumer protection,
privacy, cybersecurity and related matters. These laws, rules and regulations
are constantly evolving, subject to interpretation, remain a focus of
regulators globally, may be enforced by private parties or government bodies,
and will continue to have a significant impact on all of the Firm's businesses
and operations.

The Bank Secrecy Act and Economic Sanctions:

The Bank Secrecy Act ("BSA") requires all financial institutions, including
banks and securities broker-dealers, to establish a risk-based system of
internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the
financing of terrorism. The BSA includes a variety of record-keeping and
reporting requirements, as well as due diligence/know-your-customer
documentation requirements. The Firm is also subject to the regulations and
economic sanctions programs administered and enforced by the U.S. Treasury's
Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") and EU and U.K. authorities which
target entities or individuals that are, or are located in countries that are,
involved in activities including terrorism, hostilities, embezzlement or human
rights violations. The Firm is also subject to economic sanctions laws, rules
and regulations in other jurisdictions in which it operates, including those
that conflict with or prohibit a firm such as JPMorgan Chase from complying
with certain laws, rules and regulations to which it is otherwise subject.

Anti-Corruption:

The Firm is subject to laws and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal
payments to government officials and others in the jurisdictions in which it
operates, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K.
Bribery Act.

Compensation practices:

The Firm's compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal
Reserve, as well as other agencies. The Federal Reserve has jointly issued
guidance with the FDIC and the OCC that is designed to ensure that incentive
compensation paid by banking organizations does not encourage imprudent risk-
taking that threatens the organizations' safety and soundness. The Financial
Stability Board ("FSB") has also established standards covering compensation
principles for banks. The Firm's compensation practices are also subject to
regulation and oversight by regulators in other jurisdictions, notably the
Fifth Capital Requirements Directive ("CRD V"), as implemented in the EU and
as adopted in the U.K, which includes compensation-related provisions. The
European Banking Authority has instituted guidelines on compensation policies
including under CRD V which in certain countries, such as Germany, are
implemented or supplemented by local regulations or guidelines. The U.K.
regulators have also instituted guidelines on CRD V compensation policies. The
Firm expects that the implementation of regulatory guidelines regarding
compensation in the U.S. and other countries will continue to evolve, and may
affect the manner in which the Firm structures its compensation programs and
practices.

Other significant international regulatory initiatives:

Policymakers in the U.K. and EU continue to implement a program of regulatory
enhancements relating to financial services, several key elements of which are
discussed below.

MiFID II requires the trading of shares and certain standardized OTC
derivatives to take place on specified trading venues. MiFID II also
significantly enhanced requirements for pre- and post-trade transparency,
transaction reporting and investor protection, and introduced a position
limits and reporting regime for commodities. In November 2021, the European
Commission ("EC") published a draft legislative proposal for amendments to
MiFID II focused on changes to rules related to transparency and market
structure, including the proposed creation of a consolidated tape intended to
increase transparency into trading across the EU by providing a centralized
source of market data. This legislation remains subject to review by the
European Parliament and European Council.

In the U.K., MiFID II is being amended through the "Wholesale Markets Review",
a set of proposals designed to streamline and improve regulation of the U.K.
secondary markets following the U.K.'s departure from the EU. Some of the
changes, such as the removal of the requirement to execute trades in shares on
certain trading venues, have been introduced through the Financial Services
and Markets Bill ("FSMB"), which is expected to be passed by the U.K.
Parliament in the first half of 2023. Other changes, such as amendments to
MiFID II rules related to transparency, will be subject to further
consultation, which is expected during 2023.

In December 2022, the EC published a legislative proposal to amend EMIR to
increase the competitiveness of the EU central clearing framework and to
enhance supervision of EU central counterparties ("CCPs"). These proposals are
subject to further review by the European Parliament and European Council.

The EU has adopted mandatory buy-in rules under the Central Securities
Depositories Regulation ("CSDR") which will impose requirements relating to
sourcing of securities in the event of a settlement fail. In June 2022, EU
regulators proposed an amendment to postpone the application of these rules
until November 2025. The amendment remains subject to review by the European
Parliament and European Council.

In December 2022, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced an extensive
package of reforms to U.K. financial services regulation known as the
"Edinburgh Reforms". These reforms aim to drive growth and competitiveness in
the U.K. financial services sector following the U.K.'s departure from the EU.
The reform package includes initiatives relating to a number of areas of
financial services policy, including retail banks, payments, markets, digital
assets and sustainable finance. The U.K. Government and regulators are
expected to release further consultations and announcements related to these
reforms in 2023.

EU and U.K. regulators are expected to finalize the rules implementing the
Basel III framework during 2023. The Firm's banking entities in the EU and the
U.K. will be required to comply with the Basel III final rules by January
2025, allowing for certain transitional arrangements until 2030 and 2032,
respectively. The main changes implemented by the Basel III final rules will
be revisions to the credit risk and operational risk calculation methods to
reduce the use of and reliance on internal modelling approaches and introduce
internationally-agreed changes to the market risk framework. The EU Basel III
final rules also strengthen enforcement tools for supervisors overseeing EU
banks and require EU banking entities to systematically identify, disclose and
manage environmental, social and governance ("ESG") risks as part of their
risk management practices. In addition, in December 2022, the European Banking
Authority ("EBA") announced that it will publish rules and technical standards
between 2023 and 2025 related to sustainable finance, which will be applicable
to EU banks. The Firm's banking entities in the U.K. will be required to
comply with regulatory policies and standards related to climate risk being
developed by the PRA. In addition, EU legislation requires that certain non-EU
banks operating in the EU establish an intermediate parent undertaking ("IPU")
located in the EU. The IPU legislation allows a second IPU to be established
if a single IPU would conflict with "home country" bank separation rules or
impede resolvability. The Firm will be required to comply with the EU's IPU
requirements by December 30, 2023.

The Firm's banking entities in the EU and U.K. are also subject to supervisory
expectations published by the ECB

and the PRA, respectively, for management of financial risks arising from
climate change and the increasing operational reliance on IT systems, third-
party services and innovative technologies, as well as supervisory
expectations for operational resilience and resilience from macro-financial
and geopolitical shocks. These expectations address bank strategy, governance,
risk management, scenario analysis, risk reporting and disclosure.

Policymakers in the EU have continued to implement sustainability-related
initiatives. In December 2022, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting
Directive ("CSRD") was published in the Official Journal of the EU. The CSRD
will replace and significantly expand the scope and content of ESG reporting
requirements under the EU's existing ESG reporting rules. CSRD reporting
requirements will be phased in beginning in 2024. In addition, the EC
published its legislative proposal on the Corporate Sustainability Due
Diligence Directive ("CSDDD") in February 2022. The draft directive sets
mandatory due diligence obligations for companies to address actual and
potential human rights violations and environmental adverse impacts stemming
from their own operations and business relationships, including the activities
of companies with which they have established business relationships. The
proposed legislation may also require the adoption of company-specific
climate-related transition plans. The CSDDD is currently subject to review by
the European Parliament and European Council. Both the CSRD and CSDDD will
apply to certain of the Firm's EU entities as well as to certain non-EU
entities.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

The following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could
affect JPMorgan Chase's financial condition and operations. Readers should not
consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all
potential risks that could affect the Firm. Any of the risk factors discussed
below could by itself, or combined with other factors, materially and
adversely affect JPMorgan Chase's business, results of operations, financial
condition, capital position, liquidity, competitive position or reputation,
including by materially increasing expenses or decreasing revenues, which
could result in material losses or a decrease in earnings.

Summary

The principal risk factors that could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase's
business, results of operations, financial condition, capital position,
liquidity, competitive position or reputation include:

•Regulatory risks, including the impact that applicable laws, rules and
regulations in the highly-regulated and supervised financial services
industry, as well as changes to or in the application, interpretation or
enforcement of those laws, rules and regulations, can have on JPMorgan Chase's
business and operations; the ways in which differences in financial services
regulation in different jurisdictions or with respect to certain competitors
can negatively impact JPMorgan Chase's business; the penalties and collateral
consequences, and higher compliance and operational costs, that JPMorgan Chase
may incur when resolving a regulatory investigation; the ways in which less
predictable legal and regulatory frameworks in certain countries can
negatively impact JPMorgan Chase's operations and financial results; and the
losses that security holders will absorb if JPMorgan Chase were to enter into
a resolution.

•Political risks, including the potential negative effects on JPMorgan Chase's
businesses due to economic uncertainty or instability caused by political
developments.

•Market risks, including the effects that economic and market events and
conditions, governmental policies, changes in interest rates and credit
spreads, and market fluctuations can have on JPMorgan Chase's consumer and
wholesale businesses and its investment and market-making positions and on
JPMorgan Chase's earnings and its liquidity and capital levels.

•Credit risks, including potential negative effects from adverse changes in
the financial condition of clients, customers, counterparties, custodians and
central counterparties; and the potential for losses due to declines in the
value of collateral in stressed market conditions or from concentrations of
credit and market risk.

•Liquidity risks, including the risk that JPMorgan Chase's liquidity could be
impaired by market-wide

illiquidity or disruption, unforeseen liquidity or capital requirements, the
inability to sell assets, default by a significant market participant,
unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral, or lack of market or customer
confidence in JPMorgan Chase; the dependence of JPMorgan Chase & Co. on the
cash flows of its subsidiaries; the adverse effects that any downgrade in any
of JPMorgan Chase's credit ratings may have on its liquidity and cost of
funding; and potential negative impacts, including litigation risks,
associated with the transition to alternative reference rates.

•Capital risks, including the risk that any failure by or inability of
JPMorgan Chase to maintain the required level and composition of capital, or
unfavorable changes in applicable capital requirements, could limit JPMorgan
Chase's ability to distribute capital to shareholders or to support its
business activities.

•Operational risks, including risks associated with JPMorgan Chase's
dependence on its operational systems, its ability to maintain appropriately-
staffed workforces and the competence, integrity, health and safety of its
employees, as well as the systems and employees of third parties, market
participants and service providers; the potential negative effects of failing
to identify and address operational risks related to the introduction of or
changes to products, services and delivery platforms; legal and regulatory
risks related to safeguarding personal information; the harm that could be
caused by a successful cyber attack affecting JPMorgan Chase or by other
extraordinary events; risks associated with JPMorgan Chase's risk management
framework, its models and estimations and associated judgments used in its
stress testing and financial statements, and controls over disclosure and
financial reporting; and potential adverse effects of failing to comply with
heightened regulatory and other standards for the oversight of vendors and
other service providers.

•Strategic risks, including the damage to JPMorgan Chase's competitive
standing and results that could occur if management fails to develop and
execute effective business strategies; risks associated with the significant
and increasing competition that JPMorgan Chase faces; and the potential
adverse impacts of climate change on JPMorgan Chase's business operations,
clients and customers.

•Conduct risks, including the negative impact that can result from the actions
or misconduct of employees, including any failure of employees to conduct
themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase's expectations, policies and
practices.

•Reputation risks, including the potential adverse effects on JPMorgan Chase's
relationships with its clients, customers, shareholders, regulators and other
stakeholders that could arise from employee misconduct, security breaches,
inadequate risk

management, compliance or operational failures, litigation and regulatory
investigations, failure to satisfy expectations concerning environmental,
social and governance concerns, failure to effectively manage conflicts of
interest or to satisfy fiduciary obligations, or other factors that could
damage JPMorgan Chase's reputation.

•Country risks, including potential impacts on JPMorgan Chase's businesses
from an outbreak or escalation of hostilities between countries or within a
country or region; and the potential adverse effects of local economic,
political, regulatory and social factors on JPMorgan Chase's business and
revenues in certain countries.

•People risks, including the criticality of attracting and retaining qualified
and diverse employees; and the potential adverse effects of unfavorable
changes in immigration or travel policies on JPMorgan Chase's workforce.

•Legal risks, including those relating to litigation and regulatory and
government investigations.

The above summary is subject in its entirety to the discussion of the risk
factors set forth below.

  

Regulatory

JPMorgan Chase's businesses are highly regulated, and the laws, rules and
regulations that apply to JPMorgan Chase have a significant impact on its
business and operations.

JPMorgan Chase is a financial services firm with operations worldwide.
JPMorgan Chase must comply with the laws, rules and regulations that apply to
its operations in all of the jurisdictions around the world in which it does
business, and financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase are subject to
extensive regulation and supervision.

The regulation and supervision of JPMorgan Chase significantly affects the way
that it conducts its business and structures its operations, and JPMorgan
Chase could be required to make changes to its business and operations in
response to supervisory expectations or decisions or to new or changed laws,
rules and regulations. These types of developments could result in JPMorgan
Chase incurring additional costs in connection with complying with applicable
laws, rules and regulations, which could reduce its profitability.
Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase's entry into or acquisition of a new business or
an increase in its principal investments may require JPMorgan Chase to comply
with additional laws, rules, and regulations.

In response to new and existing laws, rules and regulations and expanded
supervision, JPMorgan Chase has in the past been and could in the future be,
required to:

•limit the products and services that it offers

•reduce the liquidity that it can provide through its market-making activities

•refrain from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise
pursue

•pay higher taxes (including as part of any minimum global tax regime),
assessments, levies or other governmental charges, including in connection
with the resolution of tax examinations

•incur losses, including with respect to fraudulent transactions perpetrated
against its customers

•dispose of certain assets, and do so at times or prices that are
disadvantageous

•impose restrictions on certain business activities, or

•increase the prices that it charges for products and services, which could
reduce the demand for them.

Any failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with the laws, rules and regulations
to which it is subject could result in:

•increased regulatory and supervisory scrutiny

•regulatory and governmental enforcement actions

•the imposition of fines, penalties or other sanctions

•increased exposure to litigation, or

•harm to its reputation.

Differences and inconsistencies in financial services regulation can
negatively impact JPMorgan Chase's businesses, operations and financial
results.

The content and application of laws, rules and regulations affecting financial
services firms sometimes vary according to factors such as the size of the
firm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates, and other
criteria. For example:

•larger firms such as JPMorgan Chase are often subject to more stringent
supervision, regulation and regulatory scrutiny

•financial technology companies and other non-traditional competitors may not
be subject to banking regulation, or may be supervised by a national or state
regulatory agency that does not have the same resources or regulatory
priorities as the regulatory agencies which supervise more diversified
financial services firms, or

•the financial services regulatory framework in a particular jurisdiction may
favor financial institutions that are based in that jurisdiction.

These types of differences in the regulatory framework can result in JPMorgan
Chase losing market share to competitors that are less regulated or not
subject to regulation, especially with respect to unregulated financial
products.

There can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory
initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the
U.S. and in other countries and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business.
For

example, when adopting rules that are intended to implement a global
regulatory standard, a national regulator may introduce additional or more
restrictive requirements, which can create competitive disadvantages for
financial services firms, such as JPMorgan Chase, that may be subject to those
enhanced regulations.

In addition, certain national and multi-national bodies and governmental
agencies outside the U.S. have adopted laws, rules or regulations that may
conflict with or prohibit JPMorgan Chase from complying with laws, rules and
regulations to which it is otherwise subject, creating conflict of law issues
that also increase its risks of non-compliance in those jurisdictions.

Legislative and regulatory initiatives outside the U.S. could require JPMorgan
Chase to make significant modifications to its operations and legal entity
structure in the relevant countries or regions in order to comply with those
requirements. These include laws, rules and regulations that have been adopted
or proposed relating to:

•the establishment of locally-based intermediate holding companies or
operating subsidiaries

•requirements to maintain minimum amounts of capital or liquidity in locally-
based subsidiaries

•to implement processes within locally-based subsidiaries to comply with local
regulatory requirements

•the separation (or "ring fencing") of core banking products and services from
markets activities

•the resolution of financial institutions

•requirements for executing or settling transactions on exchanges or through
central counterparties ("CCPs")

•position limits and reporting rules for derivatives

•governance and accountability regimes

•conduct of business and control requirements, and

•restrictions on compensation.

These types of differences, inconsistencies and conflicts in financial
services regulation have required and could in the future require JPMorgan
Chase to:

•divest assets or restructure its operations

•absorb increased capital and liquidity costs

•incur higher operational and compliance costs

•change the prices that it charges for its products and services

•curtail the products and services that it offers to its customers and clients

•curtail other business opportunities, including acquisitions or principal
investments, that it otherwise would have pursued

•become subject to regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, or

•incur higher costs for complying with different legal and regulatory
frameworks.

Any or all of these factors could harm JPMorgan Chase's ability to compete
against other firms that are not subject to the same laws, rules and
regulations or supervisory oversight, or harm JPMorgan Chase's businesses,
results of operations and profitability.

Resolving regulatory investigations can subject JPMorgan Chase to significant
penalties and collateral consequences, and could result in higher compliance
costs or restrictions on its operations.

JPMorgan Chase is subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny from regulatory
authorities in many jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase has paid significant fines,
provided other monetary relief, incurred other penalties and experienced other
repercussions in connection with resolving investigations and enforcement
actions by governmental agencies. JPMorgan Chase could become subject to
similar regulatory or governmental resolutions or other actions in the future,
and addressing the requirements of any such resolutions or actions could
result in JPMorgan Chase incurring higher operational and compliance costs,
including devoting substantial resources to the required remediation, or
needing to comply with other restrictions.

In connection with resolving specific regulatory investigations or enforcement
actions, certain regulators have required JPMorgan Chase and other financial
institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the activities that gave rise
to the resolution. These types of admissions can lead to:

•greater exposure in litigation

•damage to JPMorgan Chase's reputation

•disqualification from doing business with certain clients or customers, or in
specific jurisdictions, or

•other direct and indirect adverse effects.

Furthermore, U.S. government officials have demonstrated a willingness to
bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have required that
institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in
connection with resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement actions.
Resolutions of this type can have significant collateral consequences for the
subject financial institution, including:

•loss of clients, customers and business

•restrictions on offering certain products or services, and

•losing permission to operate certain businesses, either temporarily or
permanently.

JPMorgan Chase expects that:

•it and other financial services firms will continue to be subject to
heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement
actions

•governmental authorities will continue to require that financial institutions
be penalized for actual or deemed violations of law with formal and punitive
enforcement actions, including the imposition of significant monetary and
other sanctions, rather than resolving these matters through informal
supervisory actions; and

•governmental authorities will be more likely to pursue formal enforcement
actions and resolutions against JPMorgan Chase to the extent that it has
previously been subject to other governmental investigations or enforcement
actions.

If JPMorgan Chase fails to meet the requirements of any resolution of a
governmental investigation or enforcement action, or to maintain risk and
control processes that meet the heightened standards and expectations of its
regulators, it could be required to, among other things:

•enter into further resolutions of investigations or enforcement actions

•pay additional regulatory penalties or enter into judgments, or

•accept material regulatory restrictions on, or changes in the management of,
its businesses.

In these circumstances, JPMorgan Chase could also become subject to other
sanctions, or to prosecution or civil litigation with respect to the conduct
that gave rise to an investigation or enforcement action.

JPMorgan Chase's operations and financial results can be negatively impacted
in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks.

JPMorgan Chase conducts existing and new business in certain countries in
which the application of the rule of law is inconsistent or less predictable,
including with respect to:

•the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in
specific types of business or transactions

•conflicting or ambiguous laws, rules and regulations, or the inconsistent
application or interpretation of existing laws, rules and regulations

•uncertainty concerning the enforceability of contractual, intellectual
property or other obligations

•difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or
protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or
where graft or corruption may be pervasive

•the threat of regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal
prosecutions that are arbitrary or otherwise contrary to established legal
principles in other parts of the world, and

•the termination of licenses required to operate in the local market or the
suspension of business relationships with governmental bodies.

If the application of the laws, rules and regulations in any country is
susceptible to producing inconsistent or unexpected outcomes, this can create
a more difficult environment in which JPMorgan Chase conducts its business and
could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase's operations and reduce its earnings
with respect to that country. For example, conducting business could require
JPMorgan Chase to devote significant additional resources to understanding,
and monitoring changes in, local laws, rules and regulations, as well as
structuring its operations to comply with local laws, rules and regulations
and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures.

There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will always be successful in its
efforts to fully understand and to conduct its business in compliance with the
laws, rules and regulations of all of the jurisdictions in which it operates,
and the risk of non-compliance can be greater in countries that have less
predictable legal and regulatory frameworks.

Requirements for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan Chase could result in
JPMorgan Chase having to restructure or reorganize its businesses and could
increase its funding or operational costs or curtail its businesses.

JPMorgan Chase is required under Federal Reserve and FDIC rules to prepare and
submit periodically to those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly
resolution in bankruptcy, without extraordinary government support, in the
event of material financial distress or failure. The agencies' evaluation of
JPMorgan Chase's resolution plan may change, and the requirements for
resolution plans may be modified from time to time. Any such determinations or
modifications could result in JPMorgan Chase needing to make changes to its
legal entity structure or to certain internal or external activities, which
could increase its funding or operational costs, or hamper its ability to
serve clients and customers.

If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were both to determine that a resolution
plan submitted by JPMorgan Chase has deficiencies, they could jointly impose
more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on
JPMorgan Chase's growth, activities or operations. The agencies could also
require that JPMorgan Chase restructure, reorganize or divest assets or
businesses in ways that could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase's
operations and strategy.

Holders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s debt and equity securities will absorb
losses if it were to enter into a resolution.

Federal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase & Co. (the "Parent Company")
maintain minimum levels of unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-

| | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
  
12

| |  
  
* * *

  

absorbing capacity with specific terms ("eligible LTD") for purposes of
recapitalizing JPMorgan Chase's operating subsidiaries if the Parent Company
were to enter into a resolution either:

•in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or

•in a receivership administered by the FDIC under Title II of the Dodd-Frank
Act ("Title II").

If the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution, holders of eligible LTD
and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company will absorb the
losses of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries.

The preferred "single point of entry" strategy under JPMorgan Chase's
resolution plan contemplates that only the Parent Company would enter
bankruptcy proceedings. JPMorgan Chase's subsidiaries would be recapitalized,
as needed, so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be
divested or wound down in an orderly manner. As a result, the Parent Company's
losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on
holders of the Parent Company's equity securities and thereafter on its
unsecured creditors, including holders of eligible LTD and other debt
securities. Claims of holders of those securities would have a junior position
to the claims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase's subsidiaries and to the claims
of priority (as determined by statute) and secured creditors of the Parent
Company.

Accordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in bankruptcy, holders of
eligible LTD and other debt securities of the Parent Company would realize
value only to the extent available to the Parent Company as a shareholder of
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other subsidiaries, and only after any
claims of priority and secured creditors of the Parent Company have been fully
repaid.

The FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization
model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important
financial institution, such as the Parent Company, under Title II. However,
the FDIC has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy.

If the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into, a resolution, none of
the Parent Company, the Federal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow
JPMorgan Chase's preferred resolution strategy, and losses to holders of
eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company, under
whatever strategy is ultimately followed, could be greater than they might
have been under JPMorgan Chase's preferred strategy.

Political

Economic uncertainty or instability caused by political developments can
negatively impact JPMorgan Chase's businesses.

Political developments in the U.S. and other countries can cause uncertainty
in the economic environment and market conditions in which JPMorgan Chase
operates its businesses. Certain governmental policy initiatives, as well as
heightened geopolitical tensions, could significantly affect U.S. and global
economic growth and cause higher volatility in the financial markets,
including:

•monetary policies and actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other central
banks or governmental authorities, including any sustained large-scale asset
purchases or any suspension or reversal of those actions

•fiscal policies, including with respect to taxation and spending

•actions that governments take or fail to take in response to the effects of
health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics,
as well as the effectiveness of any actions taken

•governmental actions or initiatives relating to climate risk, or more
generally, the impact of business activities on environmental, social and
governance ("ESG") matters, and the management of climate and ESG-related
risks

•isolationist foreign policies

•an outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or other geopolitical instabilities

•economic or financial sanctions

•the implementation of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies, or

•other governmental policies or actions adopted or taken in response to
political or social pressures.

These types of political developments, and uncertainty about the possible
outcomes of these developments, could:

•erode investor confidence in the U.S. economy and financial markets, which
could potentially undermine the status of the U.S. dollar as a safe haven
currency

•provoke retaliatory countermeasures by other countries and otherwise heighten
tensions in regulatory, enforcement or diplomatic relations

•lead to the withdrawal of government support for agencies and enterprises
such as the U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association and the U.S. Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (together, the "U.S. GSEs")

•increase concerns about whether the U.S. government will be funded, and its
outstanding debt serviced, at any particular time

Part I

•result in periodic shutdowns of the U.S. government or governments in other
countries

•increase investor reliance on actions by the Federal Reserve or other central
banks, or influence investor perceptions concerning government support of
sectors of the economy or the economy as a whole

•adversely affect the financial condition or credit ratings of clients and
counterparties with which JPMorgan Chase does business, or

•cause JPMorgan Chase to refrain from engaging in business opportunities that
it might otherwise pursue.

These factors could lead to:

•slower growth rates, rising inflation or recession

•greater market volatility

•a contraction of available credit and the widening of credit spreads

•erosion of adequate risk premium on certain financial assets

•diminished investor and consumer confidence

•lower investment growth

•large-scale sales of government debt and other debt and equity securities in
the U.S. and other countries

•reduced commercial activity among trading partners

•the potential for a currency redenomination by a particular country

•the possible departure of a country from, or the dissolution of, a political
or economic alliance or treaty

•potential expropriation or nationalization of assets, or

•other market dislocations, including the spread of unfavorable economic
conditions from a particular country or region to other countries or regions.

Any of these potential outcomes could cause JPMorgan Chase to suffer losses on
its market-making positions or in its investment portfolio, reduce its
liquidity and capital levels, increase the allowance for credit losses or lead
to higher net charge offs, hamper its ability to deliver products and services
to its clients and customers, and weaken its results of operations and
financial condition.

JPMorgan Chase's business and results of operations may also be adversely
affected by actions or initiatives by national, state or local governmental
authorities that:

•seek to discourage financial institutions from doing business with companies
engaged in certain industries, or conversely, to penalize financial
institutions that elect not to do business with such companies, or

•mandate specific business practices that companies operating in the relevant
jurisdiction must adopt.

Because governmental policies in one jurisdiction may differ or conflict with
those in other jurisdictions, JPMorgan Chase may face negative consequences
regardless of the course of action it takes or elects not to take, including:

•restrictions or prohibitions on doing business within a particular
jurisdiction, or with governmental entities in a jurisdiction

•the threat of enforcement actions, including under antitrust or other anti-
competition laws, rules and regulations, and

•harm to its reputation arising from public criticism, including from
politicians, activists and other stakeholders.

In addition, JPMorgan Chase's relationships or ability to transact with
clients and customers, and with governmental or regulatory bodies in
jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase does business, could be adversely
affected if its decisions with respect to doing business with companies in
certain sensitive industries are perceived to harm those companies or to align
with particular political viewpoints. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase's
participation in or association with certain social and environmental industry
groups or initiatives could be viewed by activists or governmental authorities
as boycotting or other discriminatory business behavior.

Market

Economic and market events and conditions can materially affect JPMorgan
Chase's businesses and investment and market-making positions.

JPMorgan Chase's results of operations can be negatively affected by adverse
changes in any of the following:

•investor, consumer and business sentiment

•events that reduce confidence in the financial markets

•inflation, deflation or recession

•high unemployment or, conversely, a tightening labor market

•the availability and cost of capital, liquidity and credit

•levels and volatility of interest rates, credit spreads and market prices for
currencies, equities and commodities, and the duration of any changes in
levels or volatility

•the economic effects of an outbreak or escalation of hostilities, terrorism
or other geopolitical instabilities, cyber attacks, climate change, natural
disasters, severe weather conditions, health emergencies, the spread of
infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics or other extraordinary events
beyond JPMorgan Chase's control, and

•the strength of the U.S. and global economies.

All of these are affected by global economic, market and political events and
conditions, as well as regulatory restrictions.

---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

| |  
  
* * *

  

In addition, JPMorgan Chase's investment portfolio and market-making
businesses can suffer losses due to unanticipated market events, including:

•severe declines in asset values

•unexpected credit events

•unforeseen events or conditions that may cause previously uncorrelated
factors to become correlated (and vice versa)

•the inability to effectively hedge market and other risks related to market-
making and investment portfolio positions, or

•other market risks that may not have been appropriately taken into account in
the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument.

If JPMorgan Chase experiences significant losses in its investment portfolio
or from market-making activities, this could reduce JPMorgan Chase's
profitability and its liquidity and capital levels, and thereby constrain the
growth of its businesses.

JPMorgan Chase's consumer businesses can be negatively affected by adverse
economic conditions and governmental policies.

JPMorgan Chase's consumer businesses are particularly affected by U.S. and
global economic conditions, including:

•personal and household income distribution

•unemployment or underemployment

•prolonged periods of exceptionally low or high interest rates

•housing prices

•the level of inflation and its effect on prices for goods and services

•consumer and small business confidence levels, and

•changes in consumer spending or in the level of consumer debt.

Heightened levels of unemployment or underemployment that result in reduced
personal and household income could negatively affect consumer credit
performance to the extent that consumers are less able to service their debts.
In addition, sustained low growth, low or negative interest rates,
inflationary pressures or recessionary conditions could diminish customer
demand for the products and services offered by JPMorgan Chase's consumer
businesses.

Adverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in delinquencies,
additions to the allowance for credit losses and higher net charge-offs, which
can reduce JPMorgan Chase's earnings. These consequences could be
significantly worse in certain geographies and industry segments where
declining industrial or manufacturing activity has resulted in or could result
in higher levels of unemployment, or where high levels of consumer debt, such
as outstanding

student loans, could impair the ability of customers to pay their other
consumer loan obligations.

JPMorgan Chase's earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely
affected by governmental policies and actions that affect consumers,
including:

•policies and initiatives relating to medical insurance, education,
immigration, employment status and housing, and

•policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as higher taxes and
increased regulation which could result in reductions in consumer disposable
income.

Unfavorable market and economic conditions can have an adverse effect on
JPMorgan Chase's wholesale businesses.

In JPMorgan Chase's wholesale businesses, market and economic factors can
affect the volume of transactions that JPMorgan Chase executes for its clients
or for which it advises clients, and, therefore, the revenue that JPMorgan
Chase receives from those transactions. These factors can also influence the
willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in
capital markets transactions that JPMorgan Chase manages, such as loan
syndications or securities underwriting. Furthermore, if a significant and
sustained deterioration in market conditions were to occur, the profitability
of JPMorgan Chase's capital markets businesses, including its loan
syndication, securities underwriting and leveraged lending activities, could
be reduced to the extent that those businesses:

•earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction volumes, including when
clients are unwilling or unable to refinance their outstanding debt
obligations in unfavorable market conditions, or

•dispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss, or hold larger residual
positions in credit commitments that cannot be sold at favorable prices.

An adverse change in market conditions in particular segments of the economy,
such as a sudden and severe downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in
commodity prices, or sustained changes in consumer behavior that affect
specific economic sectors, could have a material adverse effect on clients of
JPMorgan Chase whose operations or financial condition are directly or
indirectly dependent on the health or stability of those market segments or
economic sectors, as well as clients that are engaged in related businesses.
JPMorgan Chase could incur credit losses on its loans and other credit
commitments to clients that operate in, or are dependent on, any sector of the
economy that is under stress.

The fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing client assets or holding
assets under custody for clients could be diminished by declining asset values
or other adverse macroeconomic conditions. For example, higher interest rates
or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of client
assets that JPMorgan Chase manages or

| | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| |

15  
  
* * *

Part I

holds under custody, which, in turn, could affect JPMorgan Chase's revenue
from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody.
Similarly, adverse macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt outflows
from JPMorgan Chase funds or accounts, or cause clients to invest in products
that generate lower revenue. Substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a
JPMorgan Chase fund can also hamper the investment performance of the fund,
particularly if the outflows create the need for the fund to dispose of fund
assets at disadvantageous times or prices, and could lead to further
withdrawals based on the weaker investment performance.

An economic downturn or sustained changes in consumer behavior that results in
shifts in consumer and business spending could also have a negative impact on
certain of JPMorgan Chase's wholesale clients, and thereby diminish JPMorgan
Chase's earnings from its wholesale operations. For example, the businesses of
certain of JPMorgan Chase's wholesale clients are dependent on consistent
streams of rental income from commercial real estate properties which are
owned or being built by those clients. Sustained adverse economic conditions
could result in reductions in the rental cash flows that owners or developers
receive from their tenants which, in turn, could depress the values of the
properties and impair the ability of borrowers to service or refinance their
commercial real estate loans. These consequences could result in JPMorgan
Chase experiencing increases in the allowance for credit losses, higher
delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs within its commercial real estate loan
portfolio and incurring higher costs for servicing a larger volume of
delinquent loans in that portfolio, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase's earnings
from its wholesale businesses.

Changes in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely affect JPMorgan
Chase's earnings, its liquidity or its capital levels.

When interest rates are high or increasing, JPMorgan Chase can generally be
expected to earn higher net interest income. However, higher interest rates
can also lead to:

•fewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans

•losses on underwriting exposures or incremental client-specific downgrades,
or increases in the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs due to
higher financing costs for clients

•the loss of deposits, particularly if customers withdraw deposits because
they believe that interest rates offered by JPMorgan Chase are lower than
those of competitors or if JPMorgan Chase makes incorrect assumptions about
depositor behavior

•losses on available-for-sale ("AFS") securities held in the investment
securities portfolio

•lower net interest income if central banks introduce interest rate increases
more quickly than anticipated

and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of short-term and long-term
borrowings

•less liquidity in the financial markets, and

•higher funding costs.

All of these outcomes could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase's earnings or its
liquidity and capital levels. Higher interest rates can also negatively affect
the payment performance on loans within JPMorgan Chase's consumer and
wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable interest rates. If
borrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest
payments, those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing
JPMorgan Chase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to
servicing a higher volume of delinquent loans.

On the other hand, a low or negative interest rate environment may cause:

•net interest margins to be compressed, which could reduce the amounts that
JPMorgan Chase earns on its investment securities portfolio to the extent that
it is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments

•unanticipated or adverse changes in depositor behavior, which could
negatively affect JPMorgan Chase's broader asset and liability management
strategy, and

•a reduction in the value of JPMorgan Chase's mortgage servicing rights
("MSRs") asset, thereby decreasing revenues.

When credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive for JPMorgan Chase to
borrow. JPMorgan Chase's credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in
response to events and circumstances that are specific to JPMorgan Chase but
also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions.
Changes in JPMorgan Chase's credit spreads will affect, positively or
negatively, JPMorgan Chase's earnings on certain liabilities, such as
derivatives, that are recorded at fair value.

JPMorgan Chase's results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and
significant changes in the value of financial instruments.

The value of securities, derivatives and other financial instruments which
JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by
market fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and other
disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to value
certain financial instruments. Subsequent valuations of financial instruments
in future periods, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in
significant changes in the value of these instruments. In addition, at the
time of any disposition of these financial instruments, the price that
JPMorgan Chase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in
the market at that time and may be materially lower than their

| | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
  
16

| |  
  
* * *

  

current fair value. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of
financial instruments that JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets,
which may have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase's results of operations.

JPMorgan Chase's risk management and monitoring processes, including its
stress testing framework, seek to quantify and manage JPMorgan Chase's
exposure to more extreme market moves. However, JPMorgan Chase's hedging and
other risk management strategies may not be effective, and it could incur
significant losses, if extreme market events were to occur.

Credit

JPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected by adverse changes in the financial
condition of clients, counterparties, custodians and CCPs.

JPMorgan Chase routinely executes transactions with clients and counterparties
such as corporations, financial institutions, asset managers, hedge funds,
securities exchanges and government entities within and outside the U.S. Many
of these transactions expose JPMorgan Chase to the credit risk of its clients
and counterparties, and can involve JPMorgan Chase in disputes and litigation
if a client or counterparty defaults. JPMorgan Chase can also be subject to
losses or liability where a financial institution that it has appointed to
provide custodial services for client assets or funds becomes insolvent as a
result of fraud or the failure to abide by existing laws and obligations, or
where clients are unable to access assets held by JPMorgan Chase as custodian
due to governmental actions or other factors.

A default by, or the financial or operational failure of, a CCP through which
JPMorgan Chase executes contracts would require JPMorgan Chase to replace
those contracts, thereby increasing its operational costs and potentially
resulting in losses. In addition, JPMorgan Chase can be exposed to losses if a
member of a CCP in which JPMorgan Chase is also a member defaults on its
obligations to the CCP because of requirements that each member of the CCP
absorb a portion of those losses. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase can be subject
to bearing its share of non-default losses incurred by a CCP, including losses
from custodial, settlement or investment activities or due to cyber or other
security breaches.

As part of its clearing services activities, JPMorgan Chase is exposed to the
risk of nonperformance by its clients, which it seeks to mitigate by requiring
clients to provide adequate collateral. JPMorgan Chase is also exposed to
intra-day credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash
management, clearing, custodial and other transaction services to those
clients. If a client for which JPMorgan Chase provides these services becomes
bankrupt or insolvent, JPMorgan Chase may incur losses, become involved in
disputes and litigation with one or more CCPs, the client's bankruptcy estate
and other creditors, or be subject to regulatory investigations. All of the
foregoing events can increase JPMorgan Chase's operational and

litigation costs, and JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses to the extent that any
collateral that it has received is insufficient to cover those losses.

Transactions with government entities, including national, state, provincial,
municipal and local authorities, can expose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced
sovereign, credit, operational and reputation risks. Government entities may,
among other things, claim that actions taken by government officials were
beyond the legal authority of those officials or repudiate transactions
authorized by a previous incumbent government. These types of actions have in
the past caused, and could in the future cause, JPMorgan Chase to suffer
losses or hamper its ability to conduct business in the relevant jurisdiction.

In addition, local laws, rules and regulations could limit JPMorgan Chase's
ability to resolve disputes and litigation in the event of a counterparty
default or unwillingness to make previously agreed-upon payments, which could
subject JPMorgan Chase to losses.

Disputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts with regard to
the terms, the settlement procedures or the value of underlying collateral.
The disposition of those disputes could cause JPMorgan Chase to incur
unexpected transaction, operational and legal costs, or result in credit
losses. These consequences can also impair JPMorgan Chase's ability to
effectively manage its credit risk exposure from its market activities, or
cause harm to JPMorgan Chase's reputation.

The financial or operational failure of a significant market participant, such
as a major financial institution or a CCP, or concerns about the
creditworthiness of such a market participant or its ability to fulfill its
obligations, can cause substantial and cascading disruption within the
financial markets, including in circumstances where coordinated action by
multiple other market participants is required to address the failure or
disruption. JPMorgan Chase's businesses could be significantly disrupted by
such an event, particularly if it leads to other market participants incurring
significant losses, experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting, and JPMorgan
Chase is likely to have significant interrelationships with, and credit
exposure to, such a significant market participant.

JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses if the value of collateral declines in
stressed market conditions.

During periods of market stress or illiquidity, JPMorgan Chase's credit risk
may be further increased when:

•JPMorgan Chase fails to realize the fair value of the collateral it holds

•collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the
full amount owed to it, or

•counterparties are unable to post collateral, whether for operational or
other reasons.

Furthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning the valuation of
collateral may increase in times of significant

| | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| |

17  
  
* * *

Part I

market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and JPMorgan Chase could suffer
losses during these periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of
collateral or to manage declines in the value of collateral.

JPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses arising from concentrations of
credit and market risk.

JPMorgan Chase is exposed to greater credit and market risk to the extent that
groupings of its clients or counterparties:

•engage in similar or related businesses, or in businesses in related
industries

•do business in the same geographic region, or

•have business profiles, models or strategies that could cause their ability
to meet their obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic
conditions.

For example, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of
JPMorgan Chase's borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the
creditworthiness of other borrowers or counterparties in similar, related or
dependent industries. This type of interrelationship could exacerbate JPMorgan
Chase's credit, liquidity and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to
incur losses, including fair value losses in its market-making businesses and
investment portfolios. In addition, JPMorgan Chase may be required to increase
the allowance for credit losses with respect to certain clients or industries
in order to align with directives or expectations of its banking regulators.

Similarly, challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry
or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of JPMorgan
Chase's borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular industry or
geography but in related or dependent industries, wherever located. These
conditions could also heighten concerns about the ability of customers of
JPMorgan Chase's consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those
affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their
obligations to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various
segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess the potential risks
of concentration or contagion, but its ability to diversify or hedge its
exposure against those risks may be limited.

JPMorgan Chase's consumer businesses can also be harmed by an excessive
expansion of consumer credit by bank or non-bank competitors. Heightened
competition for certain types of consumer loans could prompt industry-wide
reactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or margins of those
loans or the making of loans to less-creditworthy borrowers. If large numbers
of consumers subsequently default on their loans, whether due to weak credit
profiles, an economic downturn or other factors, this could impair their
ability to repay obligations owed to JPMorgan Chase and result in higher
charge-offs and other credit-related losses. More broadly, widespread defaults
on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the

U.S. economy, and JPMorgan Chase's consumer businesses may earn lower revenues
in such an environment.

If JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce positions effectively during a market
dislocation, this can increase both the market and credit risks associated
with those positions and the level of risk-weighted-assets ("RWA") that
JPMorgan Chase holds on its balance sheet. These factors could adversely
affect JPMorgan Chase's capital position, funding costs and the profitability
of its businesses.

Liquidity

JPMorgan Chase's ability to operate its businesses could be impaired if its
liquidity is constrained.

JPMorgan Chase's liquidity could be impaired at any given time by factors such
as:

•market-wide illiquidity or disruption

•unforeseen liquidity or capital requirements, including as a result of
changes in laws, rules and regulations

•inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at favorable times or prices

•default by a CCP or other significant market participant

•unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral

•unexpected loss of consumer deposits or higher than anticipated draws on
lending-related commitments, and

•lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan Chase or financial
institutions in general.

A reduction in JPMorgan Chase's liquidity may be caused by events over which
it has little or no control. For example, periods of market stress, low
investor confidence and significant market illiquidity could result in higher
funding costs for JPMorgan Chase and could limit its access to some of its
traditional sources of liquidity.

JPMorgan Chase may need to raise funding from alternative sources if its
access to stable and lower-cost sources of funding, such as deposits and
borrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is reduced. Alternative sources of
funding could be more expensive or limited in availability. JPMorgan Chase's
funding costs could also be negatively affected by actions that JPMorgan Chase
may take in order to:

•satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio
requirements

•address obligations under its resolution plan, or

•satisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside the U.S. relating to
the pre-positioning of liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal
entities.

More generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails to effectively manage its liquidity,
this could constrain its ability to fund or invest in its businesses and
subsidiaries, and thereby adversely affect its results of operations.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company and depends on the cash flows of its
subsidiaries to make payments on its outstanding securities.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company that holds the stock of JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. and an intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings
LLC (the "IHC"). The IHC in turn generally holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase's
subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The
IHC also owns other assets and provides intercompany lending to the holding
company.

The holding company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all
the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of
senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock).

The ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC to make payments to the
holding company is also limited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to
regulatory restrictions on its dividend distributions, as well as capital
adequacy requirements, such as the Supplementary Leverage Ratio ("SLR"), and
liquidity requirements and other regulatory restrictions on its ability to
make payments to the holding company. The IHC is prohibited from paying
dividends or extending credit to the holding company if certain capital or
liquidity thresholds are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by
JPMorgan Chase's management or Board of Directors.

As a result of these arrangements, the ability of the holding company to make
various payments is dependent on its receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. and dividends and borrowings from the IHC. These limitations could
affect the holding company's ability to:

•pay interest on its debt securities

•pay dividends on its equity securities

•redeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and

•fulfill its other payment obligations.

These arrangements could also result in the holding company seeking protection
under bankruptcy laws or otherwise entering into resolution proceedings at a
time earlier than would have been the case absent the existence of the capital
and liquidity thresholds to which the IHC is subject.

Reductions in JPMorgan Chase's credit ratings may adversely affect its
liquidity and cost of funding.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal subsidiaries are rated by
credit rating agencies. Rating agencies evaluate general, firm-specific and
industry-specific factors when determining credit ratings for a particular
financial institution, including:

•expected future profitability

•risk management practices

•legal expenses

•ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and non-
bank subsidiaries

•regulatory developments

•assumptions about government support, and

•economic and geopolitical developments.

JPMorgan Chase closely monitors and manages, to the extent that it is able,
factors that could influence its credit ratings. However, there is no
assurance that JPMorgan Chase's credit ratings will not be lowered in the
future. Furthermore, any such downgrade could occur at times of broader market
instability when JPMorgan Chase's options for responding to events may be more
limited and general investor confidence is low.

A reduction in JPMorgan Chase's credit ratings could curtail JPMorgan Chase's
business activities and reduce its profitability in a number of ways,
including:

•reducing its access to capital markets

•materially increasing its cost of issuing and servicing securities

•triggering additional collateral or funding requirements, and

•decreasing the number of investors and counterparties that are willing or
permitted to do business with or lend to JPMorgan Chase.

Any rating reduction could also increase the credit spreads charged by the
market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries.
This could, in turn, adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations
of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries.

The transition to alternative reference rates could expose JPMorgan Chase to
operational risks or litigation and other disputes.

Regulators, industry bodies and other market participants in the U.S. and
other countries continue to engage in initiatives to introduce and encourage
the use of alternative reference rates to replace certain interest rate
indices that are deemed to be "benchmarks", and certain of these alternative
rates have gained or are gaining acceptance among market participants.
However, there is no assurance that:

•any of these new rates will be similar to, or produce the economic equivalent
of, the benchmarks that they seek to replace

•arrangements by market participants to prepare for the discontinuation of
certain benchmarks and the transition to alternative reference rates will be
fully effective, or

•a particular alternative reference rate will be widely accepted by market
participants, or that market acceptance of that rate will not be hindered by
the introduction of other reference rates.

Part I

For example, vast amounts of loans, mortgages, securities, derivatives and
other financial instruments are still linked to the London Interbank Offered
Rate ("LIBOR") benchmark, and significant progress has been made by
regulators, industry bodies and market participants to introduce and implement
the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") as a replacement rate for U.S.
dollar LIBOR. However, if market participants have not implemented effective
operational and other arrangements to address the transition from U.S. dollar
LIBOR to SOFR, this could result in dislocation in the financial markets,
volatility in the pricing of securities, derivatives and other instruments,
and the suppression of capital markets activities, all of which could have a
negative impact on JPMorgan Chase's results of operations and on U.S. dollar
LIBOR-linked securities, credit or other instruments which are issued, funded,
serviced or held by JPMorgan Chase.

JPMorgan Chase could also become involved in litigation and other types of
disputes with clients, customers, counterparties and investors as a
consequence of the transition from U.S. dollar LIBOR and other benchmark rates
to replacement rates, including claims that JPMorgan Chase has:

•treated clients, customers, counterparties or investors unfairly, or caused
them to experience losses, higher financing costs or lower returns on
investments

•failed to appropriately communicate the effects of the transition from
benchmark rates on the products that JPMorgan Chase has sold to its clients
and customers, or failed to disclose purported conflicts of interest

•made inappropriate product recommendations to or investments on behalf of its
clients, or sold products that did not serve their intended purpose, in
connection with the transition from benchmark rates

•engaged in anti-competitive behavior, or in the manipulation of markets or
specific benchmarks, in connection with the discontinuation of or transition
from benchmark rates, or

•disadvantaged clients, customers, counterparties or investors when
interpreting or making determinations under the terms of agreements or
financial instruments.

These types of claims could subject JPMorgan Chase to higher legal expenses
and operational costs, require it to pay significant amounts in connection
with resolving litigation and other disputes, and harm its reputation.

Capital

Maintaining the required level and composition of capital may impact JPMorgan
Chase's ability to support business activities, meet evolving regulatory
requirements and distribute capital to shareholders.

JPMorgan Chase is subject to various regulatory capital requirements,
including leverage- and risk-based capital requirements. In addition, as a
Globally Systemically

Important Bank ("GSIB"), JPMorgan Chase is required to hold additional capital
buffers, including a GSIB surcharge, a Stress Capital Buffer ("SCB"), and a
countercyclical buffer, each of which is reassessed at least annually. The
amount of capital that JPMorgan Chase is required to hold in order to satisfy
these leverage-and risk-based requirements could increase at any given time
due to factors such as:

•actions by banking regulators, including changes in laws, rules, and
regulations

•actions taken by the Federal Reserve or the U.S. government in response to
the economic effects of systemic events, such as the actions taken in response
to the COVID-19 pandemic which led to an expansion of the Federal Reserve
balance sheet, growth in deposits held by JPMorgan Chase and other U.S.
financial institutions and, consequently, an increase in leverage exposure and
the GSIB surcharge

•changes in the composition of JPMorgan Chase's balance sheet or developments
that could increase RWA, such as increased market risk, customer
delinquencies, client credit rating downgrades or other factors, and

•increases in estimated stress losses as determined by the Federal Reserve
under the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which could increase
JPMorgan Chase's SCB.

Any failure by or inability of JPMorgan Chase to maintain the required level
and composition of capital, or unfavorable changes in applicable capital
requirements, could have an adverse impact on JPMorgan Chase's shareholders,
such as:

•reducing the amount of common stock that JPMorgan Chase is permitted to
repurchase

•requiring the issuance of, or prohibiting the redemption of, capital
instruments in a manner inconsistent with JPMorgan Chase's capital management
strategy

•constraining the amount of dividends that may be paid on common stock, or

•curtailing JPMorgan Chase's business activities or operations.

Operational

JPMorgan Chase's businesses are dependent on the effectiveness of its
operational systems and those of other market participants.

JPMorgan Chase's businesses rely on the ability of JPMorgan Chase's financial,
accounting, transaction execution, data processing and other operational
systems to process, record, monitor and report a large number of transactions
on a continuous basis, and to do so accurately, quickly and securely. In
addition to proper design, installation, maintenance and training, the
effective

| | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
  
20

| |  
  
* * *

  

functioning of JPMorgan Chase's operational systems depends on:

•the quality of the information contained in those systems, as inaccurate,
outdated or corrupted data can significantly compromise the functionality or
reliability of a particular system and other systems to which it transmits or
from which it receives information, and

•the ability of JPMorgan Chase to appropriately maintain and upgrade its
systems on a regular basis, and to ensure that any changes introduced to its
systems are managed carefully to ensure security and operational continuity
and adherence to all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

JPMorgan Chase also depends on its ability to access and use the operational
systems of third parties, including its custodians, vendors (such as those
that provide data and cloud computing services, and security and technology
services) and other market participants (such as clearing and payment systems,
CCPs and securities exchanges).

The ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of operational systems upon
which JPMorgan Chase depends, including due to a systems malfunction,
cyberbreach or other systems failure, could result in unfavorable ripple
effects in the financial markets and for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and
customers, including:

•delays or other disruptions in providing services, liquidity or information
to clients and customers

•the inability to settle transactions or obtain access to funds and other
assets, including those for which physical settlement and delivery is required

•failure to timely settle or confirm transactions

•the possibility that funds transfers, capital markets trades or other
transactions are executed erroneously, as a result of illegal conduct or with
unintended consequences

•financial losses, including due to loss-sharing requirements of CCPs, payment
systems or other market infrastructures, or as possible restitution to clients
and customers

•higher operational costs associated with replacing services provided by a
system that is unavailable

•client or customer dissatisfaction with JPMorgan Chase's products and
services

•limitations on JPMorgan Chase's ability to collect data as required in
connection with regulatory or other investigations

•regulatory fines, penalties, or other sanctions against JPMorgan Chase

•loss of confidence in the ability of JPMorgan Chase, or financial
institutions generally, to protect against and withstand operational
disruptions, or

•harm to JPMorgan Chase's reputation.

As the speed, frequency, volume, interconnectivity and complexity of
transactions continue to increase, it can become more challenging to
effectively maintain and upgrade JPMorgan Chase's operational systems and
infrastructure, especially due to the heightened risks that:

•attempts by third parties to defraud JPMorgan Chase or its clients and
customers may increase, evolve or become more complex, particularly during
periods of market disruption or economic uncertainty

•errors made by JPMorgan Chase or another market participant, whether
inadvertent or malicious, cause widespread system disruption

•isolated or seemingly insignificant errors in operational systems compound,
or migrate to other systems over time, to become larger issues

•failures in synchronization or encryption software, or degraded performance
of microprocessors, could cause disruptions in operational systems, or the
inability of systems to communicate with each other, and

•third parties may attempt to block the use of key technology solutions by
claiming that the use infringes on their intellectual property rights.

If JPMorgan Chase's operational systems, or those of newly-acquired businesses
or of external parties on which JPMorgan Chase's businesses depend, are unable
to meet the requirements of JPMorgan Chase's businesses and operations or bank
regulatory standards, or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings,
JPMorgan Chase could be materially and adversely affected.

A successful cyber attack affecting JPMorgan Chase could cause significant
harm to JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers.

JPMorgan Chase experiences numerous cyber attacks on its computer systems,
software, networks and other technology assets on a daily basis from various
actors, including groups acting on behalf of hostile countries, cyber-
criminals, "hacktivists" (i.e., individuals or groups that use technology to
promote a political agenda or social change) and others. These cyber attacks
can take many forms, including attempts to introduce computer viruses or
malicious code, which are commonly referred to as "malware," into JPMorgan
Chase's systems. These attacks are often designed to:

•obtain unauthorized access to confidential information belonging to JPMorgan
Chase or its clients, customers, counterparties or employees

•manipulate data

•destroy data or systems with the aim of rendering services unavailable

•disrupt, sabotage or degrade service on JPMorgan Chase's systems

Part I

•steal money, or

•extort money through the use of so-called "ransomware."

JPMorgan Chase has also experienced:

•significant distributed denial-of-service attacks intended to disrupt online
banking services and other business activities, and

•a higher volume and complexity of cyber attacks against the backdrop of
heightened geopolitical tensions.

JPMorgan Chase has experienced security breaches due to cyber attacks in the
past, and it is inevitable that additional breaches will occur in the future.
Any such breach could result in serious and harmful consequences for JPMorgan
Chase or its clients and customers.

A principal reason that JPMorgan Chase cannot provide absolute security
against cyber attacks is that it may not always be possible to anticipate,
detect or recognize threats to JPMorgan Chase's systems, or to implement
effective preventive measures against all breaches because:

•the techniques used in cyber attacks evolve frequently and are increasingly
sophisticated, and therefore may not be recognized until launched

•cyber attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including
JPMorgan Chase's own employees, cyber-criminals, hacktivists, groups linked to
terrorist organizations or hostile countries, or third parties whose objective
is to disrupt the operations of financial institutions more generally

•JPMorgan Chase does not have control over the cybersecurity of the systems of
the large number of clients, customers, counterparties and third-party service
providers with which it does business, and

•it is possible that a third party, after establishing a foothold on an
internal network without being detected, might obtain access to other networks
and systems.

The risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack could increase in the
future due to factors such as:

•JPMorgan Chase's ongoing expansion of its mobile banking and other internet-
based product offerings and its internal use of internet-based products and
applications, including those that use cloud computing services

•the acquisition and integration of new businesses, and

•the increased use of remote access and third party video conferencing
solutions to facilitate work-from-home arrangements for employees.

In addition, a third party could misappropriate confidential information
obtained by intercepting signals or

communications from mobile devices used by JPMorgan Chase's employees.

A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of JPMorgan Chase's
systems or the systems of a vendor, governmental body or another market
participant could cause serious negative consequences, including:

•significant disruption of JPMorgan Chase's operations and those of its
clients, customers and counterparties, including losing access to operational
systems

•misappropriation of confidential information of JPMorgan Chase or that of its
clients, customers, counterparties, employees or regulators

•disruption of or damage to JPMorgan Chase's systems and those of its clients,
customers and counterparties

•the inability, or extended delays in the ability, to fully recover and
restore data that has been stolen, manipulated or destroyed, or the inability
to prevent systems from processing fraudulent transactions

•violations by JPMorgan Chase of applicable privacy and other laws

•financial loss to JPMorgan Chase or to its clients, customers, counterparties
or employees

•loss of confidence in JPMorgan Chase's cybersecurity and business resiliency
measures

•dissatisfaction among JPMorgan Chase's clients, customers or counterparties

•significant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other
sanctions, and

•harm to JPMorgan Chase's reputation.

The extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps that JPMorgan Chase may
need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it
may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be
completed. While such an investigation is ongoing, JPMorgan Chase may not
necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyber attack, and
that damage may continue to spread. These factors may inhibit JPMorgan Chase's
ability to provide rapid, full and reliable information about the cyber attack
to its clients, customers, counterparties and regulators, as well as the
public. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the
harm caused by the cyber attack, and certain errors or actions could be
repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Any or all
of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber
attack.

JPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected if it fails to identify and address
operational risks associated with the introduction of or changes to products,
services and delivery platforms.

When JPMorgan Chase launches a new product or service, introduces a new
platform for the delivery or distribution of products or services (including
mobile connectivity, electronic trading and cloud computing), acquires or
invests in a business or makes changes to an existing product, service or
delivery platform, it may not fully appreciate or identify new operational
risks that may arise from those changes, or may fail to implement adequate
controls to mitigate the risks associated with those changes. Any significant
failure in this regard could diminish JPMorgan Chase's ability to operate one
or more of its businesses or result in:

•potential liability to clients, counterparties and customers

•increased operating expenses

•higher litigation costs, including regulatory fines, penalties and other
sanctions

•damage to JPMorgan Chase's reputation

•impairment of JPMorgan Chase's liquidity

•regulatory intervention, or

•weaker competitive standing.

Any of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect
JPMorgan Chase's businesses and results of operations.

JPMorgan Chase's operational costs and customer satisfaction could be
adversely affected by the failure of an external operational system.

External operational systems with which JPMorgan is connected, whether
directly or indirectly, can be sources of operational risk to JPMorgan Chase.
JPMorgan Chase may be exposed not only to a systems failure or cyber attack
that may be experienced by a vendor or market infrastructure with which
JPMorgan Chase is directly connected, but also to a systems breakdown or cyber
attack involving another party to which such a vendor or infrastructure is
connected. Similarly, retailers, payment systems and processors, data
aggregators and other external parties with which JPMorgan Chase's customers
do business can increase JPMorgan Chase's operational risk. This is
particularly the case where activities of customers or other parties are
beyond JPMorgan Chase's security and control systems, including through the
use of the internet, cloud computing services, and personal smart phones and
other mobile devices or services.

If an external party obtains access to customer account data on JPMorgan
Chase's systems, whether authorized or unauthorized, and that party
experiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or misappropriates that data,
this could

result in a variety of negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase and its clients
and customers, including:

•heightened risk that external parties will be able to execute fraudulent
transactions using JPMorgan Chase's systems

•losses from fraudulent transactions, as well as potential liability for
losses that exceed thresholds established in consumer protection laws, rules
and regulations

•increased operational costs to remediate the consequences of the external
party's security breach, and

•reputational harm arising from the perception that JPMorgan Chase's systems
may not be secure.

As JPMorgan Chase's interconnectivity with clients, customers and other
external parties continues to expand, JPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the
risk of operational failure or cyber attacks with respect to the systems of
those parties. Security breaches affecting JPMorgan Chase's clients or
customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or human error
or misconduct affecting other external parties, may require JPMorgan Chase to
take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to
safeguard confidential information, including restricting the access of
customers to their accounts. These actions can increase JPMorgan Chase's
operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction and
confidence in JPMorgan Chase.

Furthermore, the widespread and expanding interconnectivity among financial
institutions, clearing banks, CCPs, payments processors, financial technology
companies, securities exchanges, clearing houses and other financial market
infrastructures increases the risk that the disruption of an operational
system involving one institution or entity, including due to a cyber attack,
may cause industry-wide operational disruptions that could materially affect
JPMorgan Chase's ability to conduct business.

JPMorgan Chase's business and operations rely on its ability, and the ability
of key external parties, to maintain appropriately-staffed workforces, and on
the competence, trustworthiness, health and safety of employees.

JPMorgan Chase's ability to operate its businesses efficiently and profitably,
to offer products and services that meet the expectations of its clients and
customers, and to maintain an effective risk management framework is highly
dependent on its ability to staff its operations appropriately and on the
competence, integrity, health and safety of its employees. JPMorgan Chase's
businesses and operations similarly rely on the workforces of third parties,
including employees of vendors, custodians and financial markets
infrastructures, and of businesses that it may seek to acquire. JPMorgan
Chase's businesses could be materially and adversely affected by:

•the ineffective implementation of business decisions

| | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| |

23  
  
* * *

Part I

•any failure to institute controls that appropriately address risks associated
with business activities, or to appropriately train employees with respect to
those risks and controls

•staffing shortages, particularly in tight labor markets

•the possibility that significant portions of JPMorgan Chase's workforce are
unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines,
shelter-in-place arrangements, government actions or other restrictions in
connection with health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases,
epidemics or pandemics

•a significant operational breakdown or failure, theft, fraud or other
unlawful conduct, or

•other negative outcomes caused by human error or misconduct by an employee of
JPMorgan Chase or of another party on which JPMorgan Chase's businesses or
operations depend.

JPMorgan Chase's operations could also be impaired if the measures taken by it
or by governmental authorities to help ensure the health and safety of its
employees are ineffective, or if any external party on which JPMorgan Chase
relies fails to take appropriate and effective actions to protect the health
and safety of its employees.

JPMorgan Chase faces substantial legal and operational risks in the processing
and safeguarding of personal information.

JPMorgan Chase's businesses and operations are subject to complex and evolving
laws, rules and regulations, both within and outside the U.S., governing the
privacy and protection of personal information of individuals. Governmental
authorities around the world have adopted and are considering the adoption of
numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning privacy, data
protection and security. Litigation or enforcement actions relating to these
laws, rules and regulations could result in

fines or orders requiring that JPMorgan Chase change its data-related
practices, which could have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase's ability to
provide products and otherwise harm its business operations.

Implementing processes relating to JPMorgan Chase's collection, use, sharing
and storage of personal information to comply with all applicable laws, rules
and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions, including where the laws of
different jurisdictions are in conflict, can:

•increase JPMorgan Chase's compliance and operating costs

•hinder the development of new products or services, curtail the offering of
existing products or services, or affect how products and services are offered
to clients and customers

•demand significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase's management, and

•require JPMorgan Chase to structure its businesses, operations and systems in
less efficient ways.

Not all of JPMorgan Chase's clients, customers, vendors, counterparties and
other external parties may have appropriate controls in place to protect the
confidentiality, integrity or availability of the information exchanged
between them and JPMorgan Chase, particularly where information is transmitted
by electronic means. JPMorgan Chase could be exposed to litigation or
regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions if personal information of
clients, customers, employees or others were to be mishandled or misused, such
as situations where such information is:

•erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the
information, or

•intercepted or otherwise compromised by unauthorized third parties.

Concerns regarding the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase's measures to safeguard
personal information, or even the perception that those measures are
inadequate, could cause JPMorgan Chase to lose existing or potential clients
and customers or employees, and thereby reduce JPMorgan Chase's revenues.
Furthermore, any failure or perceived failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with
applicable privacy or data protection laws, rules and regulations may subject
it to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in
requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, significant
liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of these
could damage JPMorgan Chase's reputation and otherwise adversely affect its
businesses.

In recent years, well-publicized incidents involving the inappropriate
collection, use, sharing or storage of personal information have led to
expanded governmental scrutiny of practices relating to the processing or
safeguarding of personal information by companies in the U.S. and other
countries. That scrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and could in the
future lead to, the adoption of stricter laws, rules and regulations relating
to the collection, use, sharing and storage of personal information. These
types of laws, rules and regulations could prohibit or significantly restrict
financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase from transferring information
across national borders or sharing information among affiliates or with third
parties such as vendors, thereby increase compliance costs, or could restrict
JPMorgan Chase's use of personal information when developing or offering
products or services to customers. Some countries are considering or have
adopted legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring
local storage and processing of data which could increase the cost and
complexity of JPMorgan Chase's delivery of products and services. These
restrictions could also inhibit JPMorgan Chase's development or marketing of
certain products or services, or increase the costs of offering them to
customers.

JPMorgan Chase's operations, results and reputation could be harmed by
occurrences of extraordinary events beyond its control.

JPMorgan Chase's business and operational systems could be seriously
disrupted, and its reputation could be harmed, by events or contributing
factors that are wholly or partially beyond its control, including material
instances of:

•cyber attacks

•security breaches of its physical premises, including threats to health and
safety

•power, telecommunications or internet outages, or shutdowns of mass transit

•failure of, or loss of access to, technology or operational systems,
including any resulting loss of critical data

•damage to or loss of property or assets of JPMorgan Chase or third parties,
and any consequent injuries, including in connection with any construction
projects undertaken by JPMorgan Chase

•effects of climate change

•natural disasters or severe weather conditions

•accidents such as explosions or structural failures

•health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or
pandemics, or

•events arising from local or larger-scale civil or political unrest, any
outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or terrorist acts.

JPMorgan Chase maintains a Firmwide resiliency program that is intended to
enable it to recover critical business functions and supporting assets,
including staff, technology and facilities, in the event of a business
disruption, including due to the occurrence of an extraordinary event beyond
its control. There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase's resiliency plans
will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to JPMorgan Chase,
its clients, and customers and third parties with which it does business, or
that its resiliency plans will be adequate to address the effects of
simultaneous occurrences of multiple business disruption events. In addition,
JPMorgan Chase's ability to respond effectively to a business disruption event
could be hampered to the extent that the members of its workforce, physical
assets or systems and other support infrastructure needed to address the event
are geographically dispersed, or conversely, if such an event were to occur in
an area in which they are concentrated. Further, should extraordinary events
or the factors that cause or contribute to those events become more chronic,
the disruptive effects of those events on JPMorgan Chase's business and
operations, and on its clients, customers, counterparties and employees, could
become more significant and long-lasting.

Any significant failure or disruption of JPMorgan Chase's operations or
operational systems, or the occurrence of one or more extraordinary events
that are beyond its control, could:

•hinder JPMorgan Chase's ability to provide services to its clients and
customers or to transact with its counterparties

•require it to expend significant resources to correct the failure or
disruption or to address the event

•cause it to incur losses or liabilities, including from loss of revenue,
damage to or loss of property, or injuries

•disrupt market infrastructure systems on which JPMorgan Chase's businesses
rely

•expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions,
and

•harm its reputation.

Enhanced regulatory and other standards for the oversight of vendors and other
service providers can result in higher costs and other potential exposures.

JPMorgan Chase must comply with enhanced regulatory and other standards
associated with doing business with vendors and other service providers,
including standards relating to the outsourcing of functions as well as the
performance of significant banking and other functions by subsidiaries.
JPMorgan Chase incurs significant costs and expenses in connection with its
initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its internal and
external service providers. JPMorgan Chase's failure to appropriately assess
and manage these relationships, especially those involving significant banking
functions, shared services or other critical activities, could materially
adversely affect JPMorgan Chase. Specifically, any such failure could result
in:

•potential harm to clients and customers, and any liability associated with
that harm

•regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions

•lower revenues, and the opportunity cost from lost revenues

•increased operational costs, or

•harm to JPMorgan Chase's reputation.

JPMorgan Chase's risk management framework may not be effective in identifying
and mitigating every risk to JPMorgan Chase.

Any inadequacy or lapse in JPMorgan Chase's risk management framework,
governance structure, practices, models or reporting systems could expose it
to unexpected losses, and its financial condition or results of operations
could be materially and adversely affected. Any such inadequacy or lapse
could:

25  
  
* * *

Part I

•hinder the timely escalation of material risk issues to JPMorgan Chase's
senior management and Board of Directors

•lead to business decisions that have negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase

•require significant resources and time to remediate

•lead to non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations

•attract heightened regulatory scrutiny

•expose JPMorgan Chase to litigation, regulatory investigations or regulatory
fines, penalties or other sanctions

•lead to potential harm to customers and clients, and any liability associated
with that harm

•harm its reputation, or

•otherwise diminish confidence in JPMorgan Chase.

JPMorgan Chase relies on data to assess its various risk exposures. Any
deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase's data
gathering, analysis and validation processes could result in ineffective risk
management practices. These deficiencies could also result in inaccurate or
untimely risk reporting.

Many of JPMorgan Chase's risk management strategies and techniques consider
historical market behavior and to some degree are based on management's
subjective judgment or assumptions. For example, many models used by JPMorgan
Chase are based on assumptions regarding historical correlations among prices
of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market
stress, including difficult or less liquid market environments, or in the
event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators
may become correlated. Conversely, previously-correlated indicators may become
uncorrelated at those times. Sudden market movements and unanticipated market
or economic movements could, in some circumstances, limit the effectiveness of
JPMorgan Chase's risk management strategies, causing it to incur losses.

JPMorgan Chase could recognize unexpected losses, its capital levels could be
reduced and it could face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models,
estimations or judgments, including those used in its financial statements,
prove to be inadequate or incorrect.

JPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a variety of models and other analytical
and judgment-based estimations to measure, monitor and implement controls over
its market, credit, capital, liquidity, operational and other risks. JPMorgan
Chase also uses internal models and estimations as a basis for its stress
testing and in connection with the preparation of its financial statements
under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP").

These models and estimations are based on a variety of assumptions and
historical trends, and are periodically

reviewed and modified as necessary. The models and estimations that JPMorgan
Chase uses may not be effective in all cases to identify, observe and mitigate
risk due to a variety of factors, such as:

•reliance on historical trends that may not persist in the future, including
assumptions underlying the models and estimations such as correlations among
certain market indicators or asset prices

•inherent limitations associated with forecasting uncertain economic and
financial outcomes

•historical trend information may be incomplete, or may not be indicative of
severely negative market conditions such as extreme volatility, dislocation or
lack of liquidity

•sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and
securities may make it more difficult to value certain financial instruments

•technology that is introduced to run models or estimations may not perform as
expected, or may not be well understood by the personnel using the technology

•models and estimations may contain erroneous data, valuations, formulas or
algorithms, and

•review processes may fail to detect flaws in models and estimations.

JPMorgan Chase may experience unexpected losses if models, estimates or
judgments used or applied in connection with its risk management activities or
the preparation of its financial statements prove to have been inadequate or
incorrect. For example, where quoted market prices are not available for
certain financial instruments that require a determination of their fair
value, JPMorgan Chase may make fair value determinations based on internally
developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on
management estimates and judgment.

Similarly, JPMorgan Chase establishes an allowance for expected credit losses
related to its credit exposures which requires significant judgments,
including forecasts of how macroeconomic conditions might impair the ability
of JPMorgan Chase's clients and customers to repay their loans or other
obligations. These types of estimates and judgments may not prove to be
accurate due to a variety of factors, as noted above. This is particularly
true when the current and forecasted environments are significantly different
from the historical environments upon which the models were developed, as
JPMorgan Chase experienced during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The increased uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment and
analytics to inform any adjustments that JPMorgan Chase may make to model
outputs than would otherwise be the case.

Some of the models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations used by
JPMorgan Chase in managing

| | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

risks are subject to review by, and require the approval of, JPMorgan Chase's
regulators. These reviews are required before JPMorgan Chase may use those
models and estimations for calculating market risk RWA, credit risk RWA and
operational risk RWA under Basel III. If JPMorgan Chase's models or
estimations are not approved by its regulators, it may be subject to higher
capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial results or limit
the ability to expand its businesses.

Lapses in controls over disclosure or financial reporting could materially
affect JPMorgan Chase's profitability or reputation.

There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase's disclosure controls and
procedures will be effective in every circumstance, or that a material
weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial
reporting will not occur. Any such lapses or deficiencies could result in
inaccurate financial reporting which, in turn, could:

•materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase's business and results of
operations or financial condition

•restrict its ability to access the capital markets

•require it to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or
deficiencies

•expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions

•harm its reputation, or

•otherwise diminish investor confidence in JPMorgan Chase.

Strategic

If JPMorgan Chase's management fails to develop and execute effective business
strategies, and to anticipate changes affecting those strategies, JPMorgan
Chase's competitive standing and results could suffer.

JPMorgan Chase's business strategies significantly affect its competitive
standing and operations. These strategies relate to:

•the products and services that JPMorgan Chase offers

•the geographies in which it operates

•the types of clients and customers that it serves

•the businesses that it acquires or in which it invests

•the counterparties with which it does business, and

•the methods and distribution channels by which it offers products and
services.

If management makes choices about these strategies and goals that prove to be
incorrect, are based on incomplete, inaccurate or fraudulent information, do
not accurately assess the competitive landscape and industry trends, or fail
to address changing regulatory and market environments or the expectations of
clients, customers,

investors, employees and other stakeholders, then the franchise values and
growth prospects of JPMorgan Chase's businesses may suffer and its earnings
could decline.

JPMorgan Chase's growth prospects also depend on management's ability to
develop and execute effective business plans to address these strategic
priorities, both in the near term and over longer time horizons. Management's
effectiveness in this regard will affect JPMorgan Chase's ability to develop
and enhance its resources, control expenses and return capital to
shareholders. Each of these objectives could be adversely affected by any
failure on the part of management to:

•devise effective business plans and strategies

•offer products and services that meet changing expectations of clients and
customers

•allocate capital in a manner that promotes long-term stability to enable
JPMorgan Chase to build and invest in market-leading businesses, even in a
highly stressed environment

•allocate capital appropriately due to imprecise modeling or subjective
judgments made in connection with those allocations

•conduct appropriate due diligence on prospective business acquisitions or
investments, or effectively integrate newly-acquired businesses

•appropriately address concerns of clients, customers, investors, employees
and other stakeholders, including with respect to ESG matters

•react quickly to changes in market conditions or market structures, or

•develop and enhance the operational, technology, risk, financial and
managerial resources necessary to grow and manage JPMorgan Chase's businesses.

Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase may incur costs in connection with disposing of
excess properties, premises and facilities, and those costs could be material
to its results of operations in a given period.

JPMorgan Chase faces significant and increasing competition in the rapidly
evolving financial services industry.

JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment in which it must
evolve and adapt to the significant changes as a result of changes in
financial regulation, technological advances, increased public scrutiny and
changes in economic conditions. JPMorgan Chase expects that competition in the
U.S. and global financial services industry will continue to be intense.
Competitors include:

•other banks and financial institutions

•trading, advisory and investment management firms

•finance companies

| | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| |

27  
  
* * *

Part I

•technology companies, and

•other nonbank firms that are engaged in providing similar as well as new
products and services.

JPMorgan Chase cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in
the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its
future results of operations. For example, aggressive or less disciplined
lending practices by nonbank competitors could lead to a loss of market share
for traditional banks, and in an economic downturn could result in instability
in the financial services industry and adversely impact other market
participants, including JPMorgan Chase.

New competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge. For
example, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it
possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that
traditionally were banking products. These advances have also allowed
financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-
based financial solutions, including electronic securities and cryptocurrency
trading, lending and other extensions of credit to consumers, payments
processing and online automated algorithmic-based investment advice.
Furthermore, both financial institutions and their non-banking competitors
face the risk that payments processing and other products and services,
including deposits and other traditional banking products, could be
significantly disrupted by the use of new technologies, such as
cryptocurrencies and other applications using secure distributed ledgers, that
require no intermediation. New technologies have required and could require
JPMorgan Chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and
retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its
competitors, including technology companies. In addition, new technologies may
be used by customers, or breached or infiltrated by third parties, in
unexpected ways, which can increase JPMorgan Chase's costs for complying with
laws, rules and regulations that apply to the offering of products and
services through those technologies and reduce the income that JPMorgan Chase
earns from providing products and services through those technologies.

Ongoing or increased competition may put pressure on the pricing for JPMorgan
Chase's products and services or may cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market
share, particularly with respect to traditional banking products. This
competition may be on the basis of quality and variety of products and
services offered, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. The
failure of any of JPMorgan Chase's businesses to meet the expectations of
clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions, under-
performance, a decision not to offer a particular product or service, changes
in client and customer expectations or other factors, could affect JPMorgan
Chase's ability to attract or retain clients and customers. Any such impact
could, in turn, reduce JPMorgan Chase's revenues. Increased competition also

may require JPMorgan Chase to make additional capital investments in its
businesses, or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order
to remain competitive.

The effects of climate change could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase's business
and operations, both directly and as a result of impacts on its clients and
customers.

JPMorgan Chase operates in many regions, countries and communities around the
world where its business, and the activities of its clients and customers,
could be adversely affected by climate change. Climate change could manifest
as a financial risk to JPMorgan Chase either through changes in the physical
climate or from the process of transitioning to a lower-carbon economy. Both
physical risks and transition risks associated with climate change could have
negative impacts on the financial condition or creditworthiness of JPMorgan's
clients and customers, and on its exposure to those clients and customers.

Climate-related physical risks include the increased frequency or severity of
acute weather events, such as floods, wildfires and tropical storms, and
chronic shifts in the climate, such as persistent changes in precipitation
levels, rising sea levels, or increases in average ambient
temperature.Potential adverse impacts of climate-related physical risks
include:

•declines in asset values, including due to the destruction or degradation of
property

•reduced availability or increased cost of insurance for clients of JPMorgan
Chase

•interruptions to business operations, including supply chain disruption, and

•population migration or unemployment in affected regions.

Transition risks arise from societal adjustment to a lower-carbon economy,
such as changes in public policy, adoption of new technologies or changes in
consumer preferences towards low-carbon goods and services. These risks could
also be influenced by changes in the physical climate. Potential adverse
impacts of transition risks include:

•sudden devaluation of assets, including unanticipated write-downs ("stranded
assets")

•increased operational and compliance costs driven by changes in climate
policy

•increased energy costs driven by governmental actions and initiatives such as
higher taxation and accelerated decarbonization policies

•negative consequences to business models, and the need to make changes in
response to those consequences, and

•damage to JPMorgan Chase's reputation, including due to any perception that
its business practices are

| | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
  
28

| |  
  
* * *

  

contrary to public policy or the preferences of different stakeholders.

Climate risks can also arise from the inconsistencies and conflicts in the
manner in which climate policy and financial regulation is implemented in the
many regions where JPMorgan Chase operates, including initiatives to apply and
enforce policy and regulation with extraterritorial effect.

Conduct

Conduct failure by JPMorgan Chase employees can harm clients and customers,
impact market integrity, damage JPMorgan Chase's reputation and trigger
litigation and regulatory action.

JPMorgan Chase's employees interact with clients, customers and
counterparties, and with each other, every day. All employees are expected to
demonstrate values and exhibit the behaviors that are an integral part of
JPMorgan Chase's Code of Conduct and How We Do Business Principles, including
JPMorgan Chase's commitment to "do first class business in a first class way."
JPMorgan Chase endeavors to embed conduct risk management throughout an
employee's life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and
development, and performance management. Conduct risk management is also an
integral component of JPMorgan Chase's promotion and compensation processes.

Notwithstanding these expectations, policies and practices, certain employees
have engaged in improper or illegal conduct in the past. These instances of
misconduct have resulted in litigation, and resolutions of governmental
investigations or enforcement actions involving consent orders, deferred
prosecution agreements, non-prosecution agreements and other civil or criminal
sanctions. There is no assurance that further inappropriate or unlawful
actions by employees have not occurred or will not occur, lead to a violation
of the terms of these resolutions (and associated consequences), or that any
such actions will always be detected, deterred or prevented.

JPMorgan Chase's reputation could be harmed, and collateral consequences could
result, from a failure by one or more employees to conduct themselves in
accordance with JPMorgan Chase's expectations, policies and practices,
including by acting in ways that harm clients, customers, other market
participants, employees or others. Some examples of this include:

•improperly selling and marketing JPMorgan Chase's products or services

•engaging in insider trading, market manipulation or unauthorized trading

•engaging in improper or fraudulent behavior in connection with government
relief programs

•facilitating a transaction where a material objective is to achieve a
particular tax, accounting or financial disclosure treatment that may be
subject to scrutiny by governmental or regulatory authorities, or where the

proposed treatment is unclear or may not reflect the economic substance of the
transaction

•failing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other duties owed to clients or
customers

•violating antitrust or anti-competition laws by colluding with other market
participants

•using electronic communications channels that have not been approved by
JPMorgan Chase

•engaging in discriminatory behavior or harassment with respect to clients,
customers or employees, or acting contrary to JPMorgan Chase's goal of
fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace

•managing or reporting risks in ways that subordinate JPMorgan Chase's risk
appetite to business performance goals or employee compensation objectives,
and

•misappropriating property, confidential or proprietary information, or
technology assets belonging to JPMorgan Chase, its clients and customers or
third parties.

The consequences of any failure by one or more employees to conduct themselves
in accordance with JPMorgan Chase's expectations, policies or practices could
include litigation, or regulatory or other governmental investigations or
enforcement actions. Any of these proceedings or actions could result in
judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, or lead to:

•financial losses

•increased operational and compliance costs

•greater scrutiny by regulators and other parties

•regulatory actions that require JPMorgan Chase to restructure, curtail or
cease certain of its activities

•the need for significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase's management

•loss of clients or customers, and

•harm to JPMorgan Chase's reputation.

The foregoing risks could be heightened with respect to newly-acquired
businesses if JPMorgan Chase fails to successfully integrate employees of
those businesses or any of those employees do not conduct themselves in
accordance with JPMorgan Chase's expectations, policies and practices.

Reputation

Damage to JPMorgan Chase's reputation could harm its businesses.

Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to its ability to attract and
retain clients, customers, investors and employees. Damage to JPMorgan Chase's
reputation can therefore cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase's

business and prospects, and can arise from numerous sources, including:

•employee misconduct, including discriminatory behavior or harassment with
respect to clients, customers or employees, or actions that are contrary to
JPMorgan Chase's goal of fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace

•security breaches, including as a result of cyber attacks

•failure to safeguard client, customer or employee information

•failure to manage risks associated with its business activities or those of
its clients, including those that may be unpopular among one or more
constituencies

•failure to meet publicly-announced commitments to support ESG initiatives

•non-compliance with laws, rules, and regulations

•operational failures

•litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions

•actions taken in executing regulatory and governmental requirements during a
global or regional health emergency, spread of infectious disease, epidemic or
pandemic

•regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, or resolutions of these
matters, and

•failure or perceived failure to comply with laws, rules or regulations by
JPMorgan Chase or its clients, customers, counterparties or other parties,
including newly-acquired businesses, companies in which JPMorgan Chase has
made principal investments, parties to joint ventures with JPMorgan Chase, and
vendors with which JPMorgan Chase does business.

JPMorgan Chase's reputation may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity
or negative information regarding JPMorgan Chase, whether or not true, that
may be published or broadcast by the media or posted on social media, non-
mainstream news services or other parts of the internet. This latter risk can
be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is
disseminated through those channels.

Social and environmental activists have been increasingly targeting JPMorgan
Chase and other financial services firms with public criticism concerning
their business practices, including business relationships with clients that
are engaged in certain sensitive industries, such as companies :

•whose products are or are perceived to be harmful to human health, or

•whose activities negatively affect or are perceived to negatively affect the
environment, workers' rights or communities.

Activists have also taken actions intended to change or influence JPMorgan
Chase's business practices with respect to ESG matters, including public
protests at JPMorgan Chase's headquarters and other properties, and submitting
specific ESG-related proposals for a vote by JPMorgan Chase's shareholders.

These and other types of activist criticism and actions directed at JPMorgan
Chase could potentially engender dissatisfaction among clients, customers,
investors and employees with how JPMorgan Chase addresses ESG concerns in its
business activities. In all of these cases, the resulting harm to JPMorgan
Chase's reputation could:

•attract scrutiny from governmental or regulatory bodies

•cause certain clients and customers to cease doing business with JPMorgan
Chase

•impair JPMorgan Chase's ability to attract new clients and customers, or to
expand its relationships with existing clients and customers

•diminish JPMorgan Chase's ability to hire or retain employees

•prompt JPMorgan Chase to cease doing business with certain clients or
customers

•cause certain investors to divest from investments in securities of JPMorgan
Chase, or

•otherwise negatively affect JPMorgan Chase's business and results of
operations.

Actions by the financial services industry generally or individuals in the
industry can also affect JPMorgan Chase's reputation. For example, the
reputation of the industry as a whole can be damaged by concerns that:

•consumers have been treated unfairly by a financial institution, or

•a financial institution has acted inappropriately with respect to the methods
used to offer products to customers.

If JPMorgan Chase is perceived to have engaged in these types of behaviors,
this could weaken its reputation among clients or customers.

Failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest or to satisfy
fiduciary obligations can result in litigation and enforcement actions, as
well as damage JPMorgan Chase's reputation.

JPMorgan Chase's ability to manage potential conflicts of interest is highly
complex due to the broad range of its business activities which encompass a
variety of transactions, obligations and interests with and among JPMorgan
Chase's clients and customers. JPMorgan Chase can become subject to
litigation, enforcement actions, and heightened regulatory scrutiny, and its
reputation can be damaged, by the failure or perceived failure to:

| | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
  
30

| |  
  
* * *

  

•adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest, including
potential conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with providing
multiple products and services in, or having one or more investments related
to, the same transaction

•identify and address any conflict of interest that a third party with which
it is does business may have with respect to a transaction involving JPMorgan
Chase

•deliver appropriate standards of service and quality

•treat clients and customers fairly and with the appropriate standard of care

•use client and customer data responsibly and in a manner that meets legal
requirements and regulatory expectations

•provide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the applicable
legal and regulatory standards, or

•handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately
and in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws, rules and
regulations.

A failure or perceived failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest
or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation
and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and heightened regulatory
scrutiny and enforcement actions, all of which can lead to lost revenue and
higher operating costs and cause serious harm to JPMorgan Chase's reputation.

Country

An outbreak or escalation of hostilities between countries or within a country
or region could have a material adverse effect on the global economy and on
JPMorgan Chase's businesses within the affected region or globally.

Aggressive actions by hostile governments or groups, including armed conflict
or intensified cyber attacks, could expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in
other countries or escalating into full-scale war with potentially
catastrophic consequences, particularly if one or more of the combatants
possess nuclear weapons. Depending on the scope of the conflict, the
hostilities could result in:

•worldwide economic disruption

•heightened volatility in financial markets

•severe declines in asset values, accompanied by widespread sell-offs of
investments

•substantial depreciation of local currencies, potentially leading to defaults
by borrowers and counterparties in the affected region

•disruption of global trade, and

•diminished consumer, business and investor confidence.

Any of the above consequences could have significant negative effects on
JPMorgan Chase's operations and

earnings, both in the countries or regions directly affected by the
hostilities or globally. Further, if the U.S. were to become directly involved
in such a conflict, this could lead to a curtailment of any operations that
JPMorgan Chase may have in the affected countries or region, as well as in any
nation that is aligned against the U.S. in the hostilities. JPMorgan Chase
could also experience more numerous and aggressive cyber attacks launched by
or under the sponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such a conflict.

JPMorgan Chase's business and operations in certain countries can be adversely
affected by local economic, political, regulatory and social factors.

Some of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts business have economies
or markets that are less developed and more volatile or may have political,
legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable than
other countries in which JPMorgan Chase operates. In addition, in some
jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase conducts business, the local economy and
business activities are subject to substantial government influence or
control. Some of these countries have in the past experienced economic
disruptions, including:

•extreme currency fluctuations

•high inflation

•low or negative growth, and

•defaults or reduced ability to service sovereign debt.

The governments in these countries have sometimes reacted to these
developments by imposing restrictive policies that adversely affect the local
and regional business environment, such as:

•price, capital or exchange controls, including imposition of punitive
transfer and convertibility restrictions or forced currency exchange

•expropriation or nationalization of assets or confiscation of property,
including intellectual property, and

•changes in laws, rules and regulations.

The impact of these actions could be accentuated in trading markets that are
smaller, less liquid and more volatile than more-developed markets. These
types of government actions can negatively affect JPMorgan Chase's operations
in the relevant country, either directly or by suppressing the business
activities of local clients or multi-national clients that conduct business in
the jurisdiction.

In addition, emerging markets countries, as well as more developed countries,
have been susceptible to unfavorable social developments arising from poor
economic conditions or governmental actions, including:

•widespread demonstrations, civil unrest or general strikes

•crime and corruption

| | | | | | | |

Part I

•security and personal safety issues

•an outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or other geopolitical instabilities

•overthrow of incumbent governments

•terrorist attacks, and

•other forms of internal discord.

These economic, political, regulatory and social developments have in the past
resulted in, and in the future could lead to, conditions that can adversely
affect JPMorgan Chase's operations in those countries and impair the revenues,
growth and profitability of those operations. In addition, any of these events
or circumstances in one country can affect JPMorgan Chase's operations and
investments in another country or countries, including in the U.S.

People

JPMorgan Chase's ability to attract and retain qualified and diverse employees
is critical to its success.

JPMorgan Chase's employees are its most important resource, and in many areas
of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is
intense. JPMorgan Chase endeavors to attract talented and diverse new
employees and retain, develop and motivate its existing employees. JPMorgan
Chase's efforts to retain talented and diverse employees can be particularly
challenging when members of its workforce are targeted for recruitment by
competitors. If JPMorgan Chase were unable to continue to attract or retain
qualified and diverse employees, including successors to the Chief Executive
Officer, members of the Operating Committee and other senior leaders, JPMorgan
Chase's performance, including its competitive position, could be materially
and adversely affected.

JPMorgan Chase's increased use of hybrid work models could result in
deterioration in employee performance or degradation of JPMorgan Chase's
control environment which may have a material and adverse effect on its
business and operations. Alternatively, discontinuing hybrid work models could
harm JPMorgan Chase's ability to attract and retain employees.

Unfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies could adversely affect
JPMorgan Chase's businesses and operations.

JPMorgan Chase relies on the skills, knowledge and expertise of employees
located throughout the world. Changes in immigration or travel policies in the
U.S. and other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise make it more
difficult for employees or their family members to work in, or travel to or
transfer between, jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase has operations or
conducts its business could inhibit JPMorgan Chase's ability to attract and
retain qualified employees, and thereby dilute the quality of its workforce,
or could prompt JPMorgan Chase to

make structural changes to its worldwide or regional operating models that
cause its operations to be less efficient or more costly.

Legal

JPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks from litigation and formal and
informal regulatory and government investigations.

JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in many legal
proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with
third parties. Actions currently pending against JPMorgan Chase may result in
judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions adverse to
JPMorgan Chase. Any of these matters could materially and adversely affect
JPMorgan Chase's business, financial condition or results of operations, or
cause serious reputational harm. As a participant in the financial services
industry, it is likely that JPMorgan Chase will continue to experience a high
level of litigation and regulatory and government investigations related to
its businesses and operations.

Regulators and other government agencies conduct examinations of JPMorgan
Chase and its subsidiaries both on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and
JPMorgan Chase's businesses and operations are subject to heightened
regulatory oversight. This heightened regulatory scrutiny, or the results of
such an investigation or examination, may lead to additional regulatory
investigations or enforcement actions. There is no assurance that those
actions will not result in resolutions or other enforcement actions against
JPMorgan Chase. Furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation of
law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and
proceedings, either by multiple federal, state or local agencies and officials
in the U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials
in non-U.S. jurisdictions.

If another financial institution violates a law or regulation relating to a
particular business activity or practice, this will often give rise to an
investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or
similar activity or practice by JPMorgan Chase.

These and other initiatives by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental authorities may
subject JPMorgan Chase to judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other
sanctions, and may require JPMorgan Chase to restructure its operations and
activities or to cease offering certain products or services. All of these
potential outcomes could harm JPMorgan Chase's reputation or lead to higher
operational costs, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase's profitability, or result
in collateral consequences. In addition, the extent of JPMorgan Chase's
exposure to legal and regulatory matters can be unpredictable and could, in
some cases, exceed the amount of reserves that JPMorgan Chase has established
for those matters.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

The internal control framework promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"), "Internal Control --
Integrated Framework" ("COSO 2013"), provides guidance for designing,
implementing and conducting internal control and assessing its effectiveness.
The Firm used the COSO 2013 framework to assess the effectiveness of the
Firm's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.
Refer to "Management's report on internal control over financial reporting" on
page 155.

As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried
out under the supervision and with the participation of the Firm's management,
including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on
that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were
effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certifications furnished by
the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
respectively.

The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over
financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all
misstatements. Deficiencies or lapses in internal controls may occur from time
to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not
result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control
in the future and collateral consequences therefrom. Refer to "Management's
report on internal control over financial reporting" on page 155 for further
information. There was no change in the Firm's internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934) that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2022, that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to

materially affect, the Firm's internal control over financial reporting.

Item 9B. Other Information.

None.

Item 9C. Disclosure regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections.

Firmwide overview

JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $37.7 billion for 2022, down 22%,
earnings per share of $12.09, ROE of 14% and ROTCE of 18%.

•Total net revenue was $128.7 billion, up 6%, reflecting:

-Net interest income of $66.7 billion, up 28%, driven by higher rates and loan growth, partially offset by lower Markets net interest income. Net interest income excluding Markets was $62.4 billion, up 40%. 

  

-Noninterest revenue of $62.0 billion, down 11%, driven by lower Investment Banking fees, $2.4 billion of net investment securities losses in Treasury and CIO, lower net production revenue in Home Lending and lower auto operating lease income, largely offset by higher CIB Markets revenue and a $914 million gain on the sale of Visa Class B common shares ("Visa B shares") in Corporate.

•Noninterest expense was $76.1 billion, up 7%, driven by higher structural
expense and continued investments in the business, including compensation,
technology and marketing, partially offset by lower volume- and revenue-
related expense.

•The provision for credit losses was $6.4 billion, reflecting:

-a net addition of $3.5 billion to the allowance for credit losses, consisting of $2.3 billion in wholesale and $1.2 billion in consumer, driven by loan growth and deterioration in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede, and

-$2.9 billion of net charge-offs.

The prior year provision was a net benefit of $9.3 billion, reflecting a net
reduction to the allowance for credit losses of $12.1 billion.

•The total allowance for credit losses was $22.2 billion at December 31, 2022.
The Firm had an allowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of
1.81%, compared with 1.62% in the prior year.

•The Firm's nonperforming assets totaled $7.2 billion at December 31, 2022, a
net decrease of $1.1 billion, predominantly driven by lower consumer
nonaccrual loans, reflecting improved credit performance and loan sales.

•Firmwide average loans of $1.1 trillion were up 6%, driven by higher loans
across the LOBs.

•Firmwide average deposits of $2.5 trillion were up 5%, reflecting:

-growth in CCB from existing and new accounts, and net inflows in AWM resulting from the residual effects of certain government actions, partially offset by the impact of growth in customer spending in CCB and migration into investments in AWM, and

-reductions in CIB and CB due to attrition driven by the rising interest rate environment. 

Selected capital and other metrics

•CET1 capital was $219 billion, and the Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios
were 13.2% and 13.6%, respectively.

•SLR was 5.6%.

•TBVPS grew by 2%, ending 2022 at $73.12.

Management's discussion and analysis

Business Developments

War in Ukraine

The duration and potential outcomes of the war in Ukraine remain uncertain.
The Firm has taken and continues to take steps to close positions and reduce
certain of its business activities and exposures connected with the war, and
to assist clients with fulfilling any pre-existing obligations and managing
their Russia-related risks.

The Firm's exposure to Russia and Russia-associated clients and counterparties
is not material to its financial condition or results of operations. However,
the Firm continues to monitor potential secondary impacts of the war,
including increased market volatility, inflationary pressures and the effects
of financial and economic sanctions imposed by various governments, that could
have adverse effects on the Firm's businesses.

The Firm also continues to monitor and manage the operational risks associated
with the war, including compliance with the financial and economic sanctions
and the increased risk of cyber attacks.

Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 116-126, Allowance for Credit
Losses on pages 127-129, Market Risk Management on pages 131-138, Country Risk
Management on pages 139-140 and Operational Risk Management on pages 142-144
for additional information.

For purposes of this Form 10-K, "Russia" refers to exposure to clients and
counterparties of the Firm for which the largest proportion of their assets is
located, or the largest proportion of their revenue is derived, in Russia,
based on the Firm's internal country risk management framework; and "Russia-
associated" refers to exposure to clients and counterparties of the Firm with
respect to which economic or financial sanctions relating to the war in
Ukraine have been imposed or which have close association with Russia.

Interbank Offered Rate ("IBOR") transition

The Firm and other market participants are preparing for the final stages of
the transition from the use of the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") and
other IBORs in accordance with the International Organization of Securities
Commission's standards for transaction-based benchmark rates. The cessation of
the publication of the remaining principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e.,
overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month LIBOR) ("LIBOR
Cessation") is scheduled for June 30, 2023.

As of December 31, 2022, the Firm had significantly reduced the notional
amount of its exposure to contracts that reference U.S. dollar LIBOR,
including in derivatives, bilateral and syndicated loans, securities, and debt
and preferred stock issuances, and is on-track to meet both its internal
milestones for contract remediation as well as the industry milestones and
recommendations published by National Working Groups, including the
Alternative Reference Rates Committee in the U.S. The Firm also continues to
engage with clients to assist them with transitioning their U.S. dollar LIBOR-
linked contracts to replacement rates in anticipation of LIBOR Cessation. The
majority of the Firm's remaining LIBOR exposure is to derivative contracts.
The Firm will be participating in initiatives by the principal central
counterparties ("CCPs") to convert cleared derivatives contracts linked to
U.S. dollar LIBOR in the second quarter of 2023 which will remediate
approximately 40% of the Firm's remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR derivatives
exposure. The Firm expects that the majority of the remaining derivatives
exposure will be remediated predominantly through contractual fallback
provisions.

On March 15, 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act ("LIBOR Act") was
signed into law in the U.S. The LIBOR Act provides a framework for replacing
U.S. dollar LIBOR as the reference rate in legacy financial contracts that may
not otherwise transition to a replacement rate upon LIBOR Cessation. In
addition, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority is proposing that the
administrator of LIBOR be required to continue to publish the one-month,
three-month and six-month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR on a "synthetic" basis
which would allow market participants to use such rates through September 30,
2024. This proposal would apply to contracts that are outside the scope of the
LIBOR Act, including U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked contracts that are not governed
by U.S. law. Both the LIBOR Act and the proposed publication of "synthetic"
LIBOR are intended to facilitate, and reduce the risks associated with, the
transition from LIBOR, including the potential for disputes or litigation.

The Firm continues to make necessary changes to its risk management systems in
connection with the transition from LIBOR, including modifications to its
operational systems and models. In addition, the Firm continues to monitor and
evaluate client, industry, market, regulatory and legislative developments
relating to the transition from LIBOR. Refer to Part 1, Item 1A: Risk Factors
on pages 9-32 of the 2022 Form 10-K and to Accounting and Reporting
Developments on page 153 for additional information.

additional information.

2022 compared with 2021

Investment banking fees decreased in CIB, as volatile market conditions
resulted in:

•lower equity and debt underwriting fees due to lower issuance activity, and

•lower advisory fees driven by a lower level of announced deals.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 67-72 and Note 6 for additional
information.

Principal transactions revenue increased, reflecting:

•higher net revenue in Fixed Income Markets, driven by a strong performance in
the macro businesses amid volatile market conditions, particularly Currencies
& Emerging Markets and Rates, partially offset by lower revenue in Securitized
Products and Credit, and

•higher revenue associated with Equity Derivatives and Prime Finance in Equity
Markets,

  

largely offset by

•a loss of $836 million in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB, compared with a
gain of $250 million in the prior year. The loss in the current year reflected
funding spread widening and, to a lesser extent, losses on exposures relating
to commodities and Russia and Russia-associated counterparties,

•net markdowns recorded in the second quarter of 2022 on held-for-sale
positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio
in CIB and CB,

•higher net losses on certain legacy private equity investments in Corporate,
and

•net losses in Treasury and CIO related to cash deployment transactions, which
were more than offset by the related net interest income earned on those
transactions.

Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain cases have offsets across
other revenue lines, including net interest income. The Firm assesses the
performance of its CIB Markets business on a total revenue basis.

Refer to CIB, CB and Corporate segment results on pages 67-72, pages 73-75 and
pages 79-80, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information.

Lending- and deposit-related fees increased due to higher service fee volume
in CCB, predominantly offset by lower cash management fees in CB and CIB due
to a higher level of credits earned by clients and applied against such fees.
Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages 63-66, pages 67-72 and pages
73-75, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information.

Asset management, administration and commissions revenue decreased driven by:

•lower asset management fees in AWM resulting from lower average market
levels, predominantly offset by the removal of most money market fund fee
waivers, and net long-term inflows,

•lower custody fees in Securities Services, primarily associated with lower
average market values of assets under custody, and

•lower brokerage commissions, largely in AWM, reflecting reduced volumes,

partially offset by

•higher commissions on travel-related services and annuity sales in CCB.

Refer to CCB, CIB and AWM segment results on pages 63-66, pages 67-72 and
pages 76-78, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information.

Management's discussion and analysis

Investment securities gains/(losses) reflected higher net losses on sales of
U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and U.S. Treasuries, associated with
repositioning the investment securities portfolio in Treasury and CIO. Refer
to Corporate segment results on pages 79-80 and Note 10 for additional
information.

Mortgage fees and related income decreased driven by Home Lending, reflecting:

•lower production revenue due to lower margins and volume,

largely offset by

•higher net mortgage servicing revenue, reflecting

-the absence of a net loss in MSR risk management in the prior year primarily driven by updates to model inputs related to prepayment expectations, and

-higher operating revenue due to a higher level of third-party loans serviced.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 63-66, Note 6 and 15 for further
information.

Card income decreased driven by higher amortization related to new account
origination costs, partially offset by higher annual fees in CCB, and higher
payments revenue on volume growth in commercial cards in CIB and CB.

Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages 63-66, pages 67-72 and pages
73-75, respectively, and Note 6 for further information.

Other income decreased reflecting:

•lower auto operating lease income in CCB as a result of a decline in volume,
and

•net losses on certain investments in CIB and AWM, compared with net gains in
the prior year,

partially offset by

•an increase in Other Corporate from:

-a gain of $914M on the sale of Visa B shares,

-higher net gains related to certain other investments, and

-proceeds from an insurance settlement in the first quarter of 2022,

•a gain on an equity-method investment received in partial satisfaction of a
loan in CB,

•the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates related to net investment
hedges in Treasury and CIO, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the
U.S. dollar, and

•the absence of weather-related write-downs recorded in the prior year on
certain renewable energy investments in CIB.

Refer to Note 2 for additional information on Visa B shares.

Net interest income increased driven by higher rates and loan growth,
partially offset by lower Markets NII.

The Firm's average interest-earning assets were $3.3 trillion, up $133
billion, and the yield was 2.78%, up 97 basis points ("bps"). The net yield on
these assets, on an FTE basis, was 2.00%, an increase of 36 bps. The net yield
excluding Markets was 2.60%, up 69 bps.

Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and rates schedule
on pages 292-296 for further information. Net yield excluding Markets is a
non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the
Firm's Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 58-60 for a further
discussion of Net yield excluding Markets.

Total provision for credit losses

| $| 6,389 | | | $| (9,256)| | | $| 17,480 |  
  
2022 compared with 2021

The provision for credit losses was $6.4 billion, reflecting a net addition of
$3.5 billion to the allowance for credit losses and $2.9 billion of net
charge-offs. The net addition to the allowance for credit losses consisted of:

•$2.3 billion in wholesale, driven by deterioration in the Firm's
macroeconomic outlook, and loan growth predominantly in CB and CIB, and

•$1.2 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting
higher outstanding balances and deterioration in the Firm's macroeconomic
outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a
decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of
the pandemic gradually recede.

The prior year included a $12.1 billion net reduction in the allowance for
credit losses.

Deterioration in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook included both updates to the
central scenario in the fourth quarter of 2022, which now reflects a mild
recession, as well as the impact of the increased weight placed on the adverse
scenarios beginning in the first quarter of 2022 due to the effects associated
with higher inflation, changes in monetary policy, and geopolitical risks,
including the war in Ukraine.

  

Net charge-offs were $2.9 billion, flat compared with 2021, and included:

•a $309 million decrease in Card Services, reflecting the ongoing financial
strength of U.S. consumers. However, median deposit balances declined in the
second half of 2022, impacted by the growth in consumer spending,

offset by

•a $190 million increase in net charge-offs in Auto and Banking & Wealth
Management ("BWM") as net charge-offs in the prior year benefited from
government stimulus and payment assistance programs, and an increase of $76
million in CIB.

Refer to the segment discussions of CCB on pages 63-66, CIB on pages 67-72, CB
on pages 73-75, AWM on pages 76-78, the Allowance for Credit Losses on pages
127-129, and Notes 1, 10 and 13 for further discussion of the credit portfolio
and the allowance for credit losses.

(b)Included Firmwide legal expense of $266 million, $426 million and $1.1
billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

2022 compared with 2021

Compensation expense increased driven by additional headcount, primarily in
technology and operations, as well as front office, and the impact of
inflation, partially offset by lower revenue-related compensation in CIB.

Noncompensation expense increased as a result of:

•higher investments in the business, including marketing and technology, and

•higher structural expense, including travel and entertainment; regulatory
assessments; occupancy expense associated with higher utilities and exit costs
of certain leases; and other employee-related expense,

partially offset by

•lower volume-related expense, reflecting lower depreciation expense on lower
Auto lease assets; and lower distribution fees in AWM, partially offset by
higher operating losses and outside services, both in CCB; and

•lower legal expense.

The prior year included a $550 million contribution to the Firm's Foundation.

Effective tax rate| 18.4 | %| | 18.9 | %| | 18.7 | %|  
  
2022 compared with 2021

The effective tax rate decreased driven by income tax benefits compared with
income tax expense in the prior year related to tax audit settlements, largely
offset by other tax adjustments and a change in the level and mix of income
and expenses subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes. Refer to Note
25 for further information.

Total assets| $| 3,665,743 | | | $| 3,743,567 | | (2)| %  
  
Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks decreased primarily as a
result of lower deposits across the LOBs and loan growth. Deposits with banks
reflect the Firm's placement of its excess cash with various central banks,
including the Federal Reserve Banks.

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements increased,
reflecting:

•the impact of a lower level of netting on client-driven market-making
activities and on collateral requirements in Markets,

•higher demand for securities to cover short positions in Fixed Income
Markets, and

•an increase in the deployment of cash in Treasury and CIO.

Securities borrowed decreased driven by Markets, reflecting lower client-
driven activities and lower demand for securities to cover short positions in
Equity Markets.

Refer to Note 11 for additional information on securities purchased under
resale agreements and securities borrowed.

Trading assets increased due to:

•higher derivative receivables, primarily in foreign exchange, as a result of
market movements, and

•an increase in the deployment of cash in Treasury and CIO.

Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional information.

Investment securities decreased, driven by lower available-for-sale ("AFS")
securities, partially offset by higher held-to-maturity ("HTM") securities,
which includes the impact of the transfer of $78.3 billion of securities from
AFS to HTM in 2022, for capital management purposes.

•The decrease in AFS securities was also due to paydowns, as well as
unrealized losses, which are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive
income ("AOCI"),

largely offset by net purchases, and

•the increase in HTM securities also reflected purchases partially offset by
paydowns.

Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 79-80, Investment Portfolio Risk
Management on page 130 and Notes 2 and 10 for additional information on
investment securities.

Loans increased, reflecting:

•higher balances in Card Services driven by higher consumer spending and net
new originations,

•higher originations and revolver utilization in CB, and

•higher wholesale loans in CIB,

partially offset by

•lower mortgage warehouse loans in Home Lending as sales outpaced originations
due to higher interest rates, and

•the impact from PPP loan forgiveness in BWM.

The allowance for loan losses increased, reflecting a net addition of $3.3
billion to the allowance for loan losses, consisting of:

•$2.1 billion in wholesale, resulting from deterioration in the Firm's
macroeconomic outlook, and loan growth predominantly in CB and CIB, and

•$1.2 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting
higher outstanding balances, and deterioration in the Firm's macroeconomic
outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a
decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of
the pandemic gradually recede.

There was also a $121 million addition to the allowance for lending-related
commitments recognized in other liabilities

Management's discussion and analysis

on the Consolidated balance sheets, and a $54 million addition to the
allowance for investment securities.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 106-130, and Notes 1,
2, 3, 12 and 13 for further discussion of loans and the allowance for loan
losses.

Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased due to higher client
receivables related to client-driven activities in Markets, as well as higher
receivables in Payments related to the timing of payment activities, with
December 31, 2022 falling on a weekend.

Premises and equipment, refer to Note 16 and 18 for additional information.

Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles increased reflecting:

•higher MSRs as a result of higher market interest rates and net additions,
partially offset by the realization of expected cash flows, and

•additions to goodwill associated with the acquisitions of Renovite
Technologies, Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2022, Global Shares PLC and Figg,
Inc. in the third quarter of 2022, and Frosch Travel Group, LLC and Volkswagen
Payments S.A. in the second quarter of 2022.

Refer to Note 15 for additional information.

Other assets increased predominantly due to the impact of securities financing
activities in Markets, offset by lower auto operating lease assets in CCB.

Total liabilities and stockholders' equity

| $| 3,665,743 | | | $| 3,743,567 | | (2)| %  
  
Deposits decreased reflecting:

•attrition in CB and CIB, particularly non-operating deposits in CB, partially
offset by net issuances of structured notes in Markets,

•net outflows into investments in AWM amid the rising interest rate
environment, and

•a decline in balances in existing accounts in CCB due to higher customer
spending, predominantly offset by net inflows into new accounts.

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase
agreements increased due to:

•higher secured financing of trading assets in Markets,

partially offset by

•lower secured financing of AFS investment securities in Treasury and CIO.

Short-term borrowings decreased predominantly as a result of lower financing
requirements in Markets.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 for additional information
on deposits, federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements, and short-term borrowings; and also to Notes 2 and 17
for deposits and Note 11 for federal funds purchased and securities loaned or
sold under repurchase agreements.

Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven market-making activities,
which resulted in higher levels of short positions in Markets. Refer to Notes
2 and 5 for additional information.

Accounts payable and other liabilities increased due to higher client payables
related to client-driven activities in Markets, including Prime Finance, as
well as higher payables in Payments related to the timing of payment
activities, with December 31, 2022 falling on a weekend. Refer to Note 19 for
additional information.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs increased driven by higher
issuance of commercial paper as a result of an increase in loan balances in
the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. Refer to Liquidity Risk
Management on pages 97-104; and Notes 14 and 28 for additional information on
Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts.

Long-term debt decreased driven by:

•fair value hedge accounting adjustments in Treasury and CIO as a result of
higher rates, and a decline in the fair value of structured notes in Markets,

largely offset by

•net issuances of senior debt in Treasury and CIO and structured notes in
Markets. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 and Note 20 for
additional information.

Stockholders' equity reflects net unrealized losses in AOCI, predominantly
driven by the impact of higher interest rates on the AFS portfolio and cash
flow hedges in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Consolidated Statements of Changes
in Stockholders' Equity on page 162, Capital Actions on page 94, and Note 24
for additional information.

Operating activities

JPMorgan Chase's operating assets and liabilities primarily support the Firm's
lending and capital markets activities. These assets and liabilities can vary
significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of
cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk management activities
and market conditions. The Firm believes that cash flows from operations,
available cash and other liquidity sources, and its capacity to generate cash
through secured and unsecured sources, are sufficient to meet its operating
liquidity needs.

•In 2022, cash provided resulted from higher accounts payable and other
liabilities, lower securities borrowed, and net proceeds from sales,
securitizations, and paydowns of loans held-for-sale, partially offset by
higher trading assets.

•In 2021, cash provided resulted from lower trading assets and higher accounts
payable and other liabilities, partially offset by higher securities borrowed
and lower trading liabilities.

Investing activities

The Firm's investing activities predominantly include originating held-for-
investment loans, investing in the investment securities portfolio and other
short-term instruments.

•In 2022, cash used resulted from net originations of loans and higher
securities purchased under resale agreements, partially offset by net proceeds
from investment securities.

•In 2021, cash used resulted from net purchases of investment securities and
higher net originations of loans, partially offset by lower securities
purchased under resale agreements.

Financing activities

The Firm's financing activities include acquiring customer deposits and
issuing long-term debt and preferred stock.

•In 2022, cash used reflected lower deposits, partially offset by net proceeds
from long- and short-term borrowings.

•In 2021, cash provided reflected higher deposits and net proceeds from long-
and short-term borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in securities loaned
or sold under repurchase agreements.

•For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of common stock and cash
dividends on common and preferred stock.

Management's discussion and analysis

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM'S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL
MEASURES  
  
Non-GAAP financial measures

The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with
U.S. GAAP; these financial statements appear on pages 159-163. That
presentation, which is referred to as "reported" basis, provides the reader
with an understanding of the Firm's results that can be tracked consistently
from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm's performance with the
U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies.

In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, management
reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a "managed" basis;
these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm
also reviews the results of the LOBs on a managed basis. The Firm's definition
of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and
includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm
(and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly,
revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is
presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments
and securities. These financial measures allow

management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising
from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact
related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These
adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or
by the LOBs.

Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the Firm and
business-segment level because these other non-GAAP financial measures provide
information to investors about the underlying operational performance and
trends of the Firm or of the particular business segment, as the case may be,
and therefore facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business segment with
the performance of its relevant competitors. Refer to Business Segment Results
on pages 61-80 for additional information on these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP
financial measures used by the Firm may not be comparable to similarly named
non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.

  

  

The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm's reported
U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest revenue excluding CIB Markets

In addition to reviewing net interest income, net yield, and noninterest
revenue on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding
CIB Markets, as shown below. CIB Markets consists of Fixed Income Markets and
Equity Markets. These metrics, which exclude CIB Markets, are non-GAAP
financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance
of the Firm's lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and
deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with CIB
Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses CIB Markets business
performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue
lines. Management believes that these measures provide investors and analysts
with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm.

In addition, the Firm reviews other non-GAAP measures such as

•Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest expense excluding Firmwide
legal expense, and

•Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue less total
noninterest expense.

Management believes that these measures help investors understand the effect
of these items on reported results and provide an alternative presentation of
the Firm's performance.

The Firm also reviews the allowance for loan losses to period-end loans
retained excluding trade finance and conduits, a non-GAAP financial measure,
to provide a more meaningful assessment of CIB's allowance coverage ratio.

Management's discussion and analysis

TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS

TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the
Firm's common stockholders' equity (i.e., total stockholders' equity less
preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than
MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm's net
income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS
represents the Firm's TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-
end. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and
analysts, in assessing the Firm's use of equity.

The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm's common
stockholders' equity to TCE.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS  
  
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business
segments - Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank,
Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a
Corporate segment.

The business segments are determined based on the products and services
provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which
financial information is evaluated by the Firm's Operating Committee. Segment
results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and
Reconciliation of the Firm's use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, on pages
58-60 for a definition of managed basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology

Results of the business segments are intended to present each segment as if it
were a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives
business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense
items. The Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at
least an annual basis. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions,
methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and
further refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm's LOBs also
provide various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its
investors and analysts in assessing performance.

Revenue sharing

When business segments join efforts to sell products and services to the
Firm's clients and customers, the participating business segments may agree to
share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the
segment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to
the other segment(s) involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect
these revenue-sharing agreements.

Expense Allocation

Where business segments use services provided by corporate support units, or
another business segment, the costs of those services are allocated to the
respective business segments. The expense is generally

allocated based on the actual cost and use of services provided. In contrast,
certain costs and investments related to corporate support units, technology
and operations that are not currently utilized by any LOB, are not allocated
to the business segments and are retained in Corporate. Expense retained in
Corporate generally includes costs that would not be incurred if the segments
were stand-alone businesses, and other items not aligned with a particular
business segment.

Funds transfer pricing

Funds transfer pricing ("FTP") is the process by which the Firm allocates
interest income and expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the
primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.

The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity
risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products.
Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process are
adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact
the allocation of net interest income to the segments.

As a result of the rising interest rate environment, the cost of funds for
assets and the credits earned for liabilities have generally increased,
impacting the business segments' net interest income. During the period ended
December 31, 2022, this has resulted in higher cost of funds for loans and
contributed to margin expansion on deposits.

Management's discussion and analysis

Foreign exchange risk

Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and Other Corporate to
Treasury and CIO for certain revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages
these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate
movements related to the transferred risk in its results. Refer to Market Risk
Management on page 137 for additional information.

Debt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation

As part of the funds transfer pricing process, almost all of the cost of the
credit spread component of outstanding unsecured long-term debt and preferred
stock dividends is allocated to the reportable business segments, while the
balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The methodology to allocate the
cost of unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends to the business
segments is aligned with the relevant regulatory capital requirements and
funding needs of the LOBs, as applicable. The allocated cost of unsecured
long-term debt is included in a business segment's net interest income, and
net income is reduced by preferred stock dividends to arrive at a

business segment's net income applicable to common equity.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for additional information.

Capital allocation

The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as
equity. The Firm's allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized
Risk-weighted assets ("RWA"), Basel III Advanced RWA, the global systemically
important banks ("GSIB") surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe
stress environment. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and
methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the
capital allocated to the LOBs may change. As of January 1, 2023, the Firm has
changed its line of business capital allocations primarily as a result of
updates to the Firm's capital requirements and changes in RWA for each LOB.

Refer to Line of business equity on page 93 for additional information on
capital allocation.

Management's discussion and analysis

2022 compared with 2021

Net income was $14.9 billion, down 29%, reflecting a net increase in the
provision for credit losses compared with a net benefit in the prior year.

Net revenue was $55.0 billion, an increase of 10%.

Net interest income was $39.9 billion, up 22%, predominantly driven by:

•margin expansion on higher rates as well as growth in deposits in Banking &
Wealth Management ("BWM"), and higher revolving loans in Card Services,

partially offset by

•lower NII associated with PPP loan forgiveness in BWM, and tighter loan
spreads in Home Lending.

Noninterest revenue was $15.1 billion, down 13%, reflecting:

•lower production revenue from lower margins and volume in Home Lending,

•lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline in volume, and

•lower card income reflecting higher amortization related to new account
origination costs partially offset by higher annual fees in Card Services,
while net interchange income was relatively flat,

partially offset by

•higher net mortgage servicing revenue, reflecting the absence of a net loss
in MSR risk management in the prior year primarily driven by updates to model
inputs related to prepayment expectations, as well as higher operating revenue
on a higher level of third-party loans serviced,

•higher commissions reflecting travel-related services in Card Services and
increased annuity sales in BWM, and

•higher deposit-related fees due to higher service fee volume in BWM.

Refer to Note 6 for additional information on card income and asset
management, administration and commissions.

Refer to Note 15 for further information regarding changes in the value of the
MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage fees and related income.

Noninterest expense was $31.5 billion, up 8%, reflecting:

•investments in the business and higher structural expenses, predominantly
driven by compensation, technology and marketing,

partially offset by

•lower volume- and revenue-related expenses, predominantly driven by lower
depreciation expense on lower auto lease assets, partially offset by higher
operating losses.

The provision for credit losses was $3.8 billion, driven by:

•net charge-offs of $2.7 billion, down from $2.8 billion in the prior year and
included

-a $309 million decrease in Card Services, reflecting the ongoing financial strength of U.S. consumers. However, median deposit balances declined in the second half of 2022, impacted by the growth in consumer spending,

largely offset by

-a $190 million increase in net charge-offs in Auto and BWM as net charge-offs in the prior year benefited from government stimulus and payment assistance programs, and

•a $1.1 billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses driven by

-$950 million in Card Services, reflecting higher outstanding balances, and deterioration in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede, and

-$175 million in Home Lending.

The prior year included a $9.8 billion reduction in the

allowance for credit losses across CCB.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 106-130 and Allowance
for Credit Losses on pages 127-129 for a further discussion of the credit
portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.

Management's discussion and analysis

2022 compared with 2021

Net income was $15.0 billion, down 29%.

Net revenue was $47.9 billion, down 7%.

Banking revenue was $15.3 billion, down 23%.

•Investment Banking revenue was $6.5 billion, down 48%, driven by lower
Investment Banking fees, which were also down 48%, as volatile market
conditions resulted in lower fees across products, and $251 million of
markdowns on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the
bridge financing portfolio in the second quarter of 2022. The Firm ranked #1
for Global Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic.

-Equity underwriting fees were $1.0 billion, down 74%, and debt underwriting fees were $2.8 billion, down 43%, due to lower issuance activity. 

-Advisory fees were $3.1 billion, down 30%, driven by a lower level of announced deals.

•Payments revenue was $7.4 billion, up 18%, and included the net impact of
equity investments. Excluding this net impact, revenue was $7.8 billion, up
33%, driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates and growth in fees on
higher volumes.

•Lending revenue was $1.4 billion, up 38%, driven by higher net interest
income primarily on higher loans, as well as fair value gains on hedges of
retained loans, compared with losses in the prior year.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $32.6 billion, up 2%. Markets
revenue was $29.0 billion, up 6%.

•Fixed Income Markets revenue was $18.6 billion, up 10%, driven by strong
performance in the macro businesses amid volatile market conditions,
particularly in Currencies & Emerging Markets and Rates, partially offset by
lower revenue in Securitized Products.

•Equity Markets revenue was $10.4 billion, down 2%, driven by lower revenue in
Cash Equities, largely offset by Equity Derivatives.

•Securities Services revenue was $4.5 billion, up 4%, driven by deposit margin
expansion on higher rates and growth in fees, largely offset by lower average
market values of assets under custody and lower deposits.

•Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $836 million, reflecting funding
spread widening, and, to a lesser extent, losses on exposures relating to
commodities and Russia and Russia-associated counterparties, compared with a
gain of $250 million in the prior year.

Noninterest expense was $27.1 billion, up 7%, driven by higher structural
expense and investments in the business, including higher compensation,
partially offset by lower revenue-related compensation as well as lower legal
expense.

The provision for credit losses was $1.2 billion, predominantly driven by a
net addition to the allowance for credit losses, reflecting deterioration in
the Firm's macroeconomic outlook and loan growth.

The provision for credit losses in the prior year was a net benefit of $1.2
billion, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit losses.

Markets revenue

The following table summarizes selected income statement data for the Markets
businesses. Markets includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets.
Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and
other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets
business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across
revenue line items. For example, securities that generate net interest income
may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in
principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for a description of
the composition of these income statement line items.

Principal transactions reflects revenue on financial instruments and
commodities transactions that arise from client-driven market-making activity.
Principal transactions revenue includes amounts recognized upon executing new
transactions with market participants, as well as "inventory-related revenue",
which is revenue recognized from gains and losses on derivatives and other
instruments that the Firm has been holding in anticipation of, or in response
to, client demand, and changes in the fair value of instruments used by the
Firm to actively manage the risk exposure arising from such inventory.
Principal transactions revenue recognized upon executing new transactions with
market participants is affected by many factors including the level of client
activity, the bid-offer spread (which is the

difference between the price at which a market participant is willing and able
to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which another market
participant is willing and able to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa),
market liquidity and volatility. These factors are interrelated and sensitive
to the same factors that drive inventory-related revenue, which include
general market conditions, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates,
credit spreads, and equity and commodity prices, as well as other
macroeconomic conditions.

net revenue. The loss days determined under this measure differ from the
measure used to determine backtesting gains and losses. Daily backtesting
gains and losses include positions in the Firm's Risk Management value-at-risk
("VaR") measure and exclude certain components of total net revenue, which may
more than offset backtesting gains or losses on a particular day. For more
information on daily backtesting gains and losses, refer to the VaR discussion
on pages 133-135.

(a)Includes card income of $685 million, $624 million and $525 million for the

(b)Total net revenue included tax-equivalent adjustments from income tax
credits related to equity investments in designated community development
entities and in entities established for rehabilitation of historic
properties, as well as tax-exempt income related to municipal financing
activities of $322 million, $330 million and $350 million for the years ended
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

  

2022 compared with 2021

Net income was $4.2 billion, down 20%, reflecting a net increase in the
provision for credit losses compared with a net benefit in the prior year.

Net revenue was $11.5 billion, up 15%. Net interest income was $8.2 billion,
up 35%, driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates and growth in
loans, predominantly offset by the impact of higher funding costs and lower
deposits.

Noninterest revenue was $3.3 billion, down 15%, driven by lower investment
banking revenue and net markdowns on held-for-sale positions, primarily
unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio. The decreases were
partially offset by a gain on an equity method investment received in partial
satisfaction of a loan.

Noninterest expense was $4.7 billion, up 17%, largely driven by higher volume-
and revenue-related expense, as well as structural expense, including higher
compensation expense, and expense associated with growth in payments.

The provision for credit losses was $1.3 billion, predominantly driven by a
net addition to the allowance for credit losses, reflecting deterioration in
the Firm's macroeconomic outlook and loan growth.

The provision for credit losses in the prior year was a net benefit of $947
million, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit losses.

Management's discussion and analysis

| | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
  
CB product revenue consists of the following:

Lending includes a variety of financing alternatives, which are primarily
provided on a secured basis; collateral includes receivables, inventory,
equipment, real estate or other assets. Products include term loans, revolving
lines of credit, bridge financing, asset-based structures, leases, and standby
letters of credit.

Payments includes revenue from a broad range of products and services that CB
clients use to manage payments and receipts globally, as well as invest and
manage funds.

Investment banking includes investment banking fees and markets revenue from a
full range of products and services providing CB clients with advisory, loan
syndications, capital-raising in equity and debt markets, and risk management
solutions.

Other revenue primarily includes tax-equivalent adjustments generated from
Community Development Banking and activity derived from principal
transactions.

2022 compared with 2021

Net income was $4.4 billion, down 8%.

Net revenue was $17.7 billion, up 5%. Net interest income was $5.2 billion, up
35%. Noninterest revenue was $12.5 billion, down 4%.

Revenue from Asset Management was $8.8 billion, down 5%, predominantly driven
by:

•net investment valuation losses compared to net gains in the prior year and,

•lower asset management fees reflecting a decline in market levels and the
impact of net liquidity outflows, predominantly offset by the removal of most
money market fund fee waivers.

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $8.9 billion, up 16%, driven by:

•margin expansion on higher rates and higher average deposits; and to a lesser
extent higher average loans and wider spreads,

partially offset by

•lower brokerage and placement fees on reduced volume, and lower management
fees.

Noninterest expense was $11.8 billion, up 8%, driven by higher structural
expense and investments in the business, largely compensation.

The provision for credit losses was $128 million, driven by a net addition to
the allowance for credit losses.

The provision for credit losses in the prior year was a net benefit of $227
million driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit losses.

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its overall fund performance.  
  
• Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds rated 4- or
5-star: Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on their risk adjusted
performance over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and
represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating
represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating
represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating
represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is
the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industrywide ranked funds.
An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average of the
performance associated with a fund's three-, five and ten- year (if
applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate
star ratings are provided at the individual share

class level. The Nomura "star rating" is based on three-year risk-adjusted
performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated
and hence excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer
categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from
the applicable fund rating provider. Where applicable, the fund rating
providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM
is based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds,
and at a "primary share class" level to represent the star rating of all other
funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund level.
The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been
included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.  
  
• Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds ranked in the 1st
or 2nd quartile (one, three and five years):All quartile rankings, the
assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings
are sourced from the fund rating providers. Quartile rankings are based on the
net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating
providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM
is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class
level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a "primary share class" level to represent
the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong SAR funds and at the
fund level for all other funds. The performance data may have been different
if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of
future results.  
  
"Primary share class" means the C share class for European funds and Acc share
class for Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not
available, the oldest share class is used as the primary share class.

Management's discussion and analysis

Client assets

2022 compared with 2021

Client assets were $4.0 trillion, a decrease of 6%. Assets under management
were $2.8 trillion, a decrease of 11% driven by lower market levels and net
outflows from liquidity products, partially offset by continued net inflows
into long term products.

2022 compared with 2021

Net loss was $743 million, compared with a net loss of $3.7 billion in the
prior year.

Net revenue was $80 million, compared with a loss of $3.5 billion driven by
higher net interest income due to higher rates, partially offset by lower
noninterest revenue.

Noninterest revenue was a loss of $1.8 billion, compared with a gain of $68
million driven by:

•higher net investment securities losses on sales of U.S. GSE and government
agency MBS, and U.S. Treasuries associated with repositioning the investment
securities portfolio,

•the impact of movements in foreign exchange on certain revenues, primarily as
result of the U.S. dollar strengthening,

•net losses related to cash deployment transactions, which were more than
offset by the related net interest income earned on those transactions,

•net losses, including hedging costs on an equity method investment related to
the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives, and

•net losses on certain legacy private equity investments compared with net
gains in prior year.

partially offset by

•a gain on the sale of Visa B shares. In connection with the sale, the Firm
entered into a derivative instrument with the purchaser of the shares under
which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the rate at which
the shares are convertible into Visa Class A common shares ("Visa A shares").
Refer to Note 2 for additional information,

•higher net gains related to certain Other Corporate investments, and

•proceeds from an insurance settlement in the first quarter of 2022.

Noninterest expense was $1.0 billion, down $768 million, predominantly driven
by:

•lower structural expense reflecting the impact of movements in foreign
exchange on certain expenses primarily as a result of the U.S. dollar
strengthening, and lower retained technology expense, and

•a lower contribution to the Firm's Foundation.

partially offset by

•higher investments, including the costs associated with the Firm's
international consumer growth initiatives.

The net impact of movements in foreign exchange rates associated with the
foreign exchange risk that is transferred to Treasury and CIO on certain
revenues and expenses was not material to net income. Refer to Foreign
Exchange Risk on page 62 for additional information.

Management's discussion and analysis

Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for additional information on the investment
securities portfolio and the allowance for credit losses.

The current period income tax benefit was driven by benefits related to tax
audit settlements as well as other tax adjustments, partially offset by a
change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal and
state and local taxes that also impacted the Firm's tax reserves.

Other Corporate also reflects the Firm's international consumer growth
initiatives, which include Chase U.K., the Firm's digital retail bank in the
U.K.; Nutmeg, a digital wealth manager in the U.K.; and a 40% ownership stake
in C6 Bank, a digital bank in Brazil, which closed in the first quarter of
2022.

  

Treasury and CIO overview

Treasury and CIO is predominantly responsible for measuring, monitoring,
reporting and managing the Firm's liquidity, funding, capital, structural
interest rate and foreign exchange risks. The risks managed by Treasury and
CIO arise from the activities undertaken by the Firm's four major reportable
business segments to serve their respective client bases, which generate both
on- and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities.

Treasury and CIO seeks to achieve the Firm's asset-liability management
objectives generally by investing in high-quality securities that are managed
for the longer-term as part of the Firm's investment securities portfolio.
Treasury and CIO also uses derivatives to meet the Firm's asset-liability
management objectives. Refer to Note 5 for further information on derivatives.
In addition, Treasury and CIO manages the Firm's cash position primarily
through deposits at central banks and investments in short-term instruments.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 for further information on
liquidity and funding risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 131-138
for information on interest rate and foreign exchange risks.

The investment securities portfolio predominantly consists of U.S. and
non-U.S. government securities, U.S. GSE and government agency and nonagency
mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, obligations of
U.S. states and municipalities and other ABS. At December 31, 2022, the
Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of the allowance for
credit losses, was $629.3 billion, and the average credit rating of the
securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where
available and, where not available, based primarily upon internal risk
ratings). Refer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm's investment
securities portfolio and internal risk ratings.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT  
  
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase's business activities. When the
Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on
their investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other
products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firm's
overall objective is to manage its business, and the associated risks, in a
manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and
investors, and protecting the safety and soundness of the Firm.

The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, among other things:

•Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation of
risks by all individuals within the Firm;

•Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and management within each
of the LOBs and Corporate; and

•A Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure.

The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework with strong
internal governance and independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the
"Board"). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully considered in the
Firm's performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes.

Risk governance framework

The Firm's risk governance framework involves understanding drivers of risks,
types of risks, and impacts of risks.
![jpm-20221231_g2.jpg](jpm-20221231_g2.jpg)

Drivers of risks are factors that cause a risk to exist. Drivers of risks
include, but are not limited to, the economic environment, regulatory or
government policy, competitor or market evolution, business decisions, process
or judgment error, deliberate wrongdoing, dysfunctional markets, and natural
disasters.

Types of risks are categories by which risks manifest themselves. The Firm's
risks are generally categorized in the following four risk types:

•Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or reputation
associated with poorly designed or failed business plans or inadequate
responses to changes in the operating environment.

•Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change
in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal
or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including

consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk.

•Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market
factors, such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity
prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and
liabilities held for both the short and long term.

•Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate
or failed internal processes or systems; human factors; or external events
impacting the Firm's processes or systems. Operational risk includes
compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk.

Impacts of risks are consequences of risks, both quantitative and qualitative.
There may be many consequences of risks manifesting, including quantitative
impacts such as a reduction in earnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and
fines or penalties, or qualitative impacts such as damage to the Firm's
reputation, loss of clients and customers, and regulatory and enforcement
actions.

The Firm's risk governance framework is managed on a Firmwide basis. The Firm
has an Independent Risk Management ("IRM") function, which is comprised of
Risk Management and Compliance. The Firm's Chief Executive Officer ("CEO")
appoints, subject to approval by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors
(the "Board Risk Committee"), the Firm's Chief Risk Officer ("CRO") to lead
the IRM function and maintain the risk governance framework of the Firm. The
framework is subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee through its
review and approval of the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy.

The Firm's CRO oversees and delegates authority to the Firmwide Risk
Executives ("FREs"), the Chief Risk Officers of the LOBs and Corporate ("LOB
CROs"), and the Firm's Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO"), who, in turn,
establish Risk Management and Compliance organizations, develop the Firm's
risk governance policies and standards, and define and oversee the
implementation of the Firm's risk governance framework. The LOB CROs oversee
risks that arise in their LOBs and Corporate, while FREs oversee risks that
span across the LOBs and Corporate, functions and regions. Each area of the
Firm giving rise to risk is expected to operate within the parameters
identified by the IRM function, and within its own management-identified risk
and control standards.

Three lines of defense

The Firm's "three lines of defense" are as follows:

The first line of defense consists of each LOB, Treasury and CIO, and certain
Other Corporate initiatives, including their aligned Operations, Technology
and Control Management. The first line of defense own the identification of
risks within their respective organizations and the design and execution of
controls to manage those risks.

Management's discussion and analysis

Responsibilities also include adherence to applicable laws, rules and
regulations and implementation of the risk governance framework established by
IRM, which may include policies, standards, limits, thresholds and controls.

The second line of defense is the IRM function, which is separate from, and
independently assesses and challenges, the first line of defense risk
management practices. IRM is also responsible for the identification of risks
within its respective organization, adherence to applicable laws, rules and
regulations and for the development and implementation of policies and
standards with respect to its own processes.

The third line of defense is Internal Audit, an independent function that
provides objective assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of Firmwide
processes, controls, governance and risk management. The Internal Audit
function is headed by the General Auditor, who reports to the Audit Committee
and administratively to the CEO.

In addition, there are other functions that contribute to the Firmwide control
environment but are not considered part of a particular line of defense,
including Finance, Human Resources and Legal. These other functions are
responsible for the identification of risks within their respective
organizations, adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations and
implementation of the risk governance framework established by IRM.

Risk identification and ownership

The LOBs and Corporate own the identification of risks within their respective
organizations, as well as the design and execution of controls, including IRM-
specified controls, to manage those risks. To support this activity, the Firm
has a risk identification framework designed to facilitate each LOB and
Corporate's responsibility to identify material risks inherent to the Firm's
business and operational activities, catalog them in a central repository and
review material risks on a regular basis. The IRM function reviews and
challenges the LOB and Corporate's identified risks, maintains the central
repository and provides the consolidated Firmwide results to the Firmwide Risk
Committee ("FRC") and the Board Risk Committee.

Risk appetite

The Firm's overall appetite for risk is governed by "Risk Appetite" frameworks
for quantitative and qualitative risks. Periodically the Firm's risk appetite
is set and approved by senior management (including the CEO and CRO) and
approved by the Board Risk Committee. Quantitative and qualitative risks are
assessed to monitor and measure the Firm's capacity to take risk consistent
with its stated risk appetite. Risk appetite results are reported to the Board
Risk Committee.

Risk governance and oversight structure

The independent status of the IRM function is supported by a risk governance
and oversight structure that provides channels for the escalation of risks and
issues to senior management, the FRC, and the Board of Directors, as
appropriate.

The chart below illustrates the committees of the Board of Directors and key
senior management-level committees in the Firm's risk governance and oversight
structure. In addition, there are other committees, forums and channels of
escalation that support the oversight of risk that are not shown in the chart
below or described in this Form
10-K.![jpm-20221231_g3.jpg](jpm-20221231_g3.jpg)

The Firm's Operating Committee, which consists of the Firm's CEO, CRO, Chief
Financial Officer ("CFO"), General Counsel, CEOs of the LOBs and other senior
executives, is accountable to and may refer matters to the Firm's Board of
Directors. The Operating Committee is responsible for escalating to the Board
the information necessary to facilitate the Board's exercise of its duties.

Board oversight

The Firm's Board of Directors actively oversees the business and affairs of
the Firm. This includes monitoring the Firm's financial performance and
condition and reviewing the strategic objectives and plans of the Firm. The
Board carries out a significant portion of its oversight responsibilities
through its principal standing committees, each of which consists solely of
independent members of the Board. The Board Risk Committee is the principal
committee that oversees risk matters. The Audit Committee oversees the control
environment, and the Compensation & Management Development Committee oversees
compensation and other management-related matters. Each committee of the Board
oversees reputational risks, conduct risks, and ESG matters within its scope
of responsibility.

The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board of Directors is responsible for the
oversight of management of the bank, which it discharges both acting directly
and through the principal standing committees of the Firm's Board of
Directors. Risk and control oversight on behalf of JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. is
primarily the responsibility of the Board

Risk Committee and the Audit Committee, respectively, and, with respect to
compensation and other management-related matters, the Compensation &
Management Development Committee.

The Board Risk Committee assists the Board in its oversight of management's
responsibility to implement a global risk management framework reasonably
designed to identify, assess and manage the Firm's risks. The Board Risk
Committee's responsibilities include approval of applicable primary risk
policies and review of certain associated frameworks, analysis and reporting
established by management. Breaches in risk appetite and parameters, issues
that may have a material adverse impact on the Firm, including capital and
liquidity issues, and other significant risk-related matters are escalated to
the Board Risk Committee, as appropriate.

The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of management's
responsibility to ensure that there is an effective system of controls
reasonably designed to safeguard the Firm's assets and income, ensure the
integrity of the Firm's financial statements, and maintain compliance with the
Firm's ethical standards, policies, plans and procedures, and with laws and
regulations. It also assists the Board in its oversight of the qualifications,
independence and performance of the Firm's independent registered public
accounting firm, and of the performance of the Firm's Internal Audit function.

Management's discussion and analysis

The Compensation & Management Development Committee ("CMDC") assists the Board
in its oversight of the Firm's compensation principles and practices. The CMDC
reviews and approves the Firm's compensation and qualified benefits programs.
The Committee reviews the performance of Operating Committee members against
their goals, and approves their compensation awards. In addition, the CEO's
award is subject to ratification by the independent directors of the Board.
The CMDC also reviews the development of and succession for key executives. As
part of the Board's role of reinforcing, demonstrating and communicating the
"tone at the top," the CMDC oversees the Firm's culture, including reviewing
updates from management regarding significant conduct issues and any related
actions with respect to employees, including compensation actions.

The Public Responsibility Committee oversees and reviews the Firm's positions
and practices on public responsibility matters such as community investment,
fair lending, sustainability, consumer practices and other public policy
issues that reflect the Firm's values and character and could impact the
Firm's reputation among its stakeholders. The Committee also provides guidance
on these matters to management and the Board, as appropriate.

The Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee exercises general oversight
with respect to the governance of the Board of Directors. It reviews the
qualifications of and recommends to the Board proposed nominees for election
to the Board. The Committee evaluates and recommends to the Board corporate
governance practices applicable to the Firm. It also reviews the framework for
assessing the Board's performance and self-evaluation.

Management oversight

The Firm's senior management-level committees that are primarily responsible
for key risk-related functions include:

The Firmwide Risk Committee ("FRC") is the Firm's highest management-level
risk committee. It oversees the risks inherent in the Firm's business and
provides a forum for discussion of topics, and issues that are raised or
escalated by its members and other committees.

The Firmwide Control Committee ("FCC") is an escalation committee for senior
management to review and discuss the Firmwide operational risk environment
including identified issues, operational risk metrics and significant events
that have been escalated.

Line of Business and Regional Risk Committees are responsible for overseeing
the governance, limits, and controls that have been established within the
scope of their respective activities. These committees review the ways in
which the particular LOB or the businesses operating in a particular region
could be exposed to adverse outcomes, with a focus on identifying, accepting,
escalating and/or requiring remediation of matters brought to these
committees.

  

Line of Business and Corporate Function Control Committees oversee the
operational risk and control environment of their respective business or
function, inclusive of Operational Risk, Compliance and Conduct Risks. As part
of that mandate, they are responsible for reviewing indicators of elevated or
emerging risks and other data that may impact the level of operational risk in
a business or function, addressing key operational risk issues, with an
emphasis on processes with control concerns and overseeing control
remediation.

The Asset and Liability Committee ("ALCO") is responsible for overseeing the
Firm's asset and liability management ("ALM"), including the activities and
frameworks supporting management of the balance sheet, liquidity risk,
interest rate risk, and capital risk.

The Firmwide Valuation Governance Forum ("VGF") is composed of senior finance
and risk executives and is responsible for overseeing the management of risks
arising from valuation activities conducted across the Firm.

Risk governance and oversight functions

The Firm manages its risk through risk governance and oversight functions. The
scope of a particular function or business activity may include one or more
drivers, types and/or impacts of risk. For example, Country Risk Management
oversees country risk which may be a driver of risk or an aggregation of
exposures that could give rise to multiple risk types such as credit or market
risk.

The following sections discuss the risk governance and oversight functions
that have been established to manage the risks inherent in the Firm's business
activities.

STRATEGIC RISK MANAGEMENT  
  
Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or reputation
associated with poorly designed or failed business plans or inadequate
responses to changes in the operating environment.

Management and oversight

The Operating Committee, together with the senior leadership of each LOB and
Corporate, is responsible for managing the Firm's most significant strategic
risks. IRM engages regularly in strategic business discussions and decision-
making, including participation in relevant business reviews and senior
management meetings, risk and control committees and other relevant governance
forums, and acquisition and new business initiative reviews. The Board of
Directors oversees management's strategic decisions, and the Board Risk
Committee oversees IRM and the Firm's risk governance framework.

In the process of developing business plans and strategic initiatives, LOB and
Corporate senior management identify the associated risks that are
incorporated into the Firmwide Risk Identification framework and their impact
on risk appetite.

In addition, IRM conducts a qualitative assessment of the LOB and Corporate
strategic initiatives to assess their impact on the risk profile of the Firm.

The Firm's strategic planning process, which includes the development of the
Firm's strategic plan and other strategic initiatives, is one component of
managing the Firm's strategic risk. The strategic plan outlines the Firm's
strategic framework and initiatives, and includes components such as budget,
risk appetite, capital, earnings and asset-liability management objectives.
Guided by the Firm's How We Do Business Principles, the Operating Committee
and senior management teams in each LOB and Corporate review and update the
strategic plan periodically, including evaluating the strategic framework and
performance against prior-year initiatives, assessing the operating
environment, refining existing strategies and developing new strategies.

The Firm's strategic plan, together with IRM's assessment, are provided to the
Board as part of its review and approval of the Firm's strategic plan, and the
plan is also reflected in the Firm's budget.

The Firm's balance sheet strategy, which focuses on risk-adjusted returns,
strong capital and robust liquidity, is also a component in the management of
strategic risk. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for further
information on capital risk. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages
97-104 for further information on liquidity risk. Refer to Reputation Risk
Management on page 105 for further information on reputation risk.

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT  
  
Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or composition of
capital to support the Firm's business activities and associated risks during
normal economic environments and under stressed conditions.

A strong capital position is essential to the Firm's business strategy and
competitive position. Maintaining a strong balance sheet to manage through
economic volatility is considered a strategic imperative of the Firm's Board
of Directors, CEO and Operating Committee. The Firm's fortress balance sheet
philosophy focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong capital and robust
liquidity. The Firm's capital risk management strategy focuses on maintaining
long-term stability to enable the Firm to build and invest in market-leading
businesses, including in highly stressed environments. Senior management
considers the implications on the Firm's capital prior to making significant
decisions that could impact future business activities. In addition to
considering the Firm's earnings outlook, senior management evaluates all
sources and uses of capital with a view to ensuring the Firm's capital
strength.

Capital risk management

The Firm has a Capital Risk Management function whose primary objective is to
provide independent oversight of capital risk across the Firm.

Capital Risk Management's responsibilities include:

•Defining, monitoring and reporting capital risk metrics;

•Establishing, calibrating and monitoring capital risk limits and indicators,
including capital risk appetite;

•Developing a process to classify, monitor and report capital limit breaches;

•Performing an assessment of the Firm's capital management activities,
including changes made to the Contingency Capital Plan described below; and

•Conducting assessments of the Firm's regulatory capital framework intended to
ensure compliance with applicable regulatory capital rules.

Capital management

Treasury and CIO is responsible for capital management.

The primary objectives of the Firm's capital management are to:

•Maintain sufficient capital in order to continue to build and invest in the
Firm's businesses through the cycle and in stressed environments;

•Retain flexibility to take advantage of future investment opportunities;

•Promote the Firm's ability to serve as a source of strength to its
subsidiaries;

•Ensure the Firm operates above the minimum regulatory capital ratios as well
as maintain "well-capitalized" status for the Firm and its insured depository
institution ("IDI") subsidiaries at all times under applicable regulatory
capital requirements;

•Meet capital distribution objectives; and

•Maintain sufficient capital resources to operate throughout a resolution
period in accordance with the Firm's preferred resolution strategy.

The Firm addresses these objectives through:

•Establishing internal minimum capital requirements and maintaining a strong
capital governance framework. The internal minimum capital levels consider the
Firm's regulatory capital requirements as well as an internal assessment of
capital adequacy, in normal economic cycles and in stress events;

•Retaining flexibility in order to react to a range of potential events; and

•Regular monitoring of the Firm's capital position and following prescribed
escalation protocols, both at the Firm and material legal entity levels.

Governance

Committees responsible for overseeing the Firm's capital management include
the Capital Governance Committee, the Firmwide ALCO and LOB and regional
ALCOs, and the CIO, Treasury and Corporate ("CTC") Risk Committee. In
addition, the Board Risk Committee periodically reviews the Firm's capital
risk tolerance. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on pages 81-84 for
additional discussion of the Firmwide ALCO and other risk-related committees.

Capital planning and stress testing

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review

The Federal Reserve requires large Bank Holding Companies ("BHCs"), including
the Firm, to submit at least annually a capital plan that has been reviewed
and approved by the Board of Directors. The Federal Reserve uses Comprehensive
Capital Analysis and Review ("CCAR") and other stress testing processes to
ensure that large BHCs have sufficient capital during periods of economic and
financial stress, and have robust, forward-looking capital assessment and
planning processes in place that address each BHC's unique risks to enable it
to absorb losses under certain stress scenarios. Through CCAR, the Federal
Reserve evaluates each BHC's capital adequacy and internal capital adequacy
assessment processes ("ICAAP"), as well as its plans to make capital
distributions, such as dividend payments or stock repurchases. The Federal
Reserve uses results under the severely adverse scenario from its supervisory
stress test to determine each firm's Stress Capital Buffer ("SCB") requirement
for the coming year.

On June 27, 2022, the Firm announced that it had completed the Federal
Reserve's 2022 CCAR stress test process. On August 4, 2022, the Federal
Reserve affirmed the Firm's 2022 SCB requirement of 4.0% (up from 3.2%), and
the Firm's Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement, including regulatory
buffers, of 12.0% (up from 11.2%). The 2022 SCB requirement became effective
on October 1, 2022, and will remain in effect until September 30, 2023.

Refer to Capital actions on page 94 for information on actions taken by the
Firm's Board of Directors.

Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process

Annually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs the Board of Directors of
the ongoing assessment of the Firm's processes for managing the sources and
uses of capital as well as compliance with supervisory expectations for
capital planning and capital adequacy. The Firm's ICAAP integrates stress
testing protocols with capital planning. The Firm's Audit Committee is
responsible for reviewing and approving the capital planning framework.

Stress testing assesses the potential impact of alternative economic and
business scenarios on the Firm's earnings and capital. Economic scenarios, and
the parameters underlying those scenarios, are defined centrally and applied
uniformly across the businesses. These scenarios are articulated in terms of
macroeconomic factors, which are key drivers of business results; global
market shocks, which generate short-term but severe trading losses; and
idiosyncratic operational risk events. The scenarios are intended to capture
and stress key vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. In
addition to CCAR and other periodic stress testing, management also considers
tailored stress scenarios and sensitivity analyses, as necessary.

Contingency Capital Plan

The Firm's Contingency Capital Plan establishes the capital management
framework for the Firm and specifies the principles underlying the Firm's
approach towards capital management in normal economic conditions and in
stressed environments. The Contingency Capital Plan defines how the Firm
calibrates its targeted capital levels and meets minimum capital requirements,
monitors the ongoing appropriateness of planned capital distributions, and
sets out the capital contingency actions that are expected to be taken or
considered at various levels of capital depletion during a period of stress.

Regulatory capital

The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-
capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The OCC
establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm's
IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The U.S. capital
requirements generally follow the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee, as
amended from time to time.

  

Basel III Overview

The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall
capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. BHCs and
banks, including the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs
and banks is determined by calculating RWA, which are on-balance sheet assets
and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive
approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach ("Basel
III Standardized"), and an advanced approach ("Basel III Advanced"). For each
of the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is
evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches
compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Firm's
Basel III Standardized risk-based ratios are currently more binding than the
Basel III Advanced risk-based ratios.

Basel III establishes capital requirements for calculating credit risk RWA and
market risk RWA, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, operational risk RWA.
Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized
and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is
based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal
credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk
RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by
counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a
generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III
Advanced. In addition to the RWA calculated under these approaches, the Firm
may supplement such amounts to incorporate management judgment and feedback
from its regulators.

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approaches banking
organizations, including the Firm, to calculate the SLR. Refer to SLR on page
93 for additional information.

Key Regulatory Developments

CECL regulatory capital transition.

Until December 31, 2021, the Firm's capital reflected a two year delay of the
effects of CECL provided by the Federal Reserve Board in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Beginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL capital benefit is being
phased out at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of December 31, 2022,
the Firm's CET1 capital reflected the remaining $2.2 billion benefit
associated with the CECL capital transition provisions.

Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm phased out 25% of the other
CECL capital transition provisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted
average assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as applicable.

Refer to Note 1 for further information on the CECL accounting guidance.

Management's discussion and analysis

Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk. On January 1, 2022, the
Firm adopted "Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk" ("SA-CCR"),
which replaced the Current Exposure Method used to measure derivatives
counterparty exposure under the Standardized and Advanced approach RWA where
internal models are not used, as well as leverage exposure used to calculate
the SLR in the regulatory capital framework. The rule issued by the U.S.
banking regulators in November 2019 applies to Basel III Advanced Approaches
banking organizations, such as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

The adoption of SA-CCR on January 1, 2022 increased the Firm's Standardized
RWA by approximately $40 billion based on the Firm's derivatives exposure as
of December 31, 2021, which resulted in a decrease of approximately 30 bps to
the Firm's CET1 capital ratio and a modest decrease in its total leverage
exposure. In addition, the adoption of SA-CCR increased the Firm's Advanced
RWA, but to a lesser extent than Standardized RWA.

Risk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements

The following chart presents the Firm's Basel III CET1 capital ratio
requirements under the Basel III rules currently in effect.

![jpm-20221231_g4.jpg](jpm-20221231_g4.jpg)

All banking institutions are currently required to have a minimum CET1 capital
ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets.

Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, are required to hold
additional levels of capital to serve as a "capital conservation buffer". The
capital conservation buffer incorporates a GSIB surcharge, a discretionary
countercyclical capital buffer and a fixed capital conservation buffer of 2.5%
for Advanced regulatory capital requirements and a variable SCB requirement,
floored at 2.5%, for Standardized regulatory capital requirements.

Under the Federal Reserve's GSIB rule, the Firm is required to assess its GSIB
surcharge on an annual basis under two separately prescribed methods based on
data for the previous fiscal year-end, and is subject to the higher of the
two. "Method 1" reflects the GSIB surcharge as prescribed by the Basel
Committee's assessment methodology, and is calculated by the Financial
Stability Board ("FSB") across five criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional
activity, interconnectedness, complexity and substitutability. "Method 2",
calculated by the Firm, modifies the Method 1 requirements to include a
measure of short-term wholesale funding in place of substitutability, and
introduces a GSIB score "multiplication factor".

Management's discussion and analysis

The following table presents the Firm's effective GSIB surcharge for the years
ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. For 2023, the Firm's effective GSIB
surcharge under Method 1 and Method 2 has increased to 2.5% and 4.0%,
respectively.

| | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| 2023| 2022| 2021  
Method 1| 2.5 | %| 2.0 | %| 2.0 | %  
Method 2| 4.0 | %| 3.5 | %| 3.5 | %  
  
On November 21, 2022, the FSB released its annual GSIB list based upon data as
of December 31, 2021, which affirmed the Firm's Method 1 GSIB surcharge of
2.5% (up from 2.0%), effective January 1, 2023.

The Firm's Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of December 31, 2021 is
4.5%, which will be effective January 1, 2024. The Firm's estimated Method 2
surcharge calculated using data as of December 31, 2022 is 4.5%. Accordingly,
based on the GSIB rule currently in effect, the Firm's effective GSIB
surcharge is expected to increase to 4.5% on January 1, 2024.

The U.S. federal regulatory capital standards include a framework for setting
a discretionary countercyclical capital buffer taking into account the macro
financial environment in which large, internationally active banks function.
As of December 31, 2022, the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer remained at
0%. The Federal Reserve will continue to review the buffer at least annually.
The buffer can be increased if the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC determine
that systemic risks are meaningfully above normal and can be calibrated up to
an additional 2.5% of RWA subject to a 12-month implementation period.

Failure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in excess of the risk-based
regulatory capital minimum plus the capital conservation buffer (inclusive of
the GSIB surcharge) and any countercyclical buffer will result in limitations
to the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute, such as through
dividends and common share repurchases, as well as certain executive
discretionary bonus payments.

Risk-based Capital Targets

The Firm's current target for its Basel III Standardized CET1 capital ratio is
13.0% for the first quarter of 2023, increasing to 13.5% for the first quarter
of 2024 with consideration for an increase in the GSIB surcharge in 2024, and
assuming no change in the Stress Capital Buffer. The Firm's quarterly capital
ratios may vary from these targets dependent on market conditions. These
targets are based on the Basel III capital rules currently in effect.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity

The Federal Reserve's TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB top-tier holding
companies, including the Firm, to maintain minimum levels of external TLAC and
eligible long-term debt ("eligible LTD"). Refer to TLAC on page 95 for
additional information.

  

Leverage-based Capital Regulatory Requirements

Supplementary leverage ratio

Banking organizations subject to the Basel III Advanced approach are currently
required to have a minimum SLR of 3.0%. Certain banking organizations,
including the Firm, are also required to hold an additional 2.0% leverage
buffer.

The SLR is defined as Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided by the Firm's
total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure is calculated by taking the
Firm's total average on-balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to be
deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding certain off-balance sheet exposures,
such as undrawn commitments and derivatives potential future exposure.

Failure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater than the regulatory requirement
will result in limitations on the amount of capital that the Firm may
distribute such as through dividends and common share repurchases, as well as
on certain executive discretionary bonus payments.

Other regulatory capital

In addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of Basel III, the Firm
and its IDI subsidiaries must also maintain minimum capital and leverage
ratios in order to be "well-capitalized" under the regulations issued by the
Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action ("PCA") requirements of the
FDIC Improvement Act ("FDICIA"), respectively. Refer to Note 27 for additional
information.

Additional information regarding the Firm's capital ratios, as well as the
U.S. federal regulatory capital standards to which the Firm is subject, is
presented in Note 27. Refer to the Firm's Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital
Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm's website, for further
information on the Firm's Basel III measures.

reports for additional information.

Line of business equity

Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration a
variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and
applicable regulatory capital requirements. ROE is measured and internal
targets for expected returns are established as key measures of a business
segment's performance.

The Firm's allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA,
Basel III Advanced RWA, the GSIB surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a
severe stress environment. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and
methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the
capital allocated to the LOBs may change. As of January 1, 2023, the Firm has
changed its line of business capital allocations primarily as a result of
updates to the Firm's capital requirements and changes in RWA for each LOB.

The following table presents the capital allocated to each business segment.

Management's discussion and analysis

Capital actions

Common stock dividends

The Firm's common stock dividends are planned as part of the Capital
Management governance framework in line with the Firm's capital management
objectives.

The Firm's quarterly common stock dividend is currently $1.00 per share. The
Firm's dividends are subject to approval by the Board of Directors on a
quarterly basis.

Refer to Note 21 and Note 26 for information regarding dividend restrictions.

The following table shows the common dividend payout ratio based on net income
applicable to common equity.

Common dividend payout ratio| 33 | %| | 25 | %| | 40 | %  
  
Common stock

Effective May 1, 2022, the Firm is authorized to purchase up to $30 billion of
common shares under its common share repurchase program, which superseded the
previously approved repurchase program under which the Firm was authorized to
purchase up to $30 billion of common shares.

On July 14, 2022, the Firm announced that it had temporarily suspended share
repurchases in anticipation of the increase in the Firm's regulatory capital
requirements. The Firm had set a target for achieving CET1 capital of 13.0% by
the first quarter of 2023. The Firm met and exceeded that target in the fourth
quarter of 2022, and resumed repurchasing shares under its common share
repurchase program in the first quarter of 2023.

The following table sets forth the Firm's repurchases of common stock for the
years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

| | $| 3,122 | | | $| 18,448 | | | $| 6,397 |  
  
(a)As directed by the Federal Reserve, total net repurchases and common stock
dividends in the first and second quarter of 2021 were restricted and could
not exceed the average of the Firm's net income for the four preceding
calendar quarters. Effective July 1, 2021, the Firm became subject to the
normal capital distribution restrictions provided under the regulatory capital
framework.

(b)On March 15, 2020, in response to the economic disruptions caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended repurchases of its common
stock. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large banks, including
the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases through the end of 2020.

  

The Board of Directors' authorization to repurchase common shares is utilized
at management's discretion, and the timing of purchases and the exact amount
of common shares that may be repurchased is subject to various factors,
including market conditions; legal and regulatory considerations affecting the
amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm's capital position (taking
into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and
alternative investment opportunities. The $30 billion common share repurchase
program approved by the Board does not establish specific price targets or
timetables. The repurchase program may be suspended by management at any time;
and may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated
transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans, which are written trading plans
that the Firm may enter into from time to time under Rule 10b5-1 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and which allow the Firm to repurchase its
common shares during periods when it may otherwise not be repurchasing common
shares -- for example, during internal trading blackout periods.

Refer to Part II, Item 5: Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related
Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities on page 34 of
the 2022 Form 10-K for additional information regarding repurchases of the
Firm's equity securities.

Other capital requirements

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity

The Federal Reserve's TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB top-tier holding
companies, including the Firm, to maintain minimum levels of external TLAC and
eligible long-term debt.

The external TLAC requirements and the minimum level of eligible long-term
debt requirements are shown below:

![jpm-20221231_g5.jpg](jpm-20221231_g5.jpg)

(a)RWA is the greater of Standardized and Advanced compared to their
respective regulatory capital ratio requirements.

Failure to maintain TLAC equal to or in excess of the regulatory minimum plus
applicable buffers will result in limitations on the amount of capital that
the Firm may distribute, such as through dividends and common share
repurchases, as well as on certain executive discretionary bonus payments.

The following table presents the eligible external TLAC and eligible LTD
amounts, as well as a representation of these amounts as a percentage of the
Firm's total RWA and total leverage exposure applying the impact of the CECL
capital transition provisions as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

As of January 1, 2023, the regulatory requirement for TLAC to RWA and LTD to
RWA ratios has increased by 50 bps to 23.0% and 10.0%, respectively, due to
the increase in the Firm's GSIB requirements. Refer to Risk-based Capital
Regulatory Requirements on pages 89-90 for further information on the GSIB
surcharge.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  
  
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet its
contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise or that it does
not have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor of funding and
liquidity to support its assets and liabilities.

Liquidity risk management

The Firm has a Liquidity Risk Management ("LRM") function whose primary
objective is to provide independent oversight of liquidity risk across the
Firm. Liquidity Risk Management's responsibilities include:

•Defining, monitoring and reporting liquidity risk metrics;

•Independently establishing and monitoring limits and indicators, including
liquidity risk appetite;

•Developing a process to classify, monitor and report limit breaches;

•Performing an independent review of liquidity risk management processes to
evaluate their adequacy and effectiveness based on LRM's Independent Review
Framework;

•Monitoring and reporting internal Firmwide and legal entity liquidity stress
tests, regulatory defined metrics, as well as liquidity positions, balance
sheet variances and funding activities; and

•Approving or escalating for review new or updated liquidity stress
assumptions.

Liquidity management

Treasury and CIO is responsible for liquidity management.

The primary objectives of the Firm's liquidity management are to:

•Ensure that the Firm's core businesses and material legal entities are able
to operate in support of client needs and meet contractual and contingent
financial obligations through normal economic cycles as well as during stress
events, and

•Manage an optimal funding mix and availability of liquidity sources.

The Firm addresses these objectives through:

•Analyzing and understanding the liquidity characteristics of the assets and
liabilities of the Firm, LOBs and legal entities, taking into account legal,
regulatory, and operational restrictions;

•Developing internal liquidity stress testing assumptions;

•Defining and monitoring Firmwide and legal entity-specific liquidity
strategies, policies, reporting and contingency funding plans;

•Managing liquidity within the Firm's approved liquidity risk appetite
tolerances and limits;

•Managing compliance with regulatory requirements related to funding and
liquidity risk; and

•Setting FTP in accordance with underlying liquidity characteristics of
balance sheet assets and liabilities as well as certain off-balance sheet
items.

As part of the Firm's overall liquidity management strategy, the Firm manages
liquidity and funding using a centralized, global approach designed to:

•Optimize liquidity sources and uses;

•Monitor exposures;

•Identify constraints on the transfer of liquidity between the Firm's legal
entities; and

•Maintain the appropriate amount of surplus liquidity at a Firmwide and legal
entity level, where relevant.

Governance

Committees responsible for liquidity governance include the Firmwide ALCO as
well as LOB and regional ALCOs, the Treasurer Committee, and the CTC Risk
Committee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee reviews and recommends to the
Board of Directors, for formal approval, the Firm's liquidity risk tolerances,
liquidity strategy, and liquidity policy. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on
pages 81-84 for further discussion of ALCO and other risk-related committees.

Internal stress testing

Liquidity stress tests are intended to ensure that the Firm has sufficient
liquidity under a variety of adverse scenarios, including scenarios analyzed
as part of the Firm's resolution and recovery planning. Stress scenarios are
produced for JPMorgan Chase & Co. ("Parent Company") and the Firm's material
legal entities on a regular basis, and other stress tests are performed in
response to specific market events or concerns. Liquidity stress tests assume
all of the Firm's contractual financial obligations are met and take into
consideration:

•Varying levels of access to unsecured and secured funding markets;

•Estimated non-contractual and contingent cash outflows;

•Considerations of credit rating downgrades;

•Collateral haircuts; and

•Potential impediments to the availability and transferability of liquidity
between jurisdictions and material legal entities such as regulatory, legal or
other restrictions.

Liquidity outflows are modeled across a range of time horizons and currency
dimensions and contemplate both market and idiosyncratic stresses.

Results of stress tests are considered in the formulation of the Firm's
funding plan and assessment of its liquidity position. The Parent Company acts
as a source of funding for the Firm through equity and long-term debt
issuances, and its intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC
(the "IHC"), provides funding support to the ongoing operations of the Parent
Company and its subsidiaries. The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent
Company, the IHC, and operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply
with liquidity risk tolerances and

Management's discussion and analysis

minimum liquidity requirements, and to manage through periods of stress when
access to normal funding sources may be disrupted.

Contingency funding plan

The Firm's Contingency Funding Plan ("CFP") sets out the strategies for
addressing and managing liquidity resource needs during a liquidity stress
event and incorporates liquidity risk limits, indicators and risk appetite
tolerances. The CFP also identifies the alternative contingent funding and
liquidity resources available to the Firm and its legal entities in a period
of stress.

LCR and HQLA

The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an
amount of eligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet their respective estimated
total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of
significant stress. Eligible HQLA, for purposes of calculating the LCR, is the
amount of unencumbered HQLA that satisfy certain operational considerations as
defined in the LCR rule. HQLA primarily consist of cash and certain high-
quality liquid securities as defined in the LCR rule.

Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and
that is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from the
Firm's reported eligible HQLA.

Estimated net cash outflows are based on standardized stress outflow and
inflow rates prescribed in the LCR rule, which are applied to the balances of
the Firm's assets, sources of funds, and obligations. The LCR for both the
Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum of 100%.

The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s
average LCR for the three months ended December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022
and December 31, 2021 based on the Firm's interpretation of the LCR framework.

(a)Represents cash on deposit at central banks, primarily the Federal Reserve

(b)Predominantly U.S. Treasuries, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, and
sovereign bonds net of applicable haircuts under the LCR rule.

(c)Eligible HQLA securities may be reported in securities borrowed or
purchased under resale agreements, trading assets, or investment securities on
the Firm's Consolidated balance sheets.

(d)Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are
not transferable to non-bank affiliates.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR decreased during the three months
ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended September 30,
2022 reflecting a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s HQLA, primarily due
to a reduction in cash associated with a decline in deposits, and loan growth.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR for the three months ended December
31, 2022 decreased when compared with the same period in the prior year,
reflecting a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s HQLA as a result of a
reduction in cash from loan growth and a decline in deposits as well as lower
market values of HQLA-eligible investment securities. Refer to Note 10 for
additional information on the Firm's investment securities portfolio.

The Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR fluctuates from period to
period due to changes in its eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as
a result of ongoing business activity. Refer to the Firm's U.S. LCR Disclosure
reports, which are available on the Firm's website, for a further discussion
of the Firm's LCR.

Other liquidity sources

In addition to the assets reported in the Firm's eligible HQLA discussed
above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and
debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity.
This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these
securities was approximately $694 billion and $914 billion as of December 31,
2022 and 2021, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that could be
raised at any particular time would be dependent on prevailing market
conditions. The fair value decreased compared to December 31, 2021, primarily
due to a decrease in excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A., as noted above.

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the FHLBs and the discount
window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of collateral pledged by the
Firm to such banks of approximately $323 billion and $308 billion as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the
benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm's eligible HQLA or other
unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve
Banks discount window and other central banks. Available borrowing capacity
increased from December 31, 2021 primarily due to increased credit card
receivables pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks. Although available, the Firm
does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks discount
window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity.

NSFR

The net stable funding ratio ("NSFR") is a liquidity requirement for large
banking organizations that is intended to measure the adequacy of "available"
stable funding that is sufficient to meet their "required" amounts of stable
funding over a one-year horizon.

As of December 31, 2022, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant
with the 100% minimum NSFR requirement, based on the Firm's current
interpretation of the final rule. The Firm will be required to publicly
disclose its quarterly average NSFR semiannually beginning in the second half
of 2023.

Management's discussion and analysis

Funding

Sources of funds

Management believes that the Firm's unsecured and secured funding capacity is
sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations, which includes
both short- and long-term cash requirements.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of funding
including stable deposits, secured and unsecured funding in the capital
markets and stockholders' equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access
funding through short- or long-term secured borrowings, through the issuance
of unsecured

long-term debt, or from borrowings from the IHC. The Firm's non-bank
subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and
short-term secured borrowings which are primarily securities loaned or sold
under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by Treasury and CIO in
the Firm's investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-
term liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk
characteristics.

Refer to Note 28 for additional information on off-balance sheet obligations.

Deposits

The table below summarizes, by LOB and Corporate, the period-end and average
deposit balances as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the Firm's reliance on
the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of the Firm's deposits
are consumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both
considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are
considered to be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from
customers that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm.

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more
representative of deposit trends than period-end deposit balances. However,
during periods of market disruption those trends could be affected.

Average deposits were higher for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to
the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting:

•growth in CCB from existing and new accounts across both consumer and small
business customers, partially offset by a decline in deposits starting in the
second half of 2022, impacted by growth in customer spending, and

•net inflows in AWM resulting from the residual effects of certain government
actions, partially offset by migration into investments starting in the second
quarter of 2022 as a result of the rising interest rate environment

partially offset by

•lower average deposits in CIB and CB due to attrition, also as a result of
the rising interest rate environment.

  

Period-end deposits decreased reflecting:

•attrition in CB and CIB, particularly non-operating deposits in CB, partially
offset by net issuances of structured notes in Markets,

•net outflows into investments in AWM amid the rising interest rate
environment, and

•a decline in balances in existing accounts in CCB due to higher customer
spending, predominantly offset by net inflows into new accounts.

The increase in deposits for both spot and averages in Corporate was driven by
the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives.

Refer to the discussion of the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis and
the Business Segment Results on pages 55-56 and pages 61-80, respectively, for
further information on deposit and liability balance trends.

Certain deposits are covered by insurance protection that provides additional
funding stability and results in a benefit to the LCR. Deposit insurance
protection may be available to depositors in the countries in which the
deposits are placed. For example, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
("FDIC") provides deposit insurance protection for deposits placed in a U.S.
depository institution. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Firmwide estimated
uninsured deposits were $1,383.7 billion and $1,489.6 billion, respectively,
primarily reflecting wholesale operating deposits.

Total uninsured deposits include time deposits. The table below presents an
estimate of uninsured U.S. and non-U.S. time deposits, and their remaining
maturities. The Firm's estimates of its uninsured U.S. time deposits are based
on data that the Firm calculates periodically under applicable FDIC
regulations. For purposes of this presentation, all non-U.S. time deposits are
deemed to be uninsured.

Short-term funding

The Firm's sources of short-term secured funding primarily consist of
securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. These instruments
are secured predominantly by high-quality securities collateral, including
government-issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold
under agreements to repurchase increased at December 31, 2022, compared with
December 31, 2021, due to higher secured financing of trading assets in
Markets, partially offset by lower secured financing of AFS investment
securities in Treasury and CIO.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to
repurchase fluctuate over time due to investment and financing activities of
clients, the Firm's demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix of
the Firm's liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for
both the investment securities and market-making portfolios), and other market
and portfolio factors.

The Firm's sources of short-term unsecured funding primarily consist of
issuances of wholesale commercial paper and other borrowed funds.

The decrease in period-end commercial paper and the increase in average
balances for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the respective prior
year periods, was due to changes in net issuance levels primarily for short-
term liquidity management.

Long-term funding and issuance

Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and
liquidity for the Firm. The Firm's long-term funding plan is driven primarily
by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory
requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining
diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The
Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its
optimal long-term funding plan.

The significant majority of the Firm's long-term unsecured funding is issued
by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in support of the funding needs
of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The Parent Company advances
substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC
does not issue debt to external counterparties. The following table summarizes
long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the years ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021. Refer to Note 20 for additional information on the
IHC and long-term debt.

Management's discussion and analysis

Credit ratings

The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings.
Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the Firm's access
to liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional
collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and
counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude of the
impact of ratings downgrades depends on numerous contractual and behavioral
factors,

which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and stress
testing metrics. The Firm believes that it

maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in funding
capacity due to ratings downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm's funding requirements for VIEs and other third-party
commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to
liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in Note 5 for additional
information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on the funding
requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and collateral agreements.

  

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm's principal bank and
non-bank subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022, were as follows:

J.P. Morgan SE's predecessors, J.P. Morgan Bank Luxembourg S.A. and J.P.
Morgan AG.

  

On September 29, 2022, Moody's upgraded the Parent Company's long-term issuer
rating to A1 (previously A2) and changed the long-term outlook to stable
(previously positive). All other ratings and outlooks of the Parent Company
and those of the Firm's principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries were affirmed
by Moody's.

JPMorgan Chase's unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call
for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the
existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require
additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm's credit
ratings, financial ratios, earnings, or stock price.

  

Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and
diverse earnings stream, strong capital and liquidity ratios, strong credit
quality and risk management controls, and diverse funding sources. Rating
agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory
developments, future profitability, risk management practices, and litigation
matters, as well as their broader ratings methodologies. Changes in any of
these factors could lead to changes in the Firm's credit ratings.

REPUTATION RISK MANAGEMENT  
  
Reputation risk is the risk that an action or inaction may negatively impact
perception of the Firm's integrity and reduce confidence in the Firm's
competence by various constituents, including clients, counterparties,
customers, investors, regulators, employees, communities or the broader
public.

Organization and management

Reputation Risk Management establishes the governance framework for managing
reputation risk across the Firm's LOBs and Corporate. Reputation risk is
inherently challenging to identify, manage, and quantify.

The Firm's reputation risk management function includes the following
activities:

•Maintaining a Firmwide Reputation Risk Governance policy and a standard
consistent with the reputation risk framework

•Overseeing the governance execution through processes and infrastructure that
support consistent identification, escalation, management and monitoring of
reputation risk issues Firmwide

The types of events that result in reputation risk are wide-ranging and may be
introduced by the Firm's employees and the clients, customers and
counterparties with which the Firm does business. These events could result in
financial losses, litigation, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, penalties
or other sanctions, as well as other harm to the Firm.

Governance and oversight

The Reputation Risk Governance policy establishes the principles for managing
reputation risk for the Firm. It is the responsibility of employees in each
LOB and Corporate to consider the reputation of the Firm when deciding whether
to offer a new product, engage in a transaction or client relationship, enter
a new jurisdiction, initiate a business process or consider any other
activity. Environmental impacts and social concerns are increasingly important
considerations in assessing the Firm's reputation risk, and are a component of
the Firm's reputation risk governance.

Reputation risk issues that are deemed to be material are escalated as
appropriate.

CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT  
  
Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change
in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal
or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including consumer credit
risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk.

Credit risk management

Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit
profile of a client, counterparty or customer. The Firm provides credit to a
variety of clients and customers, ranging from large corporate and
institutional clients to individual consumers and small businesses. In its
consumer businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its
home lending, credit card, auto, and business banking businesses. In its
wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk through its
underwriting, lending, market-making, and hedging activities with and for
clients and counterparties, as well as through its operating services
activities (such as cash management and clearing activities), and securities
financing activities. The Firm is also exposed to credit risk through its
investment securities portfolio and cash placed with banks.

Credit Risk Management monitors, measures and manages credit risk throughout
the Firm and defines credit risk policies and procedures. The Firm's credit
risk management governance includes the following activities:

•Maintaining a credit risk policy framework

•Monitoring, measuring and managing credit risk across all portfolio segments,
including transaction and exposure approval

•Setting industry and geographic concentration limits, as appropriate, and
establishing underwriting guidelines

•Assigning and managing credit authorities in connection with the approval of
credit exposure

•Managing criticized exposures and delinquent loans, and

•Estimating credit losses and supporting appropriate credit risk-based capital
management

Risk identification and measurement

To measure credit risk, the Firm employs several methodologies for estimating
the likelihood of obligor or counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring
credit risk vary depending on several factors, including type of asset (e.g.,
consumer versus wholesale), risk measurement parameters (e.g., delinquency
status and borrower's credit score versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk
management and collection processes (e.g., retail collection center versus
centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk measurement is based on the
probability of default of an obligor or counterparty, the loss severity given
a default event and the exposure at default.

Based on these factors and the methodology and estimates described in Note 13
and Note 10, the Firm estimates credit losses for its exposures. The allowance
for loan losses reflects estimated credit losses related to the consumer and
wholesale held-for-investment loan portfolios, the allowance for lending-
related commitments reflects estimated credit losses related to the Firm's
lending-related commitments and the allowance for investment securities
reflects estimated credit losses related to the investment securities
portfolio. Refer to Note 13, Note 10 and Critical Accounting Estimates used by
the Firm on pages 149-152 for further information.

In addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are reflected in the
allocation of credit risk capital and represent the potential volatility of
actual losses relative to the established allowances for loan losses and
lending-related commitments. The analyses for these losses include stress
testing that considers alternative economic scenarios as described below.

Stress testing

Stress testing is important in measuring and managing credit risk in the
Firm's credit portfolio. The stress testing process assesses the potential
impact of alternative economic and business scenarios on estimated credit
losses for the Firm. Economic scenarios and the underlying parameters are
defined centrally, articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors and applied
across the businesses. The stress test results may indicate credit migration,
changes in delinquency trends and potential losses in the credit portfolio. In
addition to the periodic stress testing processes, management also considers
additional stresses outside these scenarios, including industry and country-
specific stress scenarios, as necessary. The Firm uses stress testing to
inform decisions on setting risk appetite both at a Firm and LOB level, as
well as to assess the impact of stress on individual counterparties.

Risk monitoring and management

The Firm has developed policies and practices that are designed to preserve
the independence and integrity of the approval and decision-making process for
extending credit so that credit risks are assessed accurately, approved
properly, monitored regularly and managed actively at both the transaction and
portfolio levels. The policy framework establishes credit approval
authorities, concentration limits, risk-rating methodologies, portfolio review
parameters and guidelines for management of distressed exposures. In addition,
certain models, assumptions and inputs used in evaluating and monitoring
credit risk are independently validated by groups that are separate from the
LOBs.

Consumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency and other trends, including
any concentrations at the portfolio level, as certain of these trends can be
addressed through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines.
Consumer Risk Management evaluates delinquency and other trends against
business expectations, current and forecasted economic conditions, and
industry benchmarks. Historical and forecasted economic performance and trends
are incorporated into the modeling of estimated consumer credit losses and are
part of the monitoring of the credit risk profile of the portfolio.

Wholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an aggregate portfolio,
industry, and individual client and counterparty level with established
concentration limits that are reviewed and revised periodically as deemed
appropriate by management. Industry and counterparty limits, as measured in
terms of exposure and economic risk appetite, are subject to stress-based loss
constraints. Wrong-way risk is the risk that exposure to a counterparty is
positively correlated with the impact of a default by the same counterparty,
which could cause exposure to increase at the same time as the counterparty's
capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing.

Management of the Firm's wholesale credit risk exposure is accomplished
through a number of means, including:

•Loan underwriting and credit approval processes

•Loan syndications and participations

•Loan sales and securitizations

•Credit derivatives

•Master netting agreements, and

•Collateral and other risk-reduction techniques

In addition to Credit Risk Management, an independent Credit Review function
is responsible for:

•Independently validating or changing the risk grades assigned to exposures in
the Firm's wholesale credit  portfolio, and assessing the timeliness of risk
grade changes initiated by responsible business units; and

•Evaluating the effectiveness of the credit management processes of the LOBs
and Corporate, including the adequacy of credit analyses and risk grading/loss
given default ("LGD") rationales, proper monitoring and management of credit
exposures, and compliance with applicable grading policies and underwriting
guidelines.

Refer to Note 12 for further discussion of consumer and wholesale loans.

Risk reporting

To enable monitoring of credit risk and effective decision-making, aggregate
credit exposure, credit quality forecasts, concentration levels and risk
profile changes are reported regularly to senior members of Credit Risk
Management. Detailed portfolio reporting of industry, clients, counterparties
and customers, product and geography are prepared, and the appropriateness of
the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by senior management at least on a
quarterly basis. Through the risk reporting and governance structure, credit
risk trends and limit exceptions are provided regularly to, and discussed
with, risk committees, senior management and the Board of Directors.

Customer and client assistance

The Firm provided various forms of assistance to customers and clients
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including payment deferrals and covenant
modifications. Assistance provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could
delay the recognition of delinquencies, nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs
for those customers and clients who would have otherwise moved into past due
or nonaccrual status. Refer to Notes 12 and 13 for further information on the
Firm's accounting policies for loan modifications and the allowance for credit
losses.

  

Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP")

Maturities and sensitivity to changes in interest rates

The table below sets forth loan maturities by scheduled repayments, by class
of loan and the distribution between fixed and floating interest rates based
on the stated terms of the loan agreements. Effective December 31, 2022, the
Firm revised its methodology from contractual maturities to scheduled
repayments. The Firm estimated the principal repayment amounts for both the
residential real estate and auto and other loan classes by calculating the
weighted-average loan balance and interest rates for loan pools based on
remaining loan term.

Consumer, excluding credit card

Portfolio analysis

Loans decreased from December 31, 2021 driven by residential real estate loans
at fair value and auto and other loans, largely offset by higher retained
residential real estate loans.

The following discussions provide information concerning individual loan
products. Refer to Note 12 for further information about this portfolio,
including information about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit
quality indicators.

Residential real estate: The residential real estate portfolio, including
loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, predominantly consists of prime
mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit.

Retained loans increased compared to December 31, 2021 reflecting
originations, net of paydowns. Retained nonaccrual loans decreased from
December 31, 2021 reflecting improved credit performance and loan sales. Net
recoveries were lower for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the
prior year driven by lower prepayments due to higher interest rates, partially
offset by lower gross charge-offs.

Loans at fair value decreased from December 31, 2021, as warehouse loan sales
in Home Lending outpaced originations due to higher interest rates and loan
sales in CIB outpaced loan purchase activity. Nonaccrual loans at fair value
decreased from December 31, 2021 driven by net portfolio activity in CIB.

The carrying value of home equity lines of credit outstanding was $15.7
billion at December 31, 2022. This amount included $5.1 billion of HELOCs that
have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have been
modified and $5.0 billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily
mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving
period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law
when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk
profile.

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of interest-only residential
mortgage loans were $36.3 billion and $30.0 billion, respectively. These loans
have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate
or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically
originated as higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly
in AWM. The interest-only residential mortgage loan portfolio reflected net
recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2022. The credit performance of
this portfolio is comparable with the performance of the broader prime
mortgage portfolio.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm's

residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed

by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-for-sale and loans at
fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain potential unrecoverable
claim payments related to government-insured loans and considers this exposure
in estimating the allowance for loan losses.

Geographic composition and current estimated loan-to-value ratio of
residential real estate loans

At December 31, 2022, $152.7 billion, or 64% of the total retained residential
real estate loan portfolio, excluding mortgage loans insured by U.S.
government agencies, were concentrated in California, New York, Florida, Texas
and Illinois, compared with $145.5 billion, or 65% at December 31, 2021.

Average current estimated loan-to-value ("LTV") ratios were relatively flat.

Refer to Note 12 for information on the geographic composition and current
estimated LTVs of the Firm's residential real estate loans.

Modified residential real estate loans

The following table presents information relating to modified retained
residential real estate loans for which concessions have been granted to
borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which include both TDRs and
modified PCD loans not accounted for as TDRs. The following table does not
include loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are
not considered concessions and, therefore, are not TDRs. Refer to Note 12 for
further information on modifications for the years ended December 31, 2022 and
2021.

Management's discussion and analysis

  

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio, including loans at fair
value consists of prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans, as
well as overdrafts. The portfolio decreased when compared with December 31,
2021 due to paydowns of scored Auto loans and PPP loan forgiveness in Business
Banking predominantly offset by originations of scored Auto loans. Net charge-
offs for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased compared to the prior year
due to higher scored Auto and overdraft charge-offs, as the prior year
benefited from government stimulus and payment assistance programs. The scored
Auto net charge-off rates were 0.24% and 0.04% for the years ended December
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Credit card

Total credit card loans increased from December 31, 2021 driven by growth in
balances on higher consumer spending and net new originations. The December
31, 2022 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.45% and 0.68%, respectively,
increased compared to the December 31, 2021 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates
of 1.04% and 0.50%, but remain below pre-pandemic levels. Net charge-offs
decreased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year.
Delinquency and net charge-off rates continue to benefit from the ongoing
financial strength of U.S. consumers. However, median deposit balances
declined in the second half of 2022, impacted by the growth in consumer
spending.

Consistent with the Firm's policy, all credit card loans typically remain on
accrual status until charged off. However, the Firm's allowance for loan
losses includes the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed
interest and fee income.

Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans

At December 31, 2022, $85.4 billion, or 46% of the total retained credit card
loan portfolio, was concentrated in California, Texas, New York, Florida and
Illinois, compared with $70.5 billion, or 46%, at December 31, 2021.

Modifications of credit card loans

At December 31, 2022, the Firm had $796 million of credit card loans
outstanding that have been modified in TDRs, compared to $1.0 billion at
December 31, 2021. These TDRs do not include loans with short-term or other
insignificant modifications that are not considered TDRs.

Refer to Note 12 for further information about this portfolio, including
information about delinquencies, geographic and FICO composition, and
modifications.

Management's discussion and analysis

  

| | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO  
  
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily
through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and hedging activities with
and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating
services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities
financing activities and cash placed with banks. A portion of the loans
originated or acquired by the Firm's wholesale businesses is generally
retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage
of the loans that it originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan
business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale
portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews
of client credit quality and transaction structure, inclusive of collateral
where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations. Refer to
the industry discussion on pages 118-121 for further information.

The Firm's wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM,
and Corporate, as well as the risk-rated BWM and auto dealer exposure held in
CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the
allowance for loan losses.

In 2022, wholesale credit continued to perform well with charge-offs remaining
low.

As of December 31, 2022, retained loans increased by $43.3 billion driven by
CIB and CB, including higher revolver utilization, partially offset by a
decline in AWM. Lending-related commitments decreased $14.5 billion, driven by
net portfolio activity in CIB, including a decrease in held-for-sale positions
in the bridge financing portfolio, largely offset by net portfolio activity in
AWM and CB.

As of December 31, 2022, the investment-grade percentage of the portfolio
remained relatively flat at 70%, while criticized exposure decreased by $6.9
billion from $38.2 billion to $31.3 billion. As of December 31, 2022,
nonperforming exposure decreased by $406.0 million driven by a decline in
lending-related commitments in CIB and loans in AWM as a result of client-
specific upgrades, paydowns and cancelled commitments, largely offset by
client-specific downgrades in CIB including downgrades to certain Russia and
Russia-associated clients in the first quarter of 2022. Refer to Business
Developments on page 50 and Country Risk on pages 139-140 for additional
information. Refer to Wholesale credit exposure - industry exposures on pages
118-121 for additional information.

Wholesale credit exposure - maturity and ratings profile

The following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles
of the wholesale credit portfolio as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Firm
generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics
equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into
consideration collateral and structural support when determining the internal
risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 for further information
on internal risk ratings.

Management's discussion and analysis

  

Wholesale credit exposure - industry exposures

The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry
exposures, and pays particular attention to industries with actual or
potential credit concerns.

Exposures that are deemed to be criticized align with the U.S. banking
regulators' definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the special
mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure,
excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $31.3 billion at
December 31, 2022 and $38.2 billion at December 31, 2021, representing
approximately 2.7% and 3.5% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively.
Criticized exposure decreased driven by net portfolio activity and client-
specific upgrades concentrated in Consumer & Retail, Technology, Media &
Telecommunications and Real Estate, largely offset by client-specific
downgrades. Of the $31.3 billion of criticized exposure at December 31, 2022,
approximately half was undrawn and $28.6 billion was performing.

The table below summarizes by industry the Firm's exposures as of December 31,
2022 and 2021. The industry of risk category is generally based on the client
or counterparty's primary business activity. Refer to Note 4 for additional
information on industry concentrations.

Management's discussion and analysis

  

Lending-related commitments

The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments
(including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to address the
financing needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these financial
instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw
down on these commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations under
these guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to
the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees have
historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being
drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that
the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is
representative of the Firm's expected future credit exposure or funding
requirements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on wholesale lending-
related commitments.

Receivables from customers

Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to
brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets
maintained in the clients' brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and
liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this
collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is generally held against
these receivables. To manage its credit risk, the Firm establishes margin
requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and
requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce
positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued
interest and accounts receivable on the Firm's Consolidated balance sheets.

Derivative contracts

Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk, including credit
risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange
and equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in
order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks
associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities,
including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables.
The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and
other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement
mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is
exposed. For OTC derivatives, the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the
derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives ("ETD"), such as
futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter ("OTC-cleared") derivatives,
the Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where
possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from
derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable master netting
arrangements and collateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm's OTC
derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements -- excluding foreign
exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements
due to their short

maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily -- was
approximately 87% and 88% at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Refer
to Note 5 for additional information on the Firm's use of collateral
agreements and further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties and
settlement types.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance
sheets were $70.9 billion and $57.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. The increase was primarily driven by higher foreign exchange as
a result of market movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value
of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master
netting agreements and the related cash collateral held by the Firm.

In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash collateral that
may be used as security when the fair value of the client's exposure is in the
Firm's favor. For these purposes, the definition of liquid securities is
consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the
LCR rule.

In management's view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should
also take into consideration other collateral, which generally represents
securities that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR
rule. The benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each
counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement and
limited to the net amount of the derivative receivables for each counterparty.

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government
securities, other liquid government agency and guaranteed securities, and
corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation
of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-
daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has
not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not
reduce the balances and is not included in the tables below, it is available
as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value
of the client's derivative contracts move in the Firm's favor. Refer to Note 5
for additional information on the Firm's use of collateral agreements.

The following tables summarize the net derivative receivables and the internal
ratings profile for the periods presented.

While useful as a current view of credit exposure, the net fair value of the
derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of
that credit exposure. To capture the potential future variability of credit
exposure, the Firm calculates, on a client-by-client basis, three measures of
potential derivatives-related credit loss: Peak, Derivative Risk Equivalent
("DRE"), and Average exposure ("AVG"). These measures all incorporate netting
and collateral benefits, where applicable.

Peak represents a conservative measure of potential derivative exposure,
including the benefit of collateral, to a counterparty calculated in a manner
that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% confidence level over the life of the
transaction. Peak is the primary measure used by the Firm for setting credit
limits for derivative contracts, senior management reporting and derivatives
exposure management.

DRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure,
including the benefit of collateral, on a basis intended to be equivalent to
the risk of loan exposures. DRE is a less extreme measure of potential credit
loss than Peak and is used as an input for aggregating derivative credit risk
exposures with loans and other credit risk.

Finally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of the Firm's derivative
exposure, including the benefit of collateral, at future time periods. AVG
over the total life of the derivative contract is used as the primary metric
for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit risk capital and CVA, as
further described below.

The fair value of the Firm's derivative receivables incorporates CVA to
reflect the credit quality of counterparties. CVA is based on the Firm's AVG
to a counterparty and the counterparty's credit spread in the credit
derivatives market. The Firm believes that active risk management is essential
to controlling the dynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio. In
addition, the Firm's risk

management process for derivatives exposures takes into consideration the
potential impact of wrong-way risk, which is broadly defined as the risk that
exposure to a counterparty is positively correlated with the impact of a
default by the same counterparty, which could cause exposure to increase at
the same time as the counterparty's capacity to meet its obligations is
decreasing. Many factors may influence the nature and magnitude of these
correlations over time. To the extent that these correlations are identified,
the Firm may adjust the CVA associated with a particular counterparty's AVG.
The Firm risk manages exposure to changes in CVA by entering into credit
derivative contracts, as well as interest rate, foreign exchange, equity and
commodity derivative contracts.

The below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm's current derivatives
portfolio over the next 10 years as calculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG
metrics. The three measures generally show that exposure will decline after
the first year, if no new trades are added to the portfolio.

Management's discussion and analysis

  

Credit derivatives

The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its
capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-user to manage the Firm's
own credit risk associated with various exposures.

Credit portfolio management activities

Included in the Firm's end-user activities are credit derivatives used to
mitigate the credit risk associated with traditional lending activities (loans
and lending-related commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the
Firm's wholesale businesses (collectively, "credit portfolio management
activities"). Information on credit portfolio management activities is
provided in the table below.

The Firm also uses credit derivatives as an end-user to manage other
exposures, including credit risk arising from certain securities held in the
Firm's market-making businesses. These credit derivatives are not included in
credit portfolio management activities.

(a)Amounts are presented net, considering the Firm's net protection purchased

(b)Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current
presentation

The credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities do not
qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP; these derivatives are reported
at fair value, with gains and losses recognized in principal transactions
revenue. In contrast, the loans and lending-related commitments being risk-
managed are accounted for on an accrual basis. This asymmetry in accounting
treatment, between loans and lending-related commitments and the credit
derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities, causes earnings
volatility that is not representative, in the Firm's view, of the true changes
in value of the Firm's overall credit exposure.

The effectiveness of credit default swaps ("CDS") as a hedge against the
Firm's exposures may vary depending on a number of factors, including the
named reference entity (i.e., the Firm may experience losses on specific
exposures that are different than the named reference entities in the
purchased CDS); the contractual terms of the CDS (which may have a defined
credit event that does not align with an actual loss realized by the Firm);
and the maturity of the Firm's CDS protection (which in some cases may be
shorter than the Firm's exposures). However, the Firm generally seeks to
purchase credit protection with a maturity date that is the same or similar to
the maturity date of the exposure for which the protection was purchased, and
remaining differences in maturity are actively monitored and managed by the
Firm. Refer to Credit derivatives in Note 5 for further information on credit
derivatives and derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  
  
The Firm's allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of
expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's
financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments. The Firm's allowance for credit losses comprises:

•the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm's retained loan
portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the
Consolidated balance sheets,

•the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is reflected in accounts
payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, and

•the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected
in investment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Discussion of changes in the allowance

The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2022 was $22.2 billion,
reflecting a net addition of $3.5 billion from December 31, 2021, consisting
of:

•$2.3 billion in wholesale, driven by deterioration in the Firm's
macroeconomic outlook and loan growth, predominantly in CB and CIB, and

•$1.2 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting
higher outstanding balances and deterioration in the Firm's macroeconomic
outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a
decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of
the pandemic gradually recede.

Deterioration in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook included both updates to the
central scenario in the fourth quarter of 2022, which now reflects a mild
recession, as well as the impact of the increased weight placed on the adverse
scenarios beginning in the first quarter of 2022 due to the effects associated
with higher inflation, changes in monetary policy, and geopolitical risks,
including the war in Ukraine.

The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average
of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case
assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a weighted average U.S.
unemployment rate peaking at 5.6% in the second quarter of 2024, and a 1.2%
lower U.S. real GDP exiting the second quarter of 2024.

Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates

will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future

periods.

modified in a TDR is calculated based on the loans' original contractual
interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates.

(b)At December 31, 2022, excludes an allowance for credit losses associated
with certain accounts receivable in CIB of $21 million.

(c)The Firm's policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being
placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT  
  
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss of principal or
a reduction in expected returns on investments arising from the investment
securities portfolio or from principal investments. The investment securities
portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the
Firm's balance sheet and asset-liability management objectives. Principal
investments are predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are
managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically intended to be
held over extended periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for
short-term realized gains with respect to these investments.

Investment securities risk

Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a default in
the payment of principal and interest. This risk is mitigated given that the
investment securities portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly
consists of high-quality securities. At December 31, 2022, the Treasury and
CIO investment securities portfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses,
was $629.3 billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising
the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where
not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate
segment results on pages 79-80 and Note 10 for further information on the
investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. Refer to Liquidity
Risk Management on pages 97-104 for further information on related liquidity
risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 131-138 for further information
on the market risk inherent in the portfolio.

Governance and oversight

Investment securities risks are governed by the Firm's Risk Appetite
framework, and reviewed at the CTC Risk Committee with regular updates
provided to the Board Risk Committee.

The Firm's independent control functions are responsible for reviewing the
appropriateness of the carrying value of investment securities in accordance
with relevant policies. Approved levels for investment securities are
established for each risk category, including capital and credit risks.

Principal investment risk

Principal investments are typically privately-held financial instruments
representing ownership interests or other forms of junior capital. In general,
principal investments include tax-oriented investments and investments made to
enhance or accelerate the Firm's business strategies and exclude those that
are consolidated on the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are made by
dedicated investing businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. The
Firm's principal investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and are
reflected within their respective financial results. The Firm's investments
will continue to evolve in line with its strategies, including the Firm's
commitment to support underserved communities and minority-owned businesses.

The table below presents the aggregate carrying values of the principal
investment portfolios as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Total carrying value| $| 37.0 | | | $| 30.5 |  
  
(a)Includes the Firm's 40% ownership in C6 Bank and 49% ownership in Viva

Governance and oversight

The Firm's approach to managing principal risk is consistent with the Firm's
risk governance structure. The Firm has established a Firmwide risk policy
framework for all principal investing activities that includes approval by
executives who are independent from the investing businesses, as appropriate.

The Firm's independent control functions are responsible for reviewing the
appropriateness of the carrying value of investments in accordance with
relevant policies. As part of the risk governance structure, approved levels
for investments are established and monitored for each relevant business or
segment in order to manage the overall size of the portfolios. The Firm also
conducts stress testing on these portfolios using specific scenarios that
estimate losses based on significant market moves and/or other risk events.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  
  
Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market
factors such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity
prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and
liabilities held for both the short and long term.

Market Risk Management

Market Risk Management monitors market risks throughout the Firm and defines
market risk policies and procedures.

Market Risk Management seeks to manage risk, facilitate efficient risk/return
decisions, reduce volatility in operating performance and provide transparency
into the Firm's market risk profile for senior management, the Board of
Directors and regulators. Market Risk Management is responsible for the
following functions:

•Maintaining a market risk policy framework

•Independently measuring, monitoring and controlling LOB, Corporate, and
Firmwide market risk

•Defining, approving and monitoring of limits

•Performing stress testing and qualitative risk assessments

Risk measurement

Measures used to capture market risk

There is no single measure to capture market risk and therefore Market Risk
Management uses various metrics, both statistical and nonstatistical, to
assess risk including:

•Value-at-risk (VaR)

•Stress testing

•Profit and loss drawdowns

•Earnings-at-risk

•Other sensitivity-based measures

Risk monitoring and control

Market risk exposure is managed primarily through a series of limits set in
the context of the market environment and business strategy. In setting
limits, Market Risk Management takes into consideration factors such as market
volatility, product liquidity, accommodation of client business, and
management judgment. Market Risk Management maintains different levels of
limits. Firm level limits include VaR and stress limits. Similarly, LOB and
Corporate limits include VaR and stress limits and may be supplemented by
certain nonstatistical risk measures such as profit and loss drawdowns. Limits
may also be set within the LOBs and Corporate, as well as at the legal entity
level.

Market Risk Management sets limits and regularly reviews and updates them as
appropriate. Senior management is responsible for reviewing and approving
certain of these risk limits on an ongoing basis. Limits that have not been
reviewed within specified time periods by Market Risk Management are reported
to senior management. The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for adhering to
established limits against which exposures are monitored and reported.

Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner to limit
approvers, which include Market Risk Management and senior management. In the
event of a breach, Market Risk Management consults with senior members of
appropriate groups within the Firm to determine the suitable course of action
required to return the applicable positions to compliance, which may include a
reduction in risk in order to remedy the breach or granting a temporary
increase in limits to accommodate an expected increase in client activity
and/or market volatility. Certain Firm, Corporate or LOB-level limit breaches
are escalated as appropriate.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently imprecise and are limited in
their ability to measure certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision
may be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market conditions occur. For
additional discussion on model uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 148.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm's existing market risk
measures to identify opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent
appropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly over time.

Management's discussion and analysis

  

The following table summarizes the predominant business activities and related
market risks, as well as positions which give rise to market risk and certain
measures used to capture those risks, for each LOB and Corporate.

In addition to the predominant business activities, each LOB and Corporate may

Value-at-risk

JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk ("VaR"), a statistical risk measure, to
estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in the current market
environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used as a basis for
calculating Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.

The framework is employed across the Firm using historical simulation based on
data for the previous 12 months. The framework's approach assumes that
historical changes in market values are representative of the distribution of
potential outcomes in the immediate future. The Firm believes the use of Risk
Management VaR provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to
risk management decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other
market risk measures, provides the appropriate information needed to respond
to risk events.

The Firm's Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period
and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% confidence
level. Risk Management VaR provides a consistent framework to measure risk
profiles and levels of diversification across product types and is used for
aggregating risks and monitoring limits across businesses. VaR results are
reported to senior management, the Board of Directors and regulators.

Underlying the overall VaR model framework are individual VaR models that
simulate historical market returns for individual risk factors and/or product
types. To capture material market risks as part of the Firm's risk management
framework, comprehensive VaR model calculations are performed daily for
businesses whose activities give rise to market risk. These VaR models are
granular and incorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to simulate daily
changes in market values over the historical period; inputs are selected based
on the risk profile of each portfolio, as sensitivities and historical time
series used to generate daily market values may be different across product
types or risk management systems. The VaR model results across all portfolios
are aggregated at the Firm level.

As VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect measure of market risk
exposure and potential future losses. In addition, based on their reliance on
available historical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, VaR
measures are inherently limited in their ability to measure certain risks and
to predict losses, particularly those associated with market illiquidity and
sudden or severe shifts in market conditions.

For certain products, specific risk parameters are not captured in VaR due to
the lack of liquidity and availability of appropriate historical data. The
Firm uses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other products when daily
time series are not available. It is likely that using an actual price-based
time series for these products, if available, would affect the VaR results
presented. The Firm therefore considers other nonstatistical measures such as
stress

testing, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its market risk positions.

The daily market data used in VaR models may be different than the independent
third-party data collected for VCG price testing in its monthly valuation
process. For example, in cases where market prices are not observable, or
where proxies are used in VaR historical time series, the data sources may
differ. Refer to Valuation process in Note 2 for further information on the
Firm's valuation process. As VaR model calculations require daily data and a
consistent source for valuation, it may not be practical to use the data
collected in the VCG monthly valuation process for VaR model calculations.

The Firm's VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in
response to changes in the composition of the Firm's portfolios, changes in
market conditions, improvements in the Firm's modeling techniques and
measurements, and other factors. Such changes may affect historical
comparisons of VaR results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on
page 148 for information regarding model reviews and approvals.

The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with
regulatory rules ("Regulatory VaR"), which is used to derive the Firm's
regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III capital rules. This
Regulatory VaR model framework currently assumes a ten business-day holding
period and an expected tail loss methodology which approximates a 99%
confidence level. Regulatory VaR is applied to "covered" positions as defined
by Basel III capital rules, which may be different than the positions included
in the Firm's Risk Management VaR. For example, credit derivative hedges of
accrual loans are included in the Firm's Risk Management VaR, while Regulatory
VaR excludes these credit derivative hedges. In addition, in contrast to the
Firm's Risk Management VaR, Regulatory VaR currently excludes the
diversification benefit for certain VaR models.

Refer to JPMorgan Chase's Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures
reports, which are available on the Firm's website, for additional information
on Regulatory VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory capital
for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the
respective backtesting).

(a)Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR
and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the non-additive
nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk
types.

(b)In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's internal model
governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties
was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit
spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were
also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other
sensitivity-based measures.

(c)In March 2022, the effects of nickel price increases and the associated
volatility in the nickel market resulted in elevated average and maximum
Credit Portfolio VaR.

(d)The decrease in Corporate and other LOB VaR was driven by lower market
values for a legacy private equity position in Corporate which is publicly
traded.

(e)The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on
different trading days than the components, and consequently, diversification
benefit is not meaningful.

Average Total VaR increased by $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022
when compared with the prior year. The increase was driven by the effects of
nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market
observed in March 2022 impacting Credit Portfolio VaR, predominantly offset by
a decrease in Corporate and other LOB VaR.

The following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the four trailing
quarters. The movement in VaR in March 2022 was driven by changes in nickel-
related counterparty exposure in the Firm's Credit Portfolio.

VaR backtesting

The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk
Management VaR results with the daily gains and losses that are utilized for
VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do
not reflect the Firm's reported revenue as they exclude certain components of
total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of new
transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk
management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net
interest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than
offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The definition of
backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for
backtesting under Basel III capital rules.

A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the
daily Risk Management VaR for the prior day. Under the Firm's Risk Management
VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with
the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur
VaR backtesting exceptions five times every 100 trading days on average. The
number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the
statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level
of market volatility is materially different from the level of market
volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR
calculation.

For the 12 months ended December 31, 2022, the Firm posted backtesting gains
on 136 of the 259 days, and observed 17 VaR backtesting exceptions. Firmwide
backtesting loss days can differ from the loss days for which Fixed Income
Markets and Equity Markets posted losses, as disclosed in CIB Markets revenue,
as the population of positions which compose each metric are different and due
to the exclusion of certain components of total net revenue in backtesting
gains and losses as described above. For more information on CIB Markets
revenue, refer to pages 70-71.

The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting
gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and three months ended December
31, 2022. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the
corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting
losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals.
Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater
than one hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the
results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm's
Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on
Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm's covered positions.

Management's discussion and analysis

Other risk measures

Stress testing

Along with VaR, stress testing is an important tool used to assess risk. While
VaR reflects the risk of loss due to adverse changes in markets using recent
historical market behavior, stress testing reflects the risk of loss from
hypothetical changes in the value of market risk sensitive positions applied
simultaneously. Stress testing measures the Firm's vulnerability to losses
under a range of stressed but possible economic and market scenarios. The
results are used to understand the exposures responsible for those potential
losses and are measured against limits.

The Firm's stress framework covers market risk sensitive positions in the LOBs
and Corporate. The framework is used to calculate multiple magnitudes of
potential stress for both market rallies and market sell-offs, assuming
significant changes in market factors such as credit spreads, equity prices,
interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, and combines them in
multiple ways to capture an array of hypothetical economic and market
scenarios.

The Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on tail events in specific
asset classes and geographies, including how the event may impact multiple
market factors simultaneously. Scenarios also incorporate specific
idiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk between different products. The
flexibility in the stress framework allows the Firm to construct new scenarios
that can test the outcomes against possible future stress events. Stress
testing results are reported periodically to senior management of the Firm, as
appropriate.

Stress scenarios are governed by the overall stress framework, under the
oversight of Market Risk Management, and the models to calculate the stress
results are subject to the Firm's Estimations and Model Risk Management
Policy. The Firmwide Market Risk Stress Methodology Committee reviews and
approves changes to stress testing methodology and scenarios across the Firm.
Significant changes to the framework are escalated to senior management, as
appropriate.

The Firm's stress testing framework is utilized in calculating the Firm's CCAR
and other stress test results, which are reported periodically to the Board of
Directors. In addition, stress testing results are incorporated into the
Firm's Risk Appetite framework, and are reported periodically to the Board
Risk Committee.

Profit and loss drawdowns

Profit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight trading losses above certain
levels of risk tolerance. A profit and loss drawdown is a decline in revenue
from its year-to-date peak level.

Earnings-at-risk

The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm's reported net income is
important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm's significant
market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but
also from the

Firm's traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and
credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt and the investment securities
portfolio. Refer to the table on page 132 for a summary by LOB and Corporate,
identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.

The CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm's structural interest rate risk
policy and related limits, which are subject to approval by the Board Risk
Committee. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, calculates
the Firm's structural interest rate risk profile and reviews it with senior
management, including the CTC Risk Committee. In addition, oversight of
structural interest rate risk is managed through a dedicated risk function
reporting to the CTC CRO. This risk function is responsible for providing
independent oversight and governance around assumptions and establishing and
monitoring limits for structural interest rate risk. The Firm manages
structural interest rate risk generally through its investment securities
portfolio and interest rate derivatives.

Structural interest rate risk can arise due to a variety of factors,
including:

•Differences in timing among the maturity or repricing of assets, liabilities
and off-balance sheet instruments

•Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet
instruments that are maturing or repricing at the same time

•Differences in the amounts by which short-term and long-term market interest
rates change (for example, changes in the slope of the yield curve)

•The impact of changes in the maturity of various assets, liabilities or off-
balance sheet instruments as interest rates change

The Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities
on a consolidated, Firmwide basis. Business units transfer their interest rate
risk to Treasury and CIO through funds transfer pricing, which takes into
account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be risk-managed in
financial markets. These elements include asset and liability balances and
contractual rates of interest, contractual principal payment schedules,
expected prepayment experience, interest rate reset dates and maturities, rate
indices used for repricing, and any interest rate ceilings or floors for
adjustable rate products.

One way that the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through
earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm's interest rate exposure
for a given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a
baseline, which includes net interest income and certain interest rate
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and, in the case of
deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to
this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated
in U.S. dollars and other currencies ("non-U.S. dollar" currencies). These
simulations primarily include retained loans,

deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long-term debt and any
related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of other positions in
risk management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page
132.

Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net interest
income baseline over the following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions.
These scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term
and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving
holding short-term rates constant and increasing long-term rates; and a
flatter yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-
term rates constant or holding short-term rates constant and decreasing long-
term rates. These scenarios consider many different factors, including:

•The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest
rates from baseline rates.

•Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment
behavior, but excluding assumptions about actions that could be taken by the
Firm or its clients and customers in response to instantaneous rate changes.
Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the
scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since
origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on
historical experience. Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in the Firm's
earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects certain assumptions relating to the
reversal of Quantitative Easing that are highly uncertain and require
management judgment. Therefore, the actual amount of deposits held by the
Firm, at any particular time, could be impacted by actions the Federal Reserve
may take as part of monetary policy, including through the use of the Reverse
Repurchase Facility. In addition, there are other factors that impact the
amount of deposits held at the Firm such as the level of loans across the
industry and competition for deposits.

•The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas, represent the
amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market
interest rates. The deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ from actual
deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and other factors.

The Firm's earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced
in response to changes in the composition of the Firm's balance sheet, changes
in market conditions, improvements in the Firm's simulation and other factors.
The Firm is currently evaluating the modeling of repricing lags for deposits
in its earnings-at-risk scenarios. Incorporating repricing lags, in the
current environment, would significantly affect the U.S. dollar interest rate
scenarios, with higher interest rate scenarios expected to result in a
positive impact, and lower interest rate scenarios expected to result in a
negative impact, on the Firm's earnings-at-risk. While a relevant measure of
the

Firm's interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does not
represent a forecast of the Firm's net interest income (Refer to Outlook on
page 49 for additional information).

The Firm's U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below.

The change in the Firm's U.S. dollar sensitivities as of December 31, 2022
compared to December 31, 2021 reflected updates to the Firm's baseline for
higher interest rates and higher corresponding modeled deposit betas, as well
as the impact of changes in the Firm's balance sheet.

As of December 31, 2022, the Firm's sensitivity to the +/-100 basis points
parallel and short-term shift in rates is primarily the result of a greater
impact from liabilities repricing compared to the impact of assets repricing,
while a +/-100 basis points shift in long-term rates is primarily the result
of a greater impact from assets repricing compared to the impact of
liabilities repricing.

The Firm's non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below.

basis points and short-term rates staying at current levels were not material
to the Firm's earnings-at-risk at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Management's discussion and analysis

Non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk

Non-U.S. dollar FX risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates
affect the value of the Firm's assets or liabilities or future results. The
Firm has structural non-U.S. dollar FX exposures arising from capital
investments, forecasted expense and revenue, the investment securities
portfolio and non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt issuance. Treasury and CIO,
working in partnership with the LOBs, primarily manage these risks on behalf
of the Firm. Treasury and CIO may hedge certain of these risks using
derivatives. Refer to Business Segment Results on page 62 for additional
information.

Other sensitivity-based measures

The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and
funding-related exposures by assessing the potential impact on net revenue,
other comprehensive income ("OCI") and noninterest expense due to changes in
relevant market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that
give rise to market risk on page 132 for additional information on the
positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures.

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or
noninterest expense for market risk sensitive instruments that are not
included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for
hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged. The
sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the
actual gain or loss that would have been realized at December 31, 2022 and
2021, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are
not intended to imply management's expectation of future changes in these
sensitivities.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT  
  
The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed to country risk
resulting from financial, economic, political or other significant
developments which adversely affect the value of the Firm's exposures related
to a particular country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management group
actively monitors the various portfolios which may be impacted by these
developments and measures the extent to which the Firm's exposures are
diversified given the Firm's strategy and risk tolerance relative to a
country.

Organization and management

Country Risk Management is an independent risk management function that
assesses, manages and monitors exposure to country risk across the Firm.

The Firm's country risk management function includes the following activities:

•Maintaining policies, procedures and standards consistent with a
comprehensive country risk framework

•Assigning sovereign ratings, assessing country risks and establishing risk
tolerance relative to a country

•Measuring and monitoring country risk exposure and stress across the Firm

•Managing and approving country limits and reporting trends and limit breaches
to senior management

•Developing surveillance tools, such as signaling models and ratings
indicators, for early identification of potential country risk concerns

•Providing country risk scenario analysis

Sources and measurement

The Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending and deposits,
investing, and market-making activities, whether cross-border or locally
funded. Country exposure includes activity with both government and private-
sector entities in a country.

Under the Firm's internal country risk management approach, attribution of
exposure to an individual country is based on the country where the largest
proportion of the assets of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor are
located or where the largest proportion of its revenue is derived, which may
be different than the domicile (i.e. legal residence) or country of
incorporation.

Individual country exposures reflect an aggregation of the Firm's risk to an
immediate default, with zero recovery, of the counterparties, issuers,
obligors or guarantors attributed to that country. Activities which result in
contingent or indirect exposure to a country are not included in the country
exposure measure (for example, providing clearing services or secondary
exposure to collateral on securities financing receivables).

Assumptions are sometimes required in determining the measurement and
allocation of country exposure, particularly in the case of certain non-linear
or index products, or where the nature of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or
guarantor is not suitable for attribution to an

individual country. The use of different measurement approaches or assumptions
could affect the amount of reported country exposure.

Under the Firm's internal country risk measurement framework:

•Deposits with banks are measured as the cash balances placed with central
banks, commercial banks, and other financial institutions

•Lending exposures are measured at the total committed amount (funded and
unfunded), net of the allowance for credit losses and eligible cash and
marketable securities collateral received

•Securities financing exposures are measured at their receivable balance, net
of eligible collateral received

•Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair value of all positions,
including both long and short positions

•Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is measured at the
derivative's fair value, net of the fair value of the eligible collateral
received

•Credit derivatives exposure is measured at the net notional amount of
protection purchased or sold for the same underlying reference entity,
inclusive of the fair value of the derivative receivable or payable,
reflecting the manner in which the Firm manages these exposures

The Firm's internal country risk reporting differs from the reporting provided
under the FFIEC bank regulatory requirements.

Management's discussion and analysis

Stress testing

Stress testing is an important component of the Firm's country risk management
framework, which aims to estimate and limit losses arising from a country
crisis by measuring the impact of adverse asset price movements to a country
based on market shocks combined with counterparty specific assumptions.
Country Risk Management periodically designs and runs tailored stress
scenarios to test vulnerabilities to individual countries or sets of countries
in response to specific or potential market events, sector performance
concerns, sovereign actions and geopolitical risks. These tailored stress
results are used to inform potential risk reduction across the Firm, as
necessary.

Risk reporting

Country exposure and stress are measured and reported regularly, and used by
Country Risk Management to identify trends and monitor high usages and
breaches against limits.

For country risk management purposes, the Firm may report exposure to
jurisdictions that are not fully autonomous, including Special Administrative
Regions ("SAR") and dependent territories, separately from the independent
sovereign states with which they are associated.

The following table presents the Firm's top 20 exposures by country (excluding
the U.S.) as of December 31, 2022, and their comparative exposures as of
December 31, 2021. The selection of countries represents the Firm's largest
total exposures by individual country, based on the Firm's internal country
risk management approach, and does not represent the Firm's view of any
existing or potentially adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may
fluctuate from period to period due to client activity and market flows.

The increase in exposure to Germany and the decrease in exposure to the U.K.
were primarily due to changes in cash placements with the central banks of
those countries driven by balance sheet and liquidity management activities.

The decrease in exposure to Australia was driven by reductions in cash placed
with the central bank of Australia and government debt securities, due to
client-driven market-making activities and lower client cash deposits
resulting from higher interest rates.

As of December 31, 2022, exposure to Russia was approximately $500 million.
This amount excludes certain deposits placed on behalf of clients, largely at
the Russian National Settlement Depository. In accordance with requirements of
the Bank of Russia, these deposits were transferred to the Depository
Insurance Agency of Russia on February 3, 2023.

CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT  
  
Climate risk is the risk associated with the impacts of climate change on the
Firm's clients, customers, operations and business strategy. Climate change is
viewed as a driver of risk that may impact existing types of risks managed by
the Firm. Climate risk is categorized into physical risk and transition risk.

Physical risk refers to economic costs and financial loss associated with a
changing climate. Acute physical risk drivers include the increased frequency
or severity of climate and weather events, such as floods, wildfires and
tropical storms. Chronic physical risk drivers include more gradual shifts in
the climate, such as rising sea levels, persistent changes in precipitation
levels and increases in average ambient temperatures.

Transition risk refers to the financial and economic implications associated
with a societal adjustment to a low-carbon economy. Transition risk drivers
include possible changes in public policy, adoption of new technologies and
shifts in consumer preferences. Transition risks may also be influenced by
changes in the physical climate.

Organization and management

The Firm has a Climate Risk Management function that is responsible for
establishing the Firmwide framework and strategy for managing climate risk.
The Climate Risk Management function engages across the Firm to help integrate
climate risk considerations into existing risk management frameworks, as
appropriate.

Other responsibilities of Climate Risk Management include:

•Setting policies, standards, procedures and processes to support
identification, escalation, monitoring and management of climate risk across
the Firm

•Developing metrics, scenarios, and stress testing mechanisms designed to
assess the range of potential climate-related financial and economic impacts
to the Firm

•Establishing a Firmwide climate risk data strategy and the supporting climate
risk technology infrastructure

The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the identification, assessment and
management of climate risks present in their business activities and for
adherence to applicable climate-related laws, rules and regulations.

Governance and oversight

The Firm's approach to managing climate risk is consistent with the Firm's
risk governance structure. The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for
integrating climate risk management into existing governance frameworks, or
creating new governance frameworks, as appropriate.

The LOBs, Corporate and Climate Risk Management are responsible for providing
the Board Risk Committee with information on significant climate risks and
climate-related initiatives, as appropriate.

Management's discussion and analysis

---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT  
  
Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate
or failed internal processes or systems; human factors; or external events
impacting the Firm's processes or systems. Operational Risk includes
compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. Operational risk
is inherent in the Firm's activities and can manifest itself in various ways,
including fraudulent acts, business disruptions (including those caused by
extraordinary events beyond the Firm's control), cyber attacks, inappropriate
employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and
regulations or failure of vendors or other third party providers to perform in
accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk Management attempts to
manage operational risk at appropriate levels in light of the Firm's financial
position, the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and
regulatory environments in which it operates.

Operational Risk Management Framework

The Firm's Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk ("CCOR") Management
Framework is designed to enable the Firm to govern, identify, measure, monitor
and test, manage and report on the Firm's operational risk.

Operational Risk Governance

The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the management of operational risk.
The Control Management Organization, which consists of control managers within
each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for the day-to-day execution of the
CCOR Framework.

The Firm's Global Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO") and FRE for Operational
Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite is responsible for defining the CCOR
Management Framework and establishing the minimum standards for its execution.
The LOB and Corporate aligned CCOR Lead Officers report to the Global CCO and
FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite and are independent of
the respective businesses or functions they oversee. The CCOR Management
Framework is included in the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy that is
reviewed and approved by the Board Risk Committee periodically.

Operational Risk Identification

The Firm utilizes a structured risk and control self-assessment process that
is executed by the LOBs and Corporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and
Corporate evaluate the effectiveness of their respective control environment
to assess where controls have failed, and to determine where remediation
efforts may be required. The Firm's Operational Risk and Compliance
organization ("Operational Risk and Compliance") provides oversight of and
challenge to these evaluations and may also perform independent assessments of
significant operational risk events and areas of concentrated or emerging
risk.

Operational Risk Measurement

Operational Risk and Compliance performs an independent assessment of the
operational risks inherent within the LOBs and Corporate, which includes
evaluating the effectiveness of the control environments and reporting the
results to senior management.

In addition, Operational Risk and Compliance assesses operational risks
through quantitative means, including operational risk-based capital and
estimation of operational risk losses under both baseline and stressed
conditions.

The primary component of the operational risk capital estimate is the Loss
Distribution Approach ("LDA") statistical model, which simulates the frequency
and severity of future operational risk loss projections based on historical
data. The LDA model is used to estimate an aggregate operational risk loss
over a one-year time horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level. The LDA model
incorporates actual internal operational risk losses in the quarter following
the period in which those losses were realized, and the calculation generally
continues to reflect such losses even after the issues or business activities
giving rise to the losses have been remediated or reduced.

As required under the Basel III capital framework, the Firm's operational
risk-based capital methodology, which uses the Advanced Measurement Approach
("AMA"), incorporates internal and external losses as well as management's
view of tail risk captured through operational risk scenario analysis, and
evaluation of key business environment and internal control metrics. The Firm
does not reflect the impact of insurance in its AMA estimate of operational
risk capital.

The Firm considers the impact of stressed economic conditions on operational
risk losses and develops a forward looking view of material operational risk
events that may occur in a stressed environment. The Firm's operational risk
stress testing framework is utilized in calculating results for the Firm's
CCAR and other stress testing processes.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for information related to
operational risk RWA, and CCAR.

Operational Risk Monitoring and testing

The results of risk assessments performed by Operational Risk and Compliance
are used in connection with their independent monitoring and testing
compliance of the LOBs and Corporate with laws, rules and regulations. Through
monitoring and testing, Operational Risk and Compliance independently identify
areas of heightened operational risk and tests the effectiveness of controls
within the LOBs and Corporate.

Management of Operational Risk

The operational risk areas or issues identified through monitoring and testing
are escalated to the LOBs and Corporate to be remediated through action plans,
as needed, to mitigate operational risk. Operational Risk and Compliance may
advise the LOBs and Corporate in the development and implementation of action
plans.

Operational Risk Reporting

All employees of the Firm are expected to escalate risks appropriately. Risks
identified by Operational Risk and Compliance are escalated to the appropriate
LOB and Corporate Control Committees, as needed. Operational Risk and
Compliance has established standards designed to ensure that consistent
operational risk reporting and operational risk reports are produced on a
Firmwide basis as well as by the LOBs and Corporate. Reporting includes the
evaluation of key risk and performance indicators against established
thresholds as well as the assessment of different types of operational risk
against stated risk appetite. The standards reinforce escalation protocols to
senior management and to the Board of Directors.

Subcategories and examples of operational risks

Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways. Operational risk
subcategories include Compliance risk, Conduct risk, Legal risk, and
Estimations and Model risk. Refer to pages 145, 146, 147 and 148, respectively
for more information on Compliance, Conduct, Legal, and Estimations and Model
risk. Details on other select examples of operational risks such as
cybersecurity, business and technology resiliency, payment fraud and third-
party outsourcing are provided below.

War in Ukraine and Sanctions

In response to the war in Ukraine, numerous financial and economic sanctions
have been imposed on Russia and Russia-associated entities and individuals by
various governments around the world, including the authorities in the U.S.,
U.K. and EU. These sanctions are complex and continue to evolve. The Firm
continues to face increased operational risk associated with addressing these
complex compliance-related matters. To manage this increased risk, the Firm
has implemented controls reasonably designed to mitigate the risk of non-
compliance and to prevent dealing with sanctioned persons or in property
subject to sanctions, as well as to block or restrict payments as required by
the applicable regulations.

Cybersecurity risk

Cybersecurity risk is the risk of the Firm's exposure to harm or loss
resulting from misuse or abuse of technology by malicious actors.
Cybersecurity risk is an important and continuously evolving focus for the
Firm. Significant resources are devoted to protecting and enhancing the
security of computer systems, software, networks, storage devices, and other
technology assets. The Firm's security efforts are designed to protect
against, among other things, cybersecurity attacks by unauthorized parties
attempting to obtain access to confidential information, destroy data,

disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage.

The Firm has experienced, and expects that it will continue to experience, a
higher volume and complexity of cyber attacks against the backdrop of
heightened geopolitical tensions. The Firm has implemented precautionary
measures and controls reasonably designed to address this increased risk, such
as enhanced threat monitoring. There can be no assurance that the measures
taken by the Firm will be successful in defending against cyber attacks.

Ongoing business expansions may expose the Firm to potential new threats as
well as expanded regulatory scrutiny including the introduction of new
cybersecurity requirements. The Firm continues to make significant investments
in enhancing its cyber defense capabilities and to strengthen its partnerships
with the appropriate government and law enforcement agencies and other
businesses in order to understand the full spectrum of cybersecurity risks in
the operating environment, enhance defenses and improve resiliency against
cybersecurity threats. The Firm actively participates in discussions and
simulations of cybersecurity risks both internally and with law enforcement,
government officials, peer and industry groups, and has significantly
increased efforts to educate employees and certain clients on the topic of
cybersecurity risks.

Third parties with which the Firm does business or that facilitate the Firm's
business activities (e.g., vendors, supply chain, exchanges, clearing houses,
central depositories, and financial intermediaries) are also sources of
cybersecurity risk to the Firm. Third party cybersecurity incidents such as
system breakdowns or failures, misconduct by the employees of such parties, or
cyber attacks, including ransomware and supply-chain compromises, could affect
their ability to deliver a product or service to the Firm or result in lost or
compromised information of the Firm or its clients. Clients are also sources
of cybersecurity risk to the Firm and its information assets, particularly
when their activities and systems are beyond the Firm's own security and
control systems. As a result, the Firm engages in regular and ongoing
discussions with certain vendors and clients regarding cybersecurity risks and
opportunities to improve security. However, where cybersecurity incidents
occur as a result of client failures to maintain the security of their own
systems and processes, clients are responsible for losses incurred.

To help safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the
Firm's infrastructure, resources and information, the Firm maintains a
Information Security Program designed to prevent, detect, and respond to
cyberattacks. The Board of Directors is periodically provided with updates on
the Firm's Information Security Program, recommended changes, cybersecurity
policies and practices, ongoing efforts to improve security, as well as the
Firm's efforts regarding significant cybersecurity events. In addition, the
Firm has a cybersecurity incident response

Management's discussion and analysis

plan ("IRP") designed to enable the Firm to respond to attempted cybersecurity
incidents, coordinate such responses with law enforcement and other government
agencies, and notify clients and customers, as applicable. Among other key
focus areas, the IRP is designed to mitigate the risk of insider trading
connected to a cybersecurity incident, and includes various escalation points.

The Global Cybersecurity and Technology Controls organization, working with
each of the Firm's LOBs and Corporate, is responsible for identifying
technology and cybersecurity risks and is responsible for the controls to
manage threats. The organization consists of business aligned information
security personnel that are supported within the organization by the following
products and services that execute the Information Security Program for the
Firm:

•Cyber Operations

•Identity & Access Management

•Governance, Risk & Controls

•Global Technology Product Security

The Global Cybersecurity and Technology Controls governance structure is
designed to identify, escalate, and mitigate information security risks. This
structure uses key governance forums to disseminate information and monitor
technology efforts. These forums are established at multiple levels throughout
the Firm. The forums are used to escalate information security risks or other
matters as appropriate.

The IRM function provides oversight of the activities designed to identify,
assess, measure, and mitigate cybersecurity risk.

The Firm's Security Awareness Program includes training that reinforces the
Firm's Information Technology Risk and Security Management policies, standards
and practices, as well as the expectation that employees comply with these
policies. The Security Awareness Program engages personnel through training on
how to identify potential cybersecurity risks and protect the Firm's resources
and information. This training is mandatory for all employees globally on a
periodic basis, and it is supplemented by Firmwide testing initiatives,
including periodic phishing tests. The Firm provides specialized security
training for certain employee roles such as application developers. Finally,
the Firm's Global Privacy Program requires all employees to take periodic
awareness training on data privacy. This privacy-focused training includes
information about confidentiality and security, as well as responding to
unauthorized access to or use of information.

Business and technology resiliency risk

Disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm's control such as the
spread of infectious diseases or pandemics, severe weather, power or
telecommunications loss, failure of a third party to provide expected
services, cyberattacks and terrorism. The Firmwide Business Resiliency Program
is designed to enable the Firm to prepare for, adapt to, withstand and recover
from business disruptions including occurrence of an extraordinary event
beyond its control that may impact critical business functions and supporting
assets (i.e., staff, technology, facilities and third parties). The program
includes governance, awareness training, planning and testing of recovery
strategies, as well as strategic and tactical initiatives to identify, assess,
and manage business interruption and public safety risks.

Payment fraud risk

Payment fraud risk is the risk of external and internal parties unlawfully
obtaining personal monetary benefit through misdirected or otherwise improper
payment. The Firm employs various controls for managing payment fraud risk as
well as providing employee and client education and awareness trainings.

Third-party outsourcing risk

The Firm's Third-Party Oversight ("TPO") and Inter-affiliates Oversight
("IAO") frameworks assist the LOBs and Corporate in selecting, documenting,
onboarding, monitoring and managing their supplier relationships including
services provided by affiliates. The objectives of the TPO framework are to
hold suppliers and other third parties to a high level of operational
performance and to mitigate key risks, including data loss and business
disruptions. The Corporate Third-Party Oversight group is responsible for
Firmwide training, monitoring, reporting and standards.

Insurance

One of the ways in which operational risk may be mitigated is through
insurance maintained by the Firm. The Firm purchases insurance from commercial
insurers and maintains a wholly-owned captive insurer, Park Assurance Company.
Insurance may also be required by third parties with whom the Firm does
business.

COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT  
  
Compliance risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk of failing to
comply with laws, rules, regulations or codes of conduct and standards of
self-regulatory organizations.

Overview

Each of the LOBs and Corporate hold primary ownership of and accountability
for managing their compliance risk. The Firm's Operational Risk and Compliance
Organization ("Operational Risk and Compliance"), which is independent of the
LOBs and Corporate, provides independent review, monitoring and oversight of
business operations with a focus on compliance with the laws, rules, and
regulations applicable to the delivery of the Firm's products and services to
clients and customers.

These compliance risks relate to a wide variety of laws, rules and regulations
varying across the LOBs and Corporate, and jurisdictions, and include risks
related to financial products and services, relationships and interactions
with clients and customers, and employee activities. For example, compliance
risks include those associated with anti-money laundering compliance, trading
activities, market conduct, and complying with the laws, rules, and
regulations related to the offering of products and services across
jurisdictional borders. Compliance risk is also inherent in the Firm's
fiduciary activities, including the failure to exercise the applicable
standard of care to act in the best interest of fiduciary clients and
customers or to treat fiduciary clients and customers fairly.

Other functions provide oversight of significant regulatory obligations that
are specific to their respective areas of responsibility.

Operational Risk and Compliance implements policies and standards designed to
govern, identify, measure, monitor and test, manage, and report on compliance
risk.

Governance and oversight

Operational Risk and Compliance is led by the Firm's Global CCO and FRE for
Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite.

The Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its compliance risk through
the implementation of the CCOR Management Framework. The Firm's Global CCO and
FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite also provides regular
updates to the Board Risk Committee and the Audit Committee on significant
compliance risk issues, as appropriate.

Code of Conduct

The Firm has a Code of Conduct (the "Code") that sets forth the Firm's
expectation that employees will conduct themselves with integrity at all times
and provides the principles that govern employee conduct with clients,
customers, shareholders and one another, as well as with the markets and
communities in which the Firm does business. The Code requires employees to
promptly report any potential or actual violation of the Code, any Firm
policy, or any law or regulation applicable to the Firm's business. It also
requires employees to report any illegal conduct, or conduct that violates the
underlying principles of the Code, by any of the Firm's employees, clients,
customers, suppliers, contract workers, business partners, or agents. Training
is assigned to newly hired employees upon joining the Firm, and to current
employees periodically on an ongoing basis. Employees are required to affirm
their compliance with the Code annually.

Employees can report any potential or actual violations of the Code through
the Firm's Conduct Hotline by phone or the internet. The Hotline is anonymous,
except in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions where laws prohibit anonymous
reporting, and is available at all times globally, with translation services.
It is administered by an outside service provider. The Code prohibits
retaliation against anyone who raises an issue or concern in good faith.
Periodically, the Audit Committee receives reports on the Code of Conduct
program.

CONDUCT RISK MANAGEMENT  
  
Conduct risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk that any action
or misconduct by an employee could lead to unfair client or customer outcomes,
impact the integrity of the markets in which the Firm operates, harm employees
or the Firm, or compromise the Firm's reputation.

Overview

Each LOB and Corporate is accountable for identifying and managing its conduct
risk to provide appropriate engagement, ownership and sustainability of a
culture consistent with the Firm's How We Do Business Principles (the
"Principles"). The Principles serve as a guide for how employees are expected
to conduct themselves. With the Principles serving as a guide, the Firm's Code
sets out the Firm's expectations for each employee and provides information
and resources to help employees conduct business ethically and in compliance
with applicable laws, rules and regulations everywhere the Firm operates.
Refer to Compliance Risk Management on page 145 for further discussion of the
Code.

Governance and oversight

The Conduct Risk Program is governed by the CCOR Management policy, which
establishes the framework for governance, identification, measurement,
monitoring and testing, management and reporting conduct risk in the Firm.

The Firm has a senior forum that provides oversight of the Firm's conduct
initiatives to develop a more holistic view of conduct risks and to connect
key programs across the Firm in order to identify opportunities and emerging
areas of focus. This forum is responsible for setting overall program
direction for strategic enhancements to the Firm's employee conduct framework
and reviewing the consolidated Firmwide Conduct Risk Appetite Assessment.

Conduct risk management encompasses various aspects of people management
practices throughout the employee life cycle, including recruiting,
onboarding, training and development, performance management, promotion and
compensation processes. Each LOB, Treasury and CIO, and each designated
corporate function completes an assessment of conduct risk periodically,
reviews metrics and issues which may involve conduct risk, and provides
conduct education as appropriate.

LEGAL RISK MANAGEMENT  
  
Legal risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk of loss primarily
caused by the actual or alleged failure to meet legal obligations that arise
from the rule of law in jurisdictions in which the Firm operates, agreements
with clients and customers, and products and services offered by the Firm.

Overview

The global Legal function ("Legal") provides legal services and advice to the
Firm. Legal is responsible for managing the Firm's exposure to legal risk by:

•managing actual and potential litigation and enforcement matters, including
internal reviews and investigations related to such matters

•advising on products and services, including contract negotiation and
documentation

•advising on offering and marketing documents and new business initiatives

•managing dispute resolution

•interpreting existing laws, rules and regulations, and advising on changes to
them

•advising on advocacy in connection with contemplated and proposed laws, rules
and regulations, and

•providing legal advice to the LOBs, Corporate and the Board.

Legal selects, engages and manages outside counsel for the Firm on all matters
in which outside counsel is engaged. In addition, Legal advises the Firm's
Conflicts Office which reviews the Firm's wholesale transactions that may have
the potential to create conflicts of interest for the Firm.

Governance and oversight

The Firm's General Counsel reports to the CEO and is a member of the Operating
Committee, the Firmwide Risk Committee and the Firmwide Control Committee. The
Firm's General Counsel and other members of Legal report on significant legal
matters to the Firm's Board of Directors and to the Audit Committee.

Legal serves on and advises various committees and advises the Firm's LOBs and
Corporate on potential reputation risk issues.

ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT  
  
Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the
potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or
misused estimation outputs.

The Firm uses models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations
across various businesses and functions. The estimation methods are of varying
levels of sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the valuation
of positions and measurement of risk, assessing regulatory capital
requirements, conducting stress testing, evaluating the allowance for credit
losses and making business decisions. A dedicated independent function, Model
Risk Governance and Review ("MRGR"), defines and governs the Firm's policies
relating to the management of model risk and risks associated with certain
analytical and judgment-based estimations, such as those used in risk
management, budget forecasting and capital planning and analysis.

The governance of analytical and judgment-based estimations within MRGR's
scope follows a consistent approach which is used for models, as described in
detail below.

Model risks are owned by the users of the models within the Firm based on the
specific purposes of such models. Users and developers of models are
responsible for developing, implementing and testing their models, as well as
referring models to MRGR for review and approval. Once models have been
approved, model users and developers are responsible for maintaining a robust
operating environment, and must monitor and evaluate the performance of the
models on an ongoing basis. Model users and developers may seek to enhance
models in response to changes in the portfolios and in product and market
developments, as well as to capture improvements in available modeling
techniques and systems capabilities.

Models are tiered based on an internal standard according to their complexity,
the exposure associated with the model and the Firm's reliance on the model.
This tiering is subject to the approval of MRGR. In its review of a model,
MRGR considers whether the model is suitable for the specific purposes for
which it will be used. When reviewing a model, MRGR analyzes and challenges
the model methodology and the reasonableness of model assumptions, and may
perform or require additional testing, including back-testing of model
outcomes. Model reviews are approved by the appropriate level of management
within MRGR based on the relevant model tier.

Under the Firm's Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy, MRGR reviews
and approves new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior
to their use. In certain circumstances, exceptions may be granted to the
Firm's policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. MRGR
may also require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model
risk if it is to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the
model and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity.

While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of imprecision or
uncertainty can be heightened by the market or economic environment. This is
particularly true when the current and forecasted environments are
significantly different from the historical environments upon which the models
were developed, as the Firm experienced during the early stages of the
COVID-19 pandemic. This increased uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree
of judgment and analytics to inform any adjustments that the Firm may make to
model outputs than would otherwise be the case.

Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 149-152 and
Note 2 for a summary of model-based valuations and other valuation techniques.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM  
  
JPMorgan Chase's accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to
understanding its reported results. The Firm's most complex accounting
estimates require management's judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying
value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established policies and control
procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments
made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and
applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments
made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and
the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the
Firm's businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are
intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an
appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the
carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is
a brief description of the Firm's critical accounting estimates involving
significant judgments.

Allowance for credit losses

The Firm's allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of
expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's
financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses comprises:

•The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm's retained loan
portfolios (scored and risk-rated),

•The allowance for lending-related commitments, and

•The allowance for credit losses on investment securities.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of
matters including development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts,
incorporation of historical loss experience, assessment of risk
characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of collateral, and the
determination of remaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for
further information on these judgments as well as the Firm's policies and
methodologies used to determine the Firm's allowance for credit losses.

One of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the Firm's
allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to
estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast period within the
Firm's methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of
macroeconomic variables ("MEVs") that are relevant for exposures across the
Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a subset of less
than twenty variables. The specific variables that have the greatest effect on
the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography.

•Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional U.S. unemployment rates,
HPI and U.S. real GDP.

•Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real GDP, U.S.
unemployment, U.S. equity prices, U.S. interest rates, corporate credit
spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices and HPI.

Changes in the Firm's assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could
significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio
at the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from
one reporting period to the next.

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input
might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management
considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for
credit losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at
the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product
types, and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent,
such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in
others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic forecast, the
Firm compared the modeled credit losses determined using its central and
relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five scenarios
considered in estimating the allowances for loan losses and lending-related
commitments. The central and relative adverse scenarios each included a full
suite of MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of those
variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.

For example, compared to the Firm's central scenario shown on page 127 and in
Note 13, the Firm's relative adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S.
unemployment rate, averaging approximately 1.9% higher over the eight-quarter
forecast, with a peak difference of approximately 2.8% in the fourth quarter
of 2023; lower U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining nearly 3.1%
lower at the end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of
approximately 3.9% in the fourth quarter of 2023; and lower national HPI with
a peak difference of approximately 8.4% in the third quarter of 2024.

This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes in the
allowance for credit losses, for a number of reasons, including:

•The allowance as of December 31, 2022, reflects credit losses beyond those
estimated under the central scenario due to the weight placed on the adverse
scenarios.

•The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both interrelated and nonlinear, so
the results of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe
changes in macroeconomic variables.

•Expectations of future changes in portfolio composition and borrower behavior
can significantly affect the allowance for credit losses.

To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to macroeconomic
forecasts as of December 31, 2022, the

Management's discussion and analysis

Firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse scenario to its
central scenario. Without considering offsetting or correlated effects in
other qualitative components of the Firm's allowance for credit losses, the
comparison between these two scenarios for the exposures below reflect the
following differences:

•An increase of approximately $500 million for residential real estate loans
and lending-related commitments

•An increase of approximately $2.2 billion for credit card loans

•An increase of approximately $3.9 billion for wholesale loans and lending-
related commitments

This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not
intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as it
does not reflect any potential changes in other adjustments to the
quantitative calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment
management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the
uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on
then-current circumstances and conditions.

Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently
uncertain, particularly in light of the recent economic conditions, the Firm
believes that its process to consider the available information and associated
risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its estimates of
expected credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended
December 31, 2022.

  

Fair value

JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value.
The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a
recurring basis, including derivatives, structured note products and certain
securities financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are measured
at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home equity
and other loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the
underlying collateral.

Assets measured at fair value

The following table includes the Firm's assets measured at fair value and the
portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the fair value
hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for further information.

Valuation

Details of the Firm's processes for determining fair value are set out in Note
2. Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and
level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable
market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using
internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use
significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of
the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more
significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments
classified within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3,
management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other
valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain
significant inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical data in
deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield
curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities,
correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of
comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to
Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments,
including unobservable inputs used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be
applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect
counterparty credit quality, the Firm's creditworthiness, market funding
rates, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios
that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The
judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific
contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the
market as a whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and uncertainty
judgments are further affected by the wider variation of reasonable valuation
estimates, particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2
for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can
affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position.
Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and
consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and
assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm's
businesses and portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of
fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used
by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the
reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm's
valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for
individual financial instruments.

Goodwill impairment

Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and tested for
impairment at least annually. The Firm's process and methodology used to
conduct goodwill impairment testing is described in Note 15.

Management applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment.
The goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the
related reporting units for goodwill impairment testing.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Firm reviewed current economic
conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as actual business
results and projections of business performance. Based on such reviews, the
Firm has concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2022. For
each of the reporting units, fair value exceeded carrying value by at least
10% and there was no indication of a significant risk of goodwill impairment
based on current projections and valuations.

The projections for the Firm's reporting units are consistent with
management's current business outlook assumptions in the short term, and the
Firm's best estimates of long-term growth and return on equity in the longer
term. Where possible, the Firm uses third-party and peer data to benchmark its
assumptions and estimates.

Refer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, including the
goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2022.

Credit card rewards liability

JPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various rewards programs which allow
cardholders to earn rewards points based on their account activity and the
terms and conditions of the rewards program. Generally, there are no limits on
the points that an eligible cardholder can earn, nor do the points expire, and
the points can be redeemed for a variety of rewards, including cash
(predominantly in the form of account credits), gift cards and travel. The
Firm maintains a rewards liability which represents the estimated cost of
rewards points earned and expected to be redeemed by cardholders. The
liability is accrued as the cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when
the cardholder redeems points. This liability was $11.3 billion and $9.8
billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is recorded in
accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The
increase in the liability was driven by continued growth in rewards points
earned on increased cardholder spending and promotional offers outpacing
redemptions throughout 2022.

The rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate ("RR") and cost per
point ("CPP") assumptions. The RR assumption is used to estimate the number of
points earned by customers that will be redeemed over the life of the account.
The CPP assumption is used to estimate the cost of future point redemptions.
These assumptions are evaluated periodically considering historical actuals,
cardholder redemption behavior and management judgment. Updates

Management's discussion and analysis

to these assumptions will impact the rewards liability. As of December 31,
2022, a combined increase of 25 basis points in RR and 1 basis point in CPP
would increase the rewards liability by approximately $315 million.

Income taxes

JPMorgan Chase is subject to the income tax laws of the various jurisdictions
in which it operates, including U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S.
jurisdictions. These laws are often complex and may be subject to different
interpretations. To determine the financial statement impact of accounting for
income taxes, including the provision for income tax expense and unrecognized
tax benefits, JPMorgan Chase must make assumptions and judgments about how to
interpret and apply these complex tax laws to numerous transactions and
business events, as well as make judgments regarding the timing of when
certain items may affect taxable income in the U.S. and non-U.S. tax
jurisdictions.

JPMorgan Chase's interpretations of tax laws around the world are subject to
review and examination by the various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions
where the Firm operates, and disputes may occur regarding its view on a tax
position. These disputes over interpretations with the various taxing
authorities may be settled by audit, administrative appeals or adjudication in
the court systems of the tax jurisdictions in which the Firm operates.
JPMorgan Chase regularly reviews whether it may be assessed additional income
taxes as a result of the resolution of these matters, and the Firm records
additional unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate. In addition, the Firm
may revise its estimate of income taxes due to changes in income tax laws,
legal interpretations, and business strategies. It is possible that revisions
in the Firm's estimate of income taxes may materially affect the Firm's
results of operations in any reporting period.

Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured
for financial reporting versus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets
are recognized if, in management's judgment, their realizability is determined
to be more likely than not. Deferred taxes are measured using enacted tax
rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on
deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized within the provision for
income taxes in the period enacted.

The Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in connection with certain
tax attributes, including net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards and foreign
tax credit ("FTC") carryforwards. The Firm performs regular reviews to
ascertain whether its deferred tax assets are realizable. These reviews
include management's estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable
income, including foreign source income, and may incorporate various tax
planning strategies, including strategies that may be available to utilize
NOLs and FTCs before they expire. In connection with these reviews, if it is
determined that a deferred tax asset is not realizable, a valuation allowance
is

established. The valuation allowance may be reversed in a subsequent reporting
period if the Firm determines that, based on revised estimates of future
taxable income or changes in tax planning strategies, it is more likely than
not that all or part of the deferred tax asset will become realizable. As of
December 31, 2022, management has determined it is more likely than not that
the Firm will realize its deferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation
allowance.

The Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as necessary when new
information becomes available, including changes in tax law and regulations,
and interactions with taxing authorities. Uncertain tax positions that meet
the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured to determine the
amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the
largest amount of benefit that management believes is more likely than not to
be realized upon settlement. It is possible that the reassessment of JPMorgan
Chase's unrecognized tax benefits may have a material impact on its effective
income tax rate in the period in which the reassessment occurs. Although the
Firm believes that its estimates are reasonable, the final tax amount could be
different from the amounts reflected in the Firm's income tax provisions and
accruals. To the extent that the final outcome of these amounts is different
than the amounts recorded, such differences will generally impact the Firm's
provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is
made.

The Firm's provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred
taxes. The current and deferred tax provisions are calculated based on
estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected
in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on
filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are
filed and the global tax implications are known, which could impact the Firm's
effective tax rate.

Refer to Note 25 for additional information on income taxes.

transactions are amended due to reference rate reform.

•Provides an election to account for certain contract amendments related to
reference rate reform as modifications rather than extinguishments without the
requirement to assess the significance of the amendments.

•Allows for changes in critical terms of a hedge accounting relationship
without automatic termination of that relationship. Provides various practical
expedients and elections designed to allow hedge accounting to continue
uninterrupted during the transition period.

•Provides a one-time election to transfer securities out of the held-to-
maturity classification if certain criteria are met.

•The January 2021 update provides an election to account for derivatives
modified to change the rate used for discounting, margining, or contract price
alignment (collectively "discounting transition") as modifications.

•The December 2022 update extends the termination date of the optional
expedients and exceptions to current accounting guidance to December 31, 2024.

| |

•Issued and effective March 12, 2020. The January 7, 2021 and December 21,
2022 updates were effective when issued.

•The Firm elected to apply certain of the practical expedients related to
contract modifications and hedge accounting relationships, and discounting
transition beginning in the third quarter of 2020. The discounting transition
election was applied retrospectively. The main purpose of the practical
expedients is to ease the administrative burden of accounting for contracts
impacted by reference rate reform. These elections did not have a material
impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Management's report on internal control over financial reporting

  

Management of JPMorgan Chase & Co. ("JPMorgan Chase" or the "Firm") is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed by, or under the supervision of, the Firm's principal executive and
principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and
effected by JPMorgan Chase's Board of Directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").

JPMorgan Chase's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records, that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the Firm's assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of
the Firm are being made only in accordance with authorizations of JPMorgan
Chase's management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the Firm's assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Firm's internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making the assessment,
management used the "Internal Control -- Integrated Framework" ("COSO 2013")
promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission ("COSO").

Based upon the assessment performed, management concluded that as of December
31, 2022, JPMorgan Chase's internal control over financial reporting was
effective based upon the COSO 2013 framework. Additionally, based upon
management's assessment, the Firm determined that there were no material
weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2022.

The effectiveness of the Firm's internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2022, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which
appears herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

![jpm-20221231_g11.jpg](jpm-20221231_g11.jpg)

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.:

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of JPMorgan Chase
& Co. and its subsidiaries (the "Firm") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and
the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes
in stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively
referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited
the Firm's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022,
based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Firm
as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Also in our opinion, the Firm maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

Change in Accounting Principle

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Firm
changed the manner in which it accounts for credit losses on certain financial
instruments in 2020.

Basis for Opinions

The Firm's management is responsible for these consolidated financial
statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's report on
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on the Firm's consolidated financial statements and on the Firm's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the
Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the
current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that
(i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated
financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective,
or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not
alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken
as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below,
providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts
or disclosures to which they relate.

Allowance for Loan Losses - Portfolio-based component of Wholesale Loan and
Credit Card Loan Portfolios

As described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the
allowance for loan losses for the portfolio-based component of the wholesale
and credit card loan portfolios was $17.0 billion on total portfolio-based
retained loans of $785.9 billion at December 31, 2022. The Firm's allowance
for loan losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses
over the remaining expected life of the Firm's loan portfolios and considers
expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. The portfolio-based
component of the Firm's allowance for loan losses for the wholesale and credit
card retained loan portfolios begins with a quantitative calculation of
expected credit losses over the expected life of the loan by applying credit
loss factors to the estimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors
applied are determined based on the weighted average of five internally
developed macroeconomic scenarios that take into consideration the Firm's
economic outlook as derived through forecast macroeconomic variables, the most
significant of which are U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic
product. This quantitative calculation is further adjusted to take into
consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other
subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss
estimate.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures
relating to the allowance for loan losses for the portfolio-based component of
the wholesale and credit card loan portfolios is a critical audit matter are
(i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in the forecast of
macroeconomic variables, specifically U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross
domestic product, as the Firm's forecasts of economic conditions significantly
affect its estimate of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date, (ii)
the significant judgment and estimation by management in determining the
quantitative calculation utilized in their credit loss estimates and the
adjustments to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk
assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise
reflected in the credit loss estimate, which both in turn led to a high degree
of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in

evaluating audit evidence obtained relating to the credit loss estimates and
the appropriateness of the adjustments to the credit loss estimates, and (iii)
the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and
knowledge.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit
evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of
controls relating to the Firm's allowance for loan losses, including controls
over model validation and generation of macroeconomic scenarios. These
procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for
estimating the allowance for loan losses, which involved (i) evaluating the
appropriateness of the models and methodologies used in quantitative
calculations; (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of forecasts of U.S.
unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product; (iii) testing the
completeness and accuracy of data used in the estimate; and (iv) evaluating
the reasonableness of management's adjustments to the quantitative output for
the impacts of model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other
subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss
estimate. These procedures also included the use of professionals with
specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of
certain models, methodologies and macroeconomic variables.

Fair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments

As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Firm carries $1.1 trillion of its assets and $453.7 billion of its liabilities
at fair value on a recurring basis. Included in these balances are $13.6
billion of trading assets and $37.8 billion of liabilities measured at fair
value on a recurring basis, collectively financial instruments, which are
classified as level 3 as they contain one or more inputs to valuation which
are unobservable and significant to their fair value measurement. The Firm
utilized internally developed valuation models and unobservable inputs to
estimate fair value of the level 3 financial instruments. The unobservable
inputs used by management to estimate the fair value of certain of these
financial instruments include volatility relating to interest rates,
correlation relating to interest rates, equity prices, credit and foreign
exchange rates, and Bermudan switch values.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures
relating to the fair value of certain level 3 financial instruments is a
critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by
management in determining the inputs to estimate fair value, which in turn led
to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing
procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the fair value
of these financial instruments, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of
professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit
evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of
controls relating to the Firm's determination of the fair value, including
controls over models, inputs, and data. These procedures also included, among
others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge
to assist in developing an independent estimate of fair value for a sample of
these financial instruments and comparing management's estimate to the
independently developed estimate of fair value. Developing the independent
estimate involved testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by
management, developing independent inputs and, as appropriate, evaluating and

Notes to consolidated financial statements

  

Note 1 - Basis of presentation

JPMorgan Chase & Co. ("JPMorgan Chase" or the "Firm"), a financial holding
company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial
services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a
leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small
businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset
management. Refer to Note 32 for a further discussion of the Firm's business
segments.

The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its
subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the
policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by
regulatory authorities.

Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been revised to conform with
the current presentation.

Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase
and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All
material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not
assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance
sheets.

The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an
entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a
variable interest entity.

Voting interest entities

Voting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity and provide
the equity investors voting rights that enable them to make significant
decisions relating to the entity's operations. For these types of entities,
the Firm's determination of whether it has a controlling interest is primarily
based on the amount of voting equity interests held. Entities in which the
Firm has a controlling financial interest, through ownership of the majority
of the entities' voting equity interests, or through other contractual rights
that give the Firm control, are consolidated by the Firm.

Investments in companies in which the Firm has significant influence over
operating and financing decisions (but does not own a majority of the voting
equity interests) are accounted for (i) in accordance with the equity method
of accounting, or (ii) at fair value if the fair value option was elected.
These investments are generally included in other assets, with income or loss
included in noninterest revenue.

Certain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are structured as limited
partnerships or limited liability companies. For many of these entities, the
Firm is the general partner or managing member, but the non-affiliated
partners or members have the ability to remove the Firm as the general partner
or managing member without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple
majority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or members

have rights to participate in important decisions. Accordingly, the Firm does
not consolidate these voting interest entities. However, in the limited cases
where the non-managing partners or members do not have substantive kick-out or
participating rights, the Firm evaluates the funds as VIEs and consolidates
the funds if the Firm is the general partner or managing member and has both
power and a potentially significant interest.

The Firm's investment companies and asset management funds have investments in
both publicly-held and privately-held entities, including investments in
buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities. These investments are
accounted for under investment company guidelines and, accordingly,
irrespective of the percentage of equity ownership interests held, are carried
on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value, and are recorded in other
assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. If consolidated,
the Firm retains the accounting under such specialized investment company
guidelines.

Variable interest entities

VIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit
the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial
support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the
ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity's operations
through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected
losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the
entity.

The most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly used in
securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute
the cash flows from those assets to investors. The basic SPE structure
involves a company selling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of
those assets by issuing securities to investors. The legal documents that
govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be
allocated to the SPE's investors and other parties that have rights to those
cash flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors from claims on
the SPE's assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditors of
the seller of the assets.

The primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a controlling
financial interest) is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of
the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the power to
direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's
economic performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the obligation
to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could
potentially be significant to the VIE.

To assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the activities of a VIE
that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, the Firm
considers all the facts and circumstances, including its role in establishing
the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment

includes, first, identifying the activities that most significantly impact the
VIE's economic performance; and second, identifying which party, if any, has
power over those activities. In general, the parties that make the most
significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset managers, collateral
managers, servicers, or owners of call options or liquidation rights over the
VIE's assets) or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers
are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE.

To assess whether the Firm has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or
the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be
significant to the VIE, the Firm considers all of its economic interests,
including debt and equity investments, servicing fees, and derivatives or
other arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. This assessment
requires that the Firm apply judgment in determining whether these interests,
in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the VIE. Factors
considered in assessing significance include: the design of the VIE, including
its capitalization structure; subordination of interests; payment priority;
relative share of interests held across various classes within the VIE's
capital structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the Firm.

The Firm performs on-going reassessments of: (1) whether entities previously
evaluated under the majority voting-interest framework have become VIEs, based
on certain events, and are therefore subject to the VIE consolidation
framework; and (2) whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding
the Firm's involvement with a VIE cause the Firm's consolidation conclusion to
change.

Refer to Note 14 for further discussion of the Firm's VIEs.

Revenue recognition

Interest income

The Firm recognizes interest income on loans, debt securities, and other debt
instruments, generally on a level-yield basis, based on the underlying
contractual rate. Refer to Note 7 for further information.

Revenue from contracts with customers

JPMorgan Chase recognizes noninterest revenue from certain contracts with
customers, in investment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management
administration and commissions, and components of card income, when the Firm's
related performance obligations are satisfied. Refer to Note 6 for further
discussion of the Firm's revenue from contracts with customers.

Principal transactions revenue

JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value.
Changes in fair value are reported primarily in principal transactions
revenue. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion of fair value
measurement. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of principal transactions
revenue.

Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated financial statements

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, revenue and expense, and disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates.

Foreign currency translation

JPMorgan Chase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and expense denominated
in non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates.

Gains and losses relating to translating functional currency financial
statements for U.S. reporting are included in the Consolidated statements of
comprehensive income. Gains and losses relating to nonfunctional currency
transactions, including non-U.S. operations where the functional currency is
the U.S. dollar, are reported in the Consolidated statements of income.

Offsetting assets and liabilities

U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative
payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral
receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets
when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also
permits securities sold and purchased under repurchase agreements and
securities borrowed or loaned under securities loan agreements to be presented
net when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally
enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such
balances where it has determined that the specified conditions are met.

The Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk
in certain transactions, including derivative contracts, resale, repurchase,
securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements. A master netting
agreement is a single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple
transactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and
settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a
default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities
transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due). Upon the exercise of
derivatives termination rights by the non-defaulting party (i) all
transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are valued and the positive
values of "in the money" transactions are netted against the negative values
of "out of the money" transactions and (iii) the only remaining payment
obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount. Upon
exercise of default rights under repurchase agreements and securities loan
agreements in general (i) all transactions are terminated and accelerated,
(ii) all values of securities or cash held or to be delivered are calculated,
and all such sums are netted against each other and (iii) the only remaining
payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination
amount.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Typical master netting agreements for these types of transactions also often
contain a collateral/margin agreement that provides for a security interest
in, or title transfer of, securities or cash collateral/margin to the party
that has the right to demand margin (the "demanding party"). The
collateral/margin agreement typically requires a party to transfer
collateral/margin to the demanding party with a value equal to the amount of
the margin deficit on a net basis across all transactions governed by the
master netting agreement, less any threshold. The collateral/margin agreement
grants to the demanding party, upon default by the counterparty, the right to
set-off any amounts payable by the counterparty against any posted collateral
or the cash equivalent of any posted collateral/margin. It also grants to the
demanding party the right to liquidate collateral/margin and to apply the
proceeds to an amount payable by the counterparty.

Refer to Note 5 for further discussion of the Firm's derivative instruments.
Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of the Firm's securities financing
agreements.

Statements of cash flows

For JPMorgan Chase's Consolidated statements of cash flows, cash is defined as
those amounts included in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks on
the Consolidated balance sheets.

Accounting standard adopted January 1, 2023

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings ("TDRs")

The adoption of this guidance eliminates the accounting and disclosure
requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the allowance
using a discounted cash flow ("DCF") methodology, and allows the option of a
non-DCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers. If
a DCF methodology is still applied for these modified loans, the discount rate
must be the post-modification effective interest rate, instead of the pre-
modification effective interest rate.

The Firm elected to apply its non-DCF, portfolio-based allowance approach for
modified loans to troubled borrowers for all portfolios except modified
nonaccrual risk-rated loans which the Firm elected to continue applying a DCF
methodology. See Note 13 for a description of the portfolio-based allowance
approach and the asset-specific allowance approach.

This guidance was adopted on January 1, 2023 under the modified retrospective
method which resulted in a net decrease to the allowance for credit losses of
approximately $600 million and an increase to retained earnings of
approximately $450 million, after-tax predominantly driven by residential real
estate and credit card.

  

Accounting standard adopted January 1, 2020

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses ("CECL")

The adoption of this guidance established a single allowance framework for all
financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet
credit exposures. This framework requires that management's estimate reflects
credit losses over the instrument's remaining expected life and considers
expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. Prior to the adoption of
the CECL accounting guidance, the Firm's allowance for credit losses
represented management's estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the
Firm's retained loan portfolios and certain lending-related commitments.

Note 2 - Fair value measurement

JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value.
These assets and liabilities are predominantly carried at fair value on a
recurring basis (i.e., assets and liabilities that are measured and reported
at fair value on the Firm's Consolidated balance sheets). Certain assets,
liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are measured at fair
value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at fair value on
an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain
circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment).

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based on quoted market
prices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes are not available, fair
value is based on valuation models and other valuation techniques that
consider relevant transaction characteristics (such as maturity) and use, as
inputs, observable or unobservable market parameters, including yield curves,
interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt
prices), correlations, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Valuation
adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at
fair value, as described below.

The level of precision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other
factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular
position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are
appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the
methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across
the Firm's businesses and portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of
fair value. The use of different methodologies or assumptions by other market
participants compared with those used by the Firm could result in the Firm
deriving a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.

Valuation process

Risk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair value estimates for
assets and liabilities carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair
value. The Firm's Valuation Control Group ("VCG"), which is part of the Firm's
Finance function and independent of the risk-taking functions, is responsible
for verifying these estimates and determining any fair value adjustments that
may be required to ensure that the Firm's positions are recorded at fair
value. In addition, the Firm's Valuation Governance Forum ("VGF"), which is
composed of senior finance and risk executives, is responsible for overseeing
the management of risks arising from valuation activities conducted across the
Firm. The Firmwide VGF is chaired by the Firmwide head of the VCG (under the
direction of the Firm's Controller), and includes sub-forums covering the

CIB, CCB, CB, AWM and certain corporate functions including Treasury and CIO.

Price verification process

The VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the risk-taking functions by
leveraging independently derived prices, valuation inputs and other market
data, where available. Where independent prices or inputs are not available,
the VCG performs additional review to ensure the reasonableness of the
estimates. The additional review may include evaluating the limited market
activity including client unwinds, benchmarking valuation inputs to those used
for similar instruments, decomposing the valuation of structured instruments
into individual components, comparing expected to actual cash flows, reviewing
profit and loss trends, and reviewing trends in collateral valuation. There
are also additional levels of management review for more significant or
complex positions.

The VCG determines any valuation adjustments that may be required to the
estimates provided by the risk-taking functions. No adjustments to quoted
prices are applied for instruments classified within level 1 of the fair value
hierarchy (refer to the discussion below for further information on the fair
value hierarchy). For other positions, judgment is required to assess the need
for valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect liquidity considerations,
unobservable parameters, and, for certain portfolios that meet specified
criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The determination of such
adjustments follows a consistent framework across the Firm:

•Liquidity valuation adjustments are considered where an observable external
price or valuation parameter exists but is of lower reliability, potentially
due to lower market activity. Liquidity valuation adjustments are made based
on current market conditions. Factors that may be considered in determining
the liquidity adjustment include analysis of: (1) the estimated bid-offer
spread for the instrument being traded; (2) alternative pricing points for
similar instruments in active markets; and (3) the range of reasonable values
that the price or parameter could take.

•The Firm manages certain portfolios of financial instruments on the basis of
net open risk exposure and, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to estimate
the fair value of such portfolios on the basis of a transfer of the entire net
open risk position in an orderly transaction. Where this is the case,
valuation adjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of exiting a
larger-than-normal market-size net open risk position. Where applied, such
adjustments are based on factors that a relevant market participant would
consider in the transfer of the net open risk position, including the size of
the adverse market move that is likely to occur during the period required to
reduce the net open risk position to a normal market-size.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

•Uncertainty adjustments related to unobservable parameters may be made when
positions are valued using prices or input parameters to valuation models that
are unobservable due to a lack of market activity or because they cannot be
implied from observable market data. Such prices or parameters must be
estimated and are, therefore, subject to management judgment. Adjustments are
made to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the resulting valuation estimate.

•Where appropriate, the Firm also applies adjustments to its estimates of fair
value in order to appropriately reflect counterparty credit quality (CVA), the
Firm's own creditworthiness (DVA) and the impact of funding (FVA), using a
consistent framework across the Firm. Refer to Credit and funding adjustments
on page 184 of this Note for more information on such adjustments.

Valuation model review and approval

If prices or quotes are not available for an instrument or a similar
instrument, fair value is generally determined using valuation models that
consider relevant transaction terms such as maturity and use as inputs market-
based or independently sourced parameters. Where this is the case the price
verification process described above is applied to the inputs in those models.

Under the Firm's Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy, MRGR reviews
and approves new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior
to implementation in the operating environment. In certain circumstances
exceptions may be granted to the Firm's policy to allow a model to be used
prior to review or approval. MRGR may also require the user to take
appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the
interim. These actions will depend on the model and may include, for example,
limitation of trading activity.

Fair value hierarchy

A three-level fair value hierarchy has been established under U.S. GAAP for
disclosure of fair value measurements. The fair value hierarchy is based on
the observability of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of
the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows.

•Level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted)
for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

•Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for
similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for
substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

•Level 3 - one or more inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable
and significant to the fair value measurement.

A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is
based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
measurement.

(a)At December 31, 2022 and 2021, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $73.8
billion and $73.9 billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related.

(b)Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower
of cost or net realizable value. "Net realizable value" is a term defined in
U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell ("transaction
costs"). Transaction costs for the Firm's physical commodities inventories are
either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore,
net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm's physical
commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net
realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities
approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost
basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further
discussion of the Firm's hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent
fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have
been included in each period presented.

(c)Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the
amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).

Notes to consolidated financial statements

(d)Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset
value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required
to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2022 and 2021,
the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds,
private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $950 million and $801
million, respectively. Included in these balances at December 31, 2022 and
2021, were trading assets of $43 million and $51 million, respectively, and
other assets of $907 million and $750 million, respectively.

(e)At December 31, 2022 and 2021, included $9.7 billion and $26.2 billion,
respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $6.8 billion and $8.2
billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential
mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to
sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $2.4 billion and $13.6 billion,
respectively.

(f)As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative
receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received
and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level
3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting
benefit associated with cash collateral.

Level 3 valuations

The Firm has established well-structured processes for determining fair value,
including for instruments where fair value is estimated using significant
unobservable inputs (level 3). Refer to pages 167-171 of this Note for further
information on the Firm's valuation process and a detailed discussion of the
determination of fair value for individual financial instruments.

Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level
of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market
information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally
developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant
unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair
value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant
than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified
within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3,
management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other
valuation technique to use. Second, due to the lack of observability of
significant inputs, management must assess relevant empirical data in deriving
valuation inputs including transaction details, yield curves, interest rates,
prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as
commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments,
foreign exchange rates and credit curves.

The following table presents the Firm's primary level 3 financial instruments,
the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial
instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for
those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the
determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the
significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement,
level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that
is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external
sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level
2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk
of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities
and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair
value hierarchy.

The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest
and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments
within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted
averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on
the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value.

In the Firm's view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do
not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the
reasonableness of the Firm's estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect
the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the
relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For
example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure
and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied
volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings,
tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values will
therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the
characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet
date.

product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated
balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique
in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued
using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.

(b)Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $752 million,
nonagency securities of $5 million and non-trading loans of $892 million.

(c)Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $7 million,
nonagency securities of $7 million, trading loans of $40 million and non-
trading loans of $369 million.

(d)Comprises trading loans of $719 million and non-trading loans of $157
million.

(e)Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes
issued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain
embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes
includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The
significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented
for derivative receivables.

(f)Includes equity securities of $880 million including $216 million in Other
assets, for which quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value
is generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples
and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are
insignificant both individually and in aggregate.

(g)Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When
quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed
on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed
assuming a par value of $100.

(h)Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs

The following discussion provides a description of the impact on a fair value
measurement of a change in each unobservable input in isolation, and the
interrelationship between unobservable inputs, where relevant and significant.
The impact of changes in inputs may not be independent, as a change in one
unobservable input may give rise to a change in another unobservable input.
Where relationships do exist between two unobservable inputs, those
relationships are discussed below. Relationships may also exist between
observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as observable interest rates
rise, unobservable prepayment rates decline); such relationships have not been
included in the discussion below. In addition, for each of the individual
relationships described below, the inverse relationship would also generally
apply.

The following discussion also provides a description of attributes of the
underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of
inputs used in the valuation of the Firm's positions.

Yield - The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to discount future
cash flows in a discounted cash flow calculation. An increase in the yield, in
isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.

Credit spread - The credit spread is the amount of additional annualized
return over the market interest rate that a market participant would demand
for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. The credit spread for
an instrument forms part of the discount rate used in a discounted cash flow
calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would result in a
decrease in a fair value measurement.

The yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgage-backed security
primarily reflect the risk inherent in the instrument. The yield is also
impacted by the absolute level of the coupon paid by the instrument (which may
not correspond directly to the level of inherent risk). Therefore, the range
of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk inherent in various
instruments owned by the Firm. The risk inherent in mortgage-backed securities
is driven by the subordination of the security being valued and the
characteristics of the underlying mortgages within the collateralized pool,
including borrower FICO scores, LTV ratios for residential mortgages and the
nature of the property and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For
corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and
other similar instruments, credit spreads reflect the credit quality of the
obligor and the tenor of the obligation.

Prepayment speed - The prepayment speed is a measure of the voluntary
unscheduled principal repayments of a prepayable obligation in a
collateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally decline as borrower
delinquencies rise. An increase in prepayment speeds, in isolation, would
result in a decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a premium
to par and an increase in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a
discount to par.

Prepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to collateral pool, and are
driven by the type and location of the underlying borrower, and the remaining
tenor of the obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or
floating) of interest rate being paid by the borrower. Typically collateral
pools with higher borrower credit quality have a higher prepayment rate than
those with lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being equal.

Conditional default rate - The conditional default rate is a measure of the
reduction in the outstanding collateral balance underlying a collateralized
obligation as a result of defaults. While there is typically no direct
relationship between conditional default rates and prepayment speeds,
collateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral has high
prepayment speeds will tend to have lower conditional default rates. An
increase in conditional default rates would generally be accompanied by an
increase in loss severity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in
the conditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a
fair value measurement. Conditional default rates reflect the quality of the
collateral underlying a securitization and the structure of the securitization
itself. Based on the types of securities owned in the Firm's market-making
portfolios, conditional default rates are most typically at the lower end of
the range presented.

Loss severity - The loss severity (the inverse concept is the recovery rate)
is the expected amount of future realized losses resulting from the ultimate
liquidation of a particular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative
to the outstanding loan balance. An increase in loss severity is generally
accompanied by an increase in conditional default rates. An increase in the
loss severity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value
measurement.

The loss severity applied in valuing a mortgage-backed security investment
depends on factors relating to the underlying mortgages, including the LTV
ratio, the nature of the lender's lien on the property and other instrument-
specific factors.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Correlation - Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the
movements of two variables. Correlation is a pricing input for a derivative
product where the payoff is driven by one or more underlying risks.
Correlation inputs are related to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate,
credit, equity, foreign exchange and commodity) due to the nature of the
underlying risks. When parameters are positively correlated, an increase in
one parameter will result in an increase in the other parameter. When
parameters are negatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result
in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in correlation can result in
an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. Given a short
correlation position, an increase in correlation, in isolation, would
generally result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.

The level of correlation used in the valuation of derivatives with multiple
underlying risks depends on a number of factors including the nature of those
risks. For example, the correlation between two credit risk exposures would be
different than that between two interest rate risk exposures. Similarly, the
tenor of the transaction may also impact the correlation input, as the
relationship between the underlying risks may be different over different time
periods. Furthermore, correlation levels are very much dependent on market
conditions and could have a relatively wide range of levels within or across
asset classes over time, particularly in volatile market conditions.

Volatility - Volatility is a measure of the variability in possible returns
for an instrument, parameter or market index given how much the particular
instrument, parameter or index changes in value over time. Volatility is a
pricing input for options, including equity options, commodity options, and
interest rate options. Generally, the higher the volatility of the underlying,
the riskier the instrument. Given a long position in an option, an increase in
volatility, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair
value measurement.

The level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option-based
derivative depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the risk
underlying the option (e.g., the volatility of a particular equity security
may be significantly different from that of a particular commodity index), the
tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price of the option.

Bermudan switch value - The switch value is the difference between the overall
value of a Bermudan swaption, which can be exercised at multiple points in
time, and its most expensive European swaption and reflects the additional
value that the multiple exercise dates provide the holder. Switch values are
dependent on market conditions and can vary greatly depending on a number of
factors, such as the tenor of the underlying swap as well as the strike price
of the option. An increase in switch value, in isolation, would generally
result in an increase in a fair value measurement.

Interest rate curve - represents the relationship of interest rates over
differing tenors. The interest rate curve is used to set interest rate and
foreign exchange derivative cash flows and is also a pricing input used in the
discounting of any derivative cash flow.

Forward price - Forward price is the price at which the buyer agrees to
purchase the asset underlying a forward contract on the predetermined future
delivery date, and is such that the value of the contract is zero at
inception.

The forward price is used as an input in the valuation of certain derivatives
and depends on a number of factors including interest rates, the current price
of the underlying asset, and the expected income to be received and costs to
be incurred by the seller as a result of holding that asset until the delivery
date. An increase in the forward can result in an increase or a decrease in a
fair value measurement.

Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements

The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets
amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified
by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the years ended
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. When a determination is made to classify a
financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the
significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement.
However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the
unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components
that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources);
accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair
value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation
methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3
financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are
classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1
and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or
losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm's risk
management activities related to such level 3 instruments.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Credit and funding adjustments - derivatives

Derivatives are generally valued using models that use as their basis
observable market parameters. These market parameters generally do not
consider factors such as counterparty nonperformance risk, the Firm's own
credit quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it is generally necessary to
make adjustments to the base estimate of fair value to reflect these factors.

CVA represents the adjustment, relative to the relevant benchmark interest
rate, necessary to reflect counterparty nonperformance risk. The Firm
estimates CVA using a scenario analysis to estimate the expected positive
credit exposure across all of the Firm's existing positions with each
counterparty, and then estimates losses based on the probability of default
and estimated recovery rate as a result of a counterparty credit event
considering contractual factors designed to mitigate the Firm's credit
exposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset. The key inputs to
this methodology are (i) the probability of a default event occurring for each
counterparty, as derived from observed or estimated CDS spreads; and (ii)
estimated recovery rates implied by CDS spreads, adjusted to consider the
differences in recovery rates as a derivative creditor relative to those
reflected in CDS spreads, which generally reflect senior unsecured creditor
risk.

FVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of funding and is
recognized where there is evidence that a market participant in the principal
market would incorporate it in a transfer of the instrument. The Firm's FVA
framework, applied to uncollateralized (including partially collateralized)
over-the-counter ("OTC") derivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) the
expected funding requirements arising from the Firm's positions with

each counterparty and collateral arrangements; and (ii) the estimated market
funding cost in the principal market which, for derivative liabilities,
considers the Firm's credit risk (DVA). For collateralized derivatives, the
fair value is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at the
relevant overnight indexed swap rate given the underlying collateral agreement
with the counterparty, and therefore a separate FVA is not necessary.

The following table provides the impact of credit and funding adjustments on
principal transactions revenue in the respective periods, excluding the effect
of any associated hedging activities. The FVA presented below includes the
impact of the Firm's own credit quality on the inception value of liabilities
as well as the impact of changes in the Firm's own credit quality over time.

Valuation adjustments on fair value option elected liabilities

The valuation of the Firm's liabilities for which the fair value option has
been elected requires consideration of the Firm's own credit risk. DVA on fair
value option elected liabilities reflects changes (subsequent to the issuance
of the liability) in the Firm's probability of default and LGD, which are
estimated based on changes in the Firm's credit spread observed in the bond
market. Realized (gains)/losses due to DVA for fair value option elected
liabilities are reported in principal transactions revenue. Unrealized
(gains)/losses are reported in OCI. Refer to page 182 in this Note and Note 24
for further information.

(a) Primarily includes equity securities without readily determinable fair
values that were adjusted based on observable price changes in orderly
transactions from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer
(measurement alternative). Of the $1.4 billion in level 3 assets measured at
fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2022, $1.2 billion
related to equity securities adjusted based on the measurement alternative.
These equity securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of
the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares.

(b) Of the $627 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2022, $83 million related to residential
real estate loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying
collateral (e.g., collateral-dependent loans). These amounts are classified as
level 3 as they are valued using information from broker's price opinions,
appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the Firm's
experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 9% to
56% with a weighted average of 23%.

Nonrecurring fair value changes

The following table presents the total change in value of assets and

The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair
values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price
changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (i.e.,
measurement alternative), with such changes recognized in other income.

In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes,
the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm's
estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the
different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments
that are consistent with the Firm's valuation techniques for private equity
direct investments.

The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without
readily determinable fair values held as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, that
are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments
recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable
price changes. These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair value
tables when applicable price changes are observable.

(a)The period-end carrying values reflect cumulative purchases and sales in
addition to upward and downward carrying value changes.

(b)The cumulative upward carrying value changes between January 1, 2018 and
December 31, 2022 were $1.4 billion.

(c)The cumulative downward carrying value changes/impairment between January
1, 2018 and December 31, 2022 were $(918) million.

Included in other assets above is the Firm's interest in Visa Class B common
shares ("Visa B shares") recorded at a nominal carrying value. In November
2022, the Firm sold approximately 3 million Visa B shares, resulting in a net
pretax gain of $914 million recorded in other income. Visa B shares are
subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A
common shares ("Visa A shares") at a specified conversion rate upon final
resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. In connection with
the sale, and consistent with the Firm's sale of 20 million Visa B shares in
2013, the Firm entered into a derivative instrument with the purchaser of the
shares, under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the
conversion rate.

Under the terms of the derivative instrument, the Firm will (a) make or
receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate and (b)
make periodic interest payments to the purchaser of the Visa B shares. The
payments under the derivative continue as long as the Visa B shares remain
subject to transfer restrictions. The derivative is accounted for at fair
value using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon the Firm's estimate
of the timing and magnitude of final resolution of the litigation matters. The
derivative is recorded in trading liabilities and changes in fair value are
recognized in other income. As of December 31, 2022, the Firm held derivative
instruments associated with the 23 million Visa B shares that it has sold,
which are all subject to similar terms and conditions.

As of December 31, 2022, the Firm's remaining interest in Visa B shares was
approximately 37 million shares. On January 5, 2023, Visa filed a Current
Report on Form 8-K with the SEC indicating that the conversion rate of Visa B
shares to Visa A shares decreased from 1.6059 to 1.5991 effective December 29,
2022. The conversion rate may be further adjusted by Visa depending on
developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those
litigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may
have on the conversion rate, is unknown, and accordingly, as of December 31,
2022, there is significant uncertainty regarding the date of the termination
of transfer restrictions and the value of the final conversion rate. As a
result of this, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B shares are not
considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and they continue to be held at
their nominal carrying value.

Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are
not carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value

U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of certain financial
instruments, which are included in the following table. However, this table
does not include other items, such as nonfinancial assets, intangible assets,
certain financial instruments, and customer relationships. In the opinion of
management, these items, in the aggregate, add significant value to JPMorgan
Chase, but their fair value is not disclosed in this table.

Financial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair value

Certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the
Consolidated balance sheets are carried at amounts that approximate fair
value, due to their short-term nature and generally negligible credit risk.
These instruments include cash and due from banks, deposits with banks,
federal funds sold, securities purchased under resale agreements and
securities borrowed, short-term receivables and accrued interest receivable,
short-term borrowings, federal funds purchased, securities loaned and sold
under repurchase agreements, accounts payable, and

accrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the fair value of
deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain
money market deposits) be

equal to their carrying value; recognition of the inherent funding value of
these instruments is not permitted.

The following table presents, by fair value hierarchy classification, the
carrying values and estimated fair values at December 31, 2022 and 2021, of
financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments that are
carried at fair value on a recurring basis, and their classification within
the fair value hierarchy.

(a)Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that
incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal,
contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs,
including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates,
and primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the
fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral.
Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan's allowance for loan
losses, which represents the loan's expected credit losses over its remaining
expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying
value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates,
including credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that
affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.

(b)Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current
presentation.

The majority of the Firm's lending-related commitments are not carried at fair
value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying
value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related
commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firm can reduce or cancel
these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as
permitted by law, without notice. Refer to page 169 of this Note for a further
discussion of the valuation of lending-related commitments.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Note 3 - Fair value option

The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value for selected
financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and
written loan commitments.

The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several
reasons including to mitigate income statement volatility caused by the
differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g.,
certain instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis)
and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted for on a
fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are
managed on a fair value basis.

The Firm's election of fair value includes the following instruments:

•Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity,
subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed on a fair value basis, including
lending-related commitments

•Certain securities financing agreements

•Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain
embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise be required to be
separately accounted for as a derivative instrument

•Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are predominantly
financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives, that are issued or
transacted as part of client-driven activities

•Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB's consolidated
securitization trusts where the underlying assets are carried at fair value

regarding interest income and interest expense.

Determination of instrument-specific credit risk for items for which the fair
value option was elected

The following describes how the gains and losses that are attributable to
changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were determined.

•Loans and lending-related commitments: For floating-rate instruments, all
changes in value are attributed to instrument-specific credit risk. For fixed-
rate instruments, an allocation of the changes in value for the period is made
between those changes in value that are interest rate-related and changes in
value that are credit-related. Allocations are generally based on an analysis
of borrower-specific credit spread and recovery

information, where available, or benchmarking to similar entities or
industries.

•Long-term debt: Changes in value attributable to instrument-specific credit
risk were derived principally from observable changes in the Firm's credit
spread as observed in the bond market.

•Securities financing agreements: Generally, for these types of agreements,
there is a requirement that collateral be maintained with a market value equal
to or in excess of the principal amount loaned; as a result, there would be no
adjustment or an immaterial adjustment for instrument-specific credit risk
related to these agreements.

(b)There were no performing loans that were ninety days or more past due as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021.

(c)Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected
structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-
protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the
Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity,
nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do
not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but
for structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an
underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However,
investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both
nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.

(d)Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes,
the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if
applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm's next call date.

(e)Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current
presentation.

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the contractual amount of lending-related
commitments for which the fair value option was elected was $7.6 billion and
$11.9 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $24 million
and $10 million, respectively. Refer to Note 28 for further information

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Note 4 - Credit risk concentrations

Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of clients, counterparties
or customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the
same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that would
cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected
by changes in economic conditions.

JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit portfolios to
assess potential credit risk concentrations and to obtain additional
collateral when deemed necessary and permitted under the Firm's agreements.
Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval and review
process, and risk levels are adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm's risk
appetite.

In the Firm's consumer portfolio, concentrations are managed primarily by
product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus on trends and
concentrations at the portfolio level, where potential credit risk
concentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting policies and
portfolio guidelines. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the
geographic composition of the Firm's consumer loan portfolios. In the
wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by
industry and monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on
an individual client or counterparty basis.

The Firm's wholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and
participations, loan sales, securitizations, credit derivatives, master
netting agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques. Refer to
Note 12 for additional information on loans.

The Firm does not believe that its exposure to any particular loan product or
industry segment results in a significant concentration of credit risk.

Terms of loan products and collateral coverage are included in the Firm's
assessment when extending credit and establishing its allowance for loan
losses.

information on exposures to SPEs.

(f)Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to
brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets
maintained in the clients' brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, liquid
and readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this
collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is generally held against
these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin
requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and
requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce
positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued
interest and accounts receivable on the Firm's Consolidated balance sheets.

(g)Excludes cash placed with banks of $556.6 billion and $729.6 billion, at
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which is predominantly placed with
various central banks, primarily Federal Reserve Banks.

(h)Credit exposure is net of risk participations and excludes the benefit of
credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities held against
derivative receivables or loans and liquid securities and other cash
collateral held against derivative receivables.

(i)At December 31, 2022 and 2021, included $350 million and $5.4 billion of
loans in Business Banking under the PPP, respectively. PPP loans are
guaranteed by the SBA. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm
typically does not recognize charge-offs, classify as nonaccrual nor record an
allowance for loan losses on these loans.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Note 5 - Derivative instruments

Derivative contracts derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices,
reference rates, other inputs or a combination of these factors and may expose
counterparties to risks and rewards of an underlying asset or liability
without having to initially invest in, own or exchange the asset or liability.
JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses
derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly all of
the Firm's derivatives are entered into for market-making or risk management
purposes.

Market-making derivatives

The majority of the Firm's derivatives are entered into for market-making
purposes. Clients use derivatives to mitigate or modify interest rate, credit,
foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks. The Firm actively manages the
risks from its exposure to these derivatives by entering into other derivative
contracts or by purchasing or selling other financial instruments that
partially or fully offset the exposure from client derivatives.

Risk management derivatives

The Firm manages certain market and credit risk exposures using derivative
instruments, including derivatives in hedge accounting relationships and other
derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and
liabilities.

The Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage the risk
associated with changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities
appreciate or depreciate in market value as interest rates change. Similarly,
interest income and expense increase or decrease as a result of variable-rate
assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a result of
the repayment and subsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and
liabilities at current market rates. Gains and losses on the derivative
instruments related to these assets and liabilities are expected to
substantially offset this variability.

Foreign currency derivatives are used to manage the foreign exchange risk
associated with certain foreign currency-denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar)
assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as the Firm's net
investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional
currencies are not the U.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in foreign
currencies, the U.S. dollar-equivalent values of the foreign currency-
denominated assets and liabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses
increase or decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments related to
these foreign currency-denominated assets or liabilities, or forecasted
transactions, are expected to substantially offset this variability.

Commodities derivatives are used to manage the price risk of certain
commodities inventories. Gains or losses on these derivative instruments are
expected to substantially offset the depreciation or appreciation of the
related inventory.

Credit derivatives are used to manage the counterparty credit risk associated
with loans and lending-related commitments. Credit derivatives compensate the
purchaser when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a credit
event, such as bankruptcy or a failure to pay an obligation when due. Credit
derivatives primarily consist of CDS. Refer to the Credit derivatives section
on pages 205-207 of this Note for a further discussion of credit derivatives.

Refer to the risk management derivatives gains and losses table on page 205
and the hedge accounting gains and losses tables on pages 202-204 of this Note
for more information about risk management derivatives.

Derivative counterparties and settlement types

The Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated and settled
bilaterally with the derivative counterparty. The Firm also enters into, as
principal, certain ETD such as futures and options, and OTC-cleared derivative
contracts with CCPs. ETD contracts are generally standardized contracts traded
on an exchange and cleared by the CCP, which is the Firm's counterparty from
the inception of the transactions. OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a
bilateral basis and then novated to the CCP for clearing.

Derivative clearing services

The Firm provides clearing services for clients in which the Firm acts as a
clearing member at certain exchanges and clearing houses. The Firm does not
reflect the clients' derivative contracts in its Consolidated Financial
Statements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on the Firm's clearing
services.

Accounting for derivatives

All free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account are
required to be recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value.

As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative assets and liabilities,
and the related cash collateral receivables and payables, when a legally
enforceable master netting agreement exists between the Firm and the
derivative counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the
offsetting of assets and liabilities. The accounting for changes in value of a
derivative depends on whether or not the transaction has been designated and
qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges
are reported and measured at fair value through earnings. The tabular
disclosures on pages 198-205 of this Note provide additional information on
the amount of, and reporting for, derivative assets, liabilities, gains and
losses. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for a further discussion of derivatives
embedded in structured notes.

Derivatives designated as hedges

The Firm applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives executed for risk
management purposes - generally interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity
derivatives. However, JPMorgan Chase does not seek to apply hedge accounting
to all of the derivatives associated with the Firm's risk management
activities. For example, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to purchased
CDS used to manage the credit risk of loans and lending-related commitments,
because of the difficulties in qualifying such contracts as hedges. For the
same reason, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to certain interest
rate, foreign exchange, and commodity derivatives used for risk management
purposes.

To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly effective at
reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In addition, for
a derivative to be designated as a hedge, the risk management objective and
strategy must be documented. Hedge documentation must identify the derivative
hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction and type
of risk to be hedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed
prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, the Firm uses
statistical methods such as regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such
as dollar-value comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative
to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, and
qualitative comparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any changes in
those terms. The extent to which a derivative has been, and is expected to
continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or
cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and documented at least
quarterly. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at
hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued.

There are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair value hedges,
cash flow hedges and net investment hedges. JPMorgan Chase uses fair value
hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term debt, AFS securities and
certain commodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the changes
in the fair value of the derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for
the risk being hedged, are recognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded
from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and recognized in
earnings over the life of the derivative. If the hedge relationship is
terminated, then the adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as
part of the basis of the hedged item, and for benchmark interest rate hedges,
is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts affecting
earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item
- primarily net interest income and principal transactions revenue.

JPMorgan Chase uses cash flow hedges primarily to hedge the exposure to
variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate assets and liabilities
and foreign currency-denominated revenue and expense. For qualifying cash flow
hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are

recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged item affects
earnings. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with
the classification of the hedged item - primarily noninterest revenue, net
interest income and compensation expense. If the hedge relationship is
terminated, then the change in value of the derivative recorded in AOCI is
recognized in earnings when the cash flows that were hedged affect earnings.
For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted transaction
is expected to not occur according to the original hedge forecast, any related
derivative values recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings.

JPMorgan Chase uses net investment hedges to protect the value of the Firm's
net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional
currencies are not the U.S. dollar. For qualifying net investment hedges,
changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to changes in spot foreign
exchange rates are recorded in OCI as translation adjustments. Amounts
excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in
earnings.

For most derivative contracts, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is
simply a reference amount used to calculate payments.

Derivatives netting

The following tables present, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, gross and net
derivative receivables and payables by contract and settlement type.
Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral
from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance
sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect
to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been
either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the
Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are
shown separately in the tables below.

In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented
on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and
transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These
amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm's
derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation:

•collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held
at third-party custodians, which are shown separately as "Collateral not
nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets" in the tables below, up to the
fair value exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition
of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid
assets as defined in the LCR rule;

•the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value
exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, which
is excluded from the tables below; and

•collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or
payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or
obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from
the tables below.

Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features

In addition to the specific market risks introduced by each derivative
contract type, derivatives expose JPMorgan Chase to credit risk -- the risk
that derivative counterparties may fail to meet their payment obligations
under the derivative contracts and the collateral, if any, held by the Firm
proves to be of insufficient value to cover the payment obligation. It is the
policy of JPMorgan Chase to actively pursue, where possible, the use of
legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements to
mitigate derivative counterparty credit risk inherent in derivative
receivables.

While derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative
payables expose the Firm to liquidity risk, as the derivative contracts
typically require the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with
counterparties as the fair value of the contracts moves in the counterparties'
favor or upon specified downgrades in the Firm's and its subsidiaries'
respective credit ratings. Certain derivative contracts also provide for
termination of the contract, generally upon a downgrade of either the Firm or
the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative contracts. The following
table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC
and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination
features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated
collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at December
31, 2022 and 2021.

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade
of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries,
predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at December 31, 2022 and 2021,
related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral
or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade.
Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or
terminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is breached.
A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower
than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating
agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain
instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings
downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements. The liquidity impact in
the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating
of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial
asset

In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers
financial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets
by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of
the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as
collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 11, but in limited
circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative
under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where
the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at both December
31, 2022 and 2021.

(a)Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., Secured Overnight
Financing Rate ("SOFR"), London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR")) interest
rate risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses
were recorded in net interest income.

(b)Effective January 1, 2022, the Firm updated its presentation in the tables
above to include the amortization of income/expense associated with the
inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item; prior-period
amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Excludes
the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.

(c)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt
and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and
losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in
foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components
were recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest
income.

(d)Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories
that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net
realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in
principal transactions revenue.

(e)The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the
changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward
points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency
basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through
amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative or through
fair value changes recognized in the current period.

(f)Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of
effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross-currency
basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in
earnings over the life of the derivative.

(a)Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $26.0 billion and
$25.7 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, to which the Firm
applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge
accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing
unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these
positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income in
future periods.

(b)Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated
hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not
reverse through the income statement in future periods. At December 31, 2022
and 2021, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities is $20.3 billion and
$14.0 billion, respectively, and for long-term debt is $221 million and $9.7
billion, respectively. Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with
the current presentation.

(c)Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if
applicable. Refer to Note 10 for additional information.

(d)Positive (negative) amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair
value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce (increase) net interest income
in future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities
represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase
(reduce) net interest income in future periods.

(e)Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated
with hedged items that have been de-designated from qualifying fair value

Cash flow hedge gains and losses

The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in
cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses)
recorded on such derivatives, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and
2020, respectively. The Firm includes the gains/(losses) on the hedging
derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as
the change in cash flows on the related hedged item.

(b)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S.
dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of
gains and losses follows the hedged item - primarily noninterest revenue and
compensation expense.

The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur
for the years ended 2022, 2021 and 2020.

Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $(1.5) billion
(after-tax) of net losses recorded in AOCI at December 31, 2022, related to
cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have
been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results
recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is approximately seven years,
corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows.
For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted
transactions are hedged is approximately seven years. The Firm's longer-dated
forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.

Net investment hedge gains and losses

The following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were
used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax
gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the years ended December 31,

million and $3 million to other income/expense related to the liquidation of
certain legal entities during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020,
respectively. The amount reclassified for the year ended December 31, 2021 was

Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk management purposes

The following table presents pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on a limited
number of derivatives, not designated in hedge accounting relationships, that
are used to manage risks associated with certain specified assets and
liabilities, including certain risks arising from mortgage commitments,
warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, and foreign currency
denominated assets and liabilities.

as written commitments to originate warehouse loans. Gains and losses were
recorded predominantly in mortgage fees and related income.

(b)Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated with
lending exposures in the Firm's wholesale businesses. These derivatives do not
include credit derivatives used to mitigate counterparty credit risk arising
from derivative receivables, which is included in gains and losses on
derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives. Gains
and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.

(c)Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk of
specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains and
losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.

Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other
derivatives

The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers
and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk
positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit
risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the
hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above are included in
this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in
principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 6 for information on principal
transactions revenue.

Credit derivatives

Credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the
credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference
entity) and which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that
risk to another party (the protection seller). Credit derivatives expose the
protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller, as the
protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the
reference entity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a failure
to pay its obligation or a restructuring. The seller of credit protection
receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the
underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit
event.

The Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit
derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes. First,
in its capacity as a market-maker, the Firm actively manages a portfolio of
credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly
on corporate debt obligations, to meet the needs of customers. Second, as an
end-user, the Firm uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk associated
with lending exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) in its wholesale and
consumer businesses and derivatives counterparty exposures in its wholesale
businesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from certain financial
instruments in the Firm's market-making businesses. Following is a summary of
various types of credit derivatives.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Credit default swaps

Credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single reference
entity ("single-name"), broad-based index or portfolio. The Firm purchases and
sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations. Single-
name CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared derivative
contracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage the default risk of a single
reference entity, while index CDS contracts are used to manage the credit risk
associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments. Like the
S&P 500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio of CDS
across many reference entities. New series of CDS indices are periodically
established with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect
changes in the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the index
experiences a credit event, then the reference entity that defaulted is
removed from the index. CDS can also be referenced against specific portfolios
of reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific
client demands: for example, to provide protection against the first $1
million of realized credit losses in a $10 million portfolio of exposure. Such
structures are commonly known as tranche CDS.

For both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS contracts, upon the
occurrence of a credit event, under the terms of a CDS contract neither party
to the CDS contract has recourse to the reference entity. The protection
purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the
face value of the CDS contract and the fair value of the reference obligation
at settlement of the credit derivative contract, also known as the recovery
value. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of
the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the CDS
contract when a credit event occurs.

Credit-related notes

A credit-related note is a funded derivative with a credit risk component
where the issuer of the credit-related note purchases from the note investor
credit protection on a reference entity or an index. Under the contract, the
investor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the inception of the
transaction, and in return, the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor,
based on the credit risk of the referenced entity. The issuer also repays the
investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity (or
one of the entities that makes up a reference index) experiences a specified
credit event. If a credit event occurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay
the par value of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the investor the
difference between the par value of the note and the fair value of the
defaulted reference obligation at the time of settlement. Neither party to the
credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting reference entity.

The following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit
derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of
protection would typically pay out only a percentage of the full notional
amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid on
the contracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference
obligation at the time of settlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on
contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or
similar underlying reference entities. Other purchased protection referenced
in the following tables includes credit derivatives bought on related, but not
identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio coverage and
other reference points) as well as protection purchased by CIB through credit-
related notes primarily in its market-making businesses. In addition, the Firm
obtains credit protection against certain loans in the retained consumer
portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes. Since these credit-
related notes are not part of the market-making businesses they are not
included in the table below.

The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary
measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount
does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit
event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash
instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm's view,
the risks associated with such derivatives.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Note 6 - Noninterest revenue and noninterest expense

Noninterest revenue

The Firm records noninterest revenue from certain contracts with customers in
investment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management,
administration, and commissions, and components of card income. The related
contracts are often terminable on demand and the Firm has no remaining
obligation to deliver future services. For arrangements with a fixed term, the
Firm may commit to deliver services in the future. Revenue associated with
these remaining performance obligations typically depends on the occurrence of
future events or underlying asset values, and is not recognized until the
outcome of those events or values are known.

Investment banking fees

This revenue category includes debt and equity underwriting and advisory fees.
As an underwriter, the Firm helps clients raise capital via public offering
and private placement of various types of debt and equity instruments.
Underwriting fees are primarily based on the issuance price and quantity of
the underlying instruments, and are recognized as revenue typically upon
execution of the client's transaction. The Firm also manages and syndicates
loan arrangements. Credit arrangement and syndication fees, included within
debt underwriting fees, are recorded as revenue after satisfying certain
retention, timing and yield criteria.

The Firm also provides advisory services, by assisting its clients with
mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring and other complex
transactions. Advisory fees are recognized as revenue typically upon execution
of the client's transaction.

The following table presents the components of investment banking fees.

Investment banking fees are earned primarily by CIB. Refer to Note 32 for
segment results.

Principal transactions

Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including:

•the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which a
market participant is willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and
the price at which another market participant is willing and able to buy it
from the Firm, and vice versa; and

•realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments and
commodities transactions, including those accounted for under the fair value
option, primarily used in client-driven market-making activities, and on
private equity investments.

-Realized gains and losses result from the sale of instruments, closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments. 

-Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in valuation. 

In connection with its client-driven market-making activities, the Firm
transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities,
including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that
reference commodities.

Principal transactions revenue also includes realized and unrealized gains and
losses related to:

•derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships,
primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk;

•derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate
credit, foreign exchange and interest rate risks.

Refer to Note 5 for further information on the income statement classification
of gains and losses from derivatives activities.

In the financial commodity markets, the Firm transacts in OTC derivatives
(e.g., swaps, forwards, options) and ETD that reference a wide range of
underlying commodities. In the physical commodity markets, the Firm primarily
purchases and sells precious and base metals and may hold other commodities
inventories under financing and other arrangements with clients.

The following table presents all realized and unrealized gains and losses
recorded in principal transactions revenue. This table excludes interest
income and interest expense on trading assets and liabilities, which are an
integral part of the overall performance of the Firm's client-driven market-
making activities in CIB and fund deployment activities in Treasury and CIO.
Refer to Note 7 for further information on interest income and interest
expense.

Trading revenue is presented primarily by instrument type. The Firm's client-
driven market-making businesses generally utilize a variety of instrument
types in connection with their market-making and related risk-management
activities; accordingly, the trading revenue presented in the table below is
not representative of the total revenue of any individual LOB.

Asset management, administration and commissions

This revenue category includes fees from investment management and related
services, custody, brokerage services and other products. The Firm manages
assets on behalf of its clients, including investors in Firm-sponsored funds
and owners of separately managed investment accounts. Management fees are
typically based on the value of assets under management and are collected and
recognized at the end of each period over which the management services are
provided and the value of the managed assets is known. The Firm also receives
performance-based management fees, which are earned based on exceeding certain
benchmarks or other performance targets and are accrued and recognized when
the probability of reversal is remote, typically at the end of the related
billing period. The Firm has contractual arrangements with third parties to
provide distribution and other services in connection with its asset
management activities. Amounts paid to these third-party service

providers are generally recorded in professional and outside services expense.

services, such as commissions earned on the sales or distribution of mutual
funds to clients. These fees are recorded as revenue at the time the service
is rendered or, in the case of certain distribution fees based on the
underlying fund's asset value and/or investor redemption, recorded over time
as the investor remains in the fund or upon investor redemption.

(c)Predominantly includes fees for custody, securities lending, funds services
and securities clearance. These fees are recorded as revenue over the period
in which the related service is provided.

(d)Represents commissions earned when the Firm acts as a broker, by
facilitating its clients' purchases and sales of securities and other
financial instruments. Brokerage commissions are collected and recognized as
revenue upon occurrence of the client transaction. The Firm reports certain
costs paid to third-party clearing houses and exchanges net against commission
revenue.

(e)Includes travel-related and annuity sales commissions, depositary receipt-
related service fees, as well as other service fees, which are recognized as
revenue when the services are rendered.

Asset management, administration and commissions are earned primarily by AWM,
CIB and CCB. Refer to Note 32 for segment results.

Mortgage fees and related income

This revenue category reflects CCB's Home Lending production and net mortgage
servicing revenue.

Production revenue includes fees and income recognized as earned on mortgage
loans originated with the intent to sell, and the impact of risk management
activities associated with the mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans.
Production revenue also includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost
or fair value adjustments on mortgage loans held-for-sale (excluding certain
repurchased loans insured by U.S. government agencies), and changes in the
fair value of financial instruments measured under the fair value option. Net
mortgage servicing revenue includes operating revenue earned from servicing
third-party mortgage loans, which is recognized over the period in which the
service is provided; changes in the fair value of MSRs; the impact of risk
management activities associated

with MSRs; and gains and losses on securitization of excess mortgage
servicing. Net mortgage servicing revenue also includes gains and losses on
sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments of certain repurchased loans
insured by U.S. government agencies.

Refer to Note 15 for further information on risk management activities and
MSRs.

Net interest income from mortgage loans is recorded in interest income.

Card income

This revenue category includes interchange and other income from credit and
debit card transactions; and fees earned from processing card transactions for
merchants, both of which are recognized when purchases are made by a
cardholder and presented net of certain transaction-related costs. Card income
also includes account origination costs and annual fees, which are deferred
and recognized on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period.

Certain credit card products offer the cardholder the ability to earn points
based on account activity, which the cardholder can choose to redeem for cash
and non-cash rewards. The cost to the Firm related to these proprietary
rewards programs varies based on multiple factors including the terms and
conditions of the rewards programs, cardholder activity, cardholder reward
redemption rates and cardholder reward selections. The Firm maintains a
liability for its obligations under its rewards programs and reports the
current-period cost as a reduction of card income.

Credit card revenue sharing agreements

The Firm has contractual agreements with numerous co-brand partners that grant
the Firm exclusive rights to issue co-branded credit card products and market
them to the customers of such partners. These partners endorse the co-brand
credit card programs and provide their customer or member lists to the Firm.
The partners may also conduct marketing activities and provide rewards
redeemable under their own loyalty programs that the Firm will grant to co-
brand credit cardholders based on account activity. The terms of these
agreements generally range from five to ten years.

The Firm typically makes payments to the co-brand credit card partners based
on the cost of partners' marketing activities and loyalty program rewards
provided to credit cardholders, new account originations and sales volumes.
Payments to partners based on marketing efforts undertaken by the partners are
expensed by the Firm as incurred and reported as marketing expense. Payments
for partner loyalty program rewards are reported as a reduction of card income
when incurred. Payments to partners based on new credit card account
originations are accounted for as direct loan origination costs and are
deferred and recognized as a reduction of card income on a straight-line basis
over a 12-month period. Payments to partners based on sales volumes are
reported as a reduction of card income when the related interchange

income is earned.

associated with the Firm's tax-oriented investments, predominantly alternative
energy equity-method investments in CIB.

value, the related interest is included within interest income or interest
expense, as applicable. Refer to Notes 12, 10, 11 and 20 for further
information on accounting for interest income and interest expense related to
loans, investment securities, securities financing activities (i.e.,

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Note 8 - Pension and other postretirement

employee benefit plans

The Firm has various defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans that provide
benefits to its employees in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. locations.
Substantially all the defined benefit pension plans are closed to new
participants. The principal defined benefit pension plan in the U.S., which
covered substantially all U.S. employees, was closed to new participants and
frozen for existing participants on January 1, 2020, (and January 1, 2019 for
new hires on or after December 2, 2017). Interest credits continue to accrue
to participants' accounts based on their accumulated balances.

The Firm maintains funded and unfunded postretirement benefit plans that
provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees and retirees
as well as their

dependents covered under these programs. None of these plans have a material
impact on the Firm's Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Firm also provides a qualified defined contribution plan in the U.S. and
maintains other similar arrangements in certain non-U.S. locations. The most
significant of these plans is the JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan ("the
401(k) Savings Plan"), which covers substantially all U.S. employees.
Employees can contribute to the 401(k) Savings Plan on a pretax and/or Roth
401(k) after-tax basis. The Firm makes an annual matching contribution as well
as an annual profit-sharing contribution to the 401(k) Savings Plan on behalf
of eligible participants.

The following table presents the pretax benefit obligations, plan assets, the
net funded status, and the amounts recorded in AOCI on the Consolidated
balance sheets for the Firm's significant defined benefit pension and OPEB
plans.

| | | | | | | | | | | |

pension and OPEB plans

Net funded status| 6,345 | | | 7,646 | |  
Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)| (1,916)| | | (453)| |  
  
The weighted-average discount rate used to value the benefit obligations as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, was 5.14% and 2.54%, respectively.

Gains and losses

Gains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit obligation and the fair
value of plan assets are recorded in OCI. Amortization of net gains or losses
are recognized as part of the net periodic benefit cost over subsequent
periods, if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds 10%
of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of the
plan assets. Amortization is generally over the average expected remaining
lifetime of plan participants, given the frozen status of most plans. During
the year ended December 31, 2022, a remeasurement of the Firm's U.S. principal
defined benefit plan in the third quarter, was required as a result of a

pension settlement. The remeasurement resulted in a reduction in the fair
value of the Firm's U.S. principal defined benefit plan assets, reflecting
market conditions at the time of remeasurement, and a reduction in the plan's
projected benefit obligation totaling $4.0 billion and $2.6 billion,
respectively, resulting in a net decrease of $1.4 billion in pre-tax AOCI. For
the year ended December 31, 2021, the net gain was predominantly attributable
to market-driven increases in the fair value of plan assets and the discount
rate.

The following table presents the net periodic benefit costs reported in the
Consolidated statements of income for the Firm's defined benefit pension,
defined contribution and OPEB plans, and in other comprehensive income for the
defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.

The following table presents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions used
to determine the net periodic benefit costs for the defined benefit pension
and OPEB plans.

| | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| Defined benefit pension and OPEB plans  
Year ended December 31,| 2022| 2021| 2020|  
Discount rate| 2.54 | %| 2.17 | %| 2.93 | %|  
Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets| 3.68 | %| 2.97 | %| 3.91 |
%|  
  
Plan assumptions

The Firm's expected long-term rate of return is a blended weighted average, by
asset allocation of the projected long-term returns for the various asset
classes, taking into consideration local market conditions and the specific
allocation of plan assets. Returns on asset classes are developed using a
forward-looking approach and are not strictly based on historical returns,
with consideration given to current market conditions and the portfolio mix of
each plan.

The discount rates used in determining the benefit obligations are generally
provided by the Firm's actuaries, with the Firm's principal defined benefit
pension plan using a rate that was selected by reference to the yields on
portfolios of bonds with maturity dates and coupons that closely match each of
the plan's projected cash flows.

Investment strategy and asset allocation

The assets of the Firm's defined benefit pension plans are held in various
trusts and are invested in well-diversified portfolios of equity and fixed
income securities, cash and cash equivalents, and alternative investments. The
Firm regularly reviews the asset allocations and asset managers, as well as
other factors that could impact the portfolios, which are rebalanced when
deemed necessary. The approved asset allocation ranges by asset class for the
Firm's principal defined benefit plan are 42-100% debt securities, 0-40%
equity securities, 0-3% real estate, and 0-12% alternatives as of December 31,
2022.

As of December 31, 2022, assets held by the Firm's defined benefit pension and
OPEB plans do not include securities issued by JPMorgan Chase or its
affiliates, except through indirect exposures through investments in exchange
traded funds, mutual funds and collective investment funds managed by third-
parties. The defined benefit pension and OPEB plans hold investments that are
sponsored or managed by affiliates of JPMorgan Chase in the amount of $1.7
billion and $2.5 billion, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Fair value measurement of the plans' assets and liabilities

Refer to Note 2 for information on fair value measurements, including
descriptions of level 1, 2, and 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the
valuation methods employed by the Firm.

Changes in level 3 fair value measurements using significant unobservable
inputs

Investments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy decreased in
2022 to $2.6 billion, due to $501 million in unrealized losses and $54 million
in settlements, and increased in 2021 to $3.2 billion, predominantly due to
$332 million in unrealized gains, partially offset by $94 million in
settlements.

Note 9 - Employee share-based incentives

Employee share-based awards

In 2022, 2021 and 2020, JPMorgan Chase granted long-term share-based awards to
certain employees under its LTIP, as amended and restated effective May 15,
2018, and subsequently amended effective May 18, 2021. Under the terms of the
LTIP, as of December 31, 2022, 69 million shares of common stock were
available for issuance through May 2025\. The LTIP is the only active plan
under which the Firm is currently granting share-based incentive awards. In
the following discussion, the LTIP, plus prior Firm plans and plans assumed as
the result of acquisitions, are referred to collectively as the "LTI Plans,"
and such plans constitute the Firm's share-based incentive plans.

RSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their grant. Generally, RSUs
are granted annually and vest at a rate of 50% after two years and 50% after
three years and are converted into shares of common stock as of the vesting
date. In addition, RSUs typically include full-career eligibility provisions,
which allow employees to continue to vest upon voluntary termination based on
age and/or service-related requirements, subject to post-employment and other
restrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture until vested and
contain clawback provisions that may result in cancellation under certain
specified circumstances. Predominantly all RSUs entitle the recipient to
receive cash payments equivalent to any dividends paid on the underlying
common stock during the period the RSUs are outstanding.

Performance share units ("PSUs") are granted annually, and approved by the
Firm's Board of Directors, to members of the Firm's Operating Committee under
the variable compensation program. PSUs are subject to the Firm's achievement
of specified performance criteria over a three-year period. The number of
awards that vest can range from zero to 150% of the grant amount. In addition,
dividends that accrue during the vesting period are reinvested in dividend
equivalent share units. PSUs and the related dividend equivalent share units
are converted into shares of common stock after vesting.

Once the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units have vested, the shares of
common stock that are delivered, after applicable tax withholding, must be
retained for an additional holding period, for a total combined vesting and
holding period of approximately five to eight years from the grant date
depending on regulations in certain countries.

Under the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights ("SARs") and stock options have
generally been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of
JPMorgan Chase's common stock on the grant date. SARs and stock options
generally expire ten years after the grant date. In 2021, the Firm awarded its
Chairman and CEO and its President and Chief Operating Officer 1.5 million and
750,000 SARs, respectively. There were no grants of SARs or stock options in
2022 and grants in 2020 were not material.

The Firm separately recognizes compensation expense for each tranche of each
award, net of estimated forfeitures, as if it were a separate award with its
own vesting date. Generally, for each tranche granted, compensation expense is
recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the vesting date
of the respective tranche, provided that the employees will not become full-
career eligible during the vesting period. For awards with full-career
eligibility provisions and awards granted with no future substantive service
requirement, the Firm accrues the estimated value of awards expected to be
awarded to employees as of the grant date without giving consideration to the
impact of post-employment restrictions. For each tranche granted to employees
who will become full-career eligible during the vesting period, compensation
expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the
earlier of the employee's full-career eligibility date or the vesting date of
the respective tranche.

The Firm's policy for issuing shares upon settlement of employee share-based
incentive awards is to issue either new shares of common stock or treasury
shares. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Firm settled all of its employee
share-based awards by issuing treasury shares.

Refer to Note 23 for further information on the classification of share-based
awards for purposes of calculating earnings per share.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

RSUs, PSUs, SARs and stock options activity

Generally, compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs is measured based on the
number of units granted multiplied by the stock price at the grant date, and
for SARs and stock options, is measured at the grant date using the Black-
Scholes valuation model. Compensation expense for these awards is recognized
in net income as described previously. The following table summarizes JPMorgan
Chase's RSUs, PSUs, SARs and stock options activity for 2022.

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

The total fair value of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31,
2022, 2021 and 2020, was $3.2 billion, $2.9 billion and $2.8 billion,
respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years
ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, was $75 million, $232 million and $182
million, respectively.

Compensation expense

The Firm recognized the following noncash compensation expense related to its
various employee share-based incentive plans in its Consolidated statements of
income.

plans

| | $| 2,794 | | | $| 2,929 | | | $| 2,451 |  
  
At December 31, 2022, approximately $1.0 billion (pretax) of compensation
expense related to unvested awards had not yet been charged to net income.
That cost is expected to be amortized into compensation expense over a
weighted-average period of 1.8 years. The Firm does not capitalize any
compensation expense related to share-based compensation awards to employees.

Tax benefits

Income tax benefits (including tax benefits from dividends or dividend
equivalents) related to share-based incentive arrangements recognized in the
Firm's Consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31,
2022, 2021 and 2020, were $901 million, $957 million and $837 million,
respectively.

Note 10 - Investment securities

Investment securities consist of debt securities that are classified as AFS or
HTM. Debt securities classified as trading assets are discussed in Note 2.
Predominantly all of the Firm's AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury
and CIO in connection with its asset-liability management activities.

AFS securities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets.
Unrealized gains and losses, after any applicable hedge accounting adjustments
or allowance for credit losses, are reported in AOCI. The specific
identification method is used to determine realized gains and losses on AFS
securities, which are included in investment securities gains/(losses) on the
Consolidated statements of income. HTM securities, which the Firm has the
intent and ability to hold until maturity, are carried at amortized cost, net
of allowance for credit losses, on the Consolidated balance sheets.

For both AFS and HTM securities, purchase discounts or premiums are generally
amortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over the contractual
life of the security. However, premiums on certain callable debt securities
are amortized to the earliest call date.

During 2022 and 2021, the Firm transferred $78.3 billion and $104.5 billion of
investment securities, respectively, from AFS to HTM for capital management
purposes. AOCI included pretax unrealized gains/(losses) of $(4.8) billion and
$425 million, respectively, on the securities at the dates of transfer.

Unrealized gains or losses at the date of transfer of these securities
continue to be reported in AOCI and are amortized into interest income on a
level-yield basis over the remaining life of the securities. This amortization
will offset the effect on interest income of the amortization of the premium
or discount resulting from the transfer recorded at fair value.

Transfers of securities from AFS to HTM are non-cash transactions and are
recorded at fair value.

(c)Excludes $2.5 billion and $1.9 billion of accrued interest receivable at
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, included in accrued interest and
accounts receivable on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm generally
does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest
receivable, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days
past due by reversing interest income. The Firm did not reverse through
interest income any accrued interest receivable for the years ended December
31, 2022 and 2021.

  

At December 31, 2022, the investment securities portfolio consisted of debt
securities with an average credit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings
where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk
ratings). Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of securities
and differentiate risk within the portfolio. The Firm's internal risk ratings
generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity
to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic
environment) defined by S&P and Moody's,

however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., probability of default ("PD")
and loss given default ("LGD")) may differ as they reflect internal historical
experiences and assumptions. Risk ratings are assigned at acquisition,
reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and adjusted
as necessary over the life of the investment for updated information affecting
the issuer's ability to fulfill its obligations.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

AFS securities are considered impaired if the fair value is less than the
amortized cost.

The Firm recognizes impairment losses in earnings if the Firm has the intent
to sell the debt security, or if it is more likely than not that the Firm will
be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost.
In these circumstances the impairment loss is recognized in investment
securities gains/(losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Income and is
equal to the full difference between the amortized cost (net of allowance if
applicable) and the fair value of the security.

For impaired debt securities that the Firm has the intent and ability to hold,
the securities are evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. If it is
determined that a credit loss exists, that loss is recognized as an allowance
for credit losses through the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated
Statements of Income, limited by the amount of impairment. Any impairment on
debt securities that the Firm has the intent and ability to hold not due to
credit losses is recorded in OCI.

Factors considered in evaluating credit losses include adverse conditions
specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition
of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security; and payment structure of
the security.

When assessing securities issued in a securitization for credit losses, the
Firm estimates cash flows considering relevant market and economic data,
underlying loan-level data, and structural features of the securitization,
such as subordination, excess spread, overcollateralization or other forms of
credit enhancement, and compares the losses projected for the underlying
collateral ("pool losses") against the level of credit enhancement in the
securitization structure to determine whether these features are sufficient to
absorb the pool losses, or whether a credit loss exists.

For beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated below "AA" at their
acquisition, or that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such
a way that the Firm would not recover substantially all of its recorded
investment, the Firm evaluates impairment for credit losses when there is an
adverse change in expected cash flows.

  

  

HTM securities - credit risk

Allowance for credit losses

The allowance for credit losses represents expected credit losses over the
remaining expected life of HTM securities.

The allowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of U.S. states and
municipalities and commercial mortgage-backed securities is calculated by
applying statistical credit loss factors (estimated PD and LGD) to the
amortized cost. The credit loss factors are derived using a weighted average
of five internally developed eight-quarter macroeconomic scenarios, followed
by a single year straight-line interpolation to revert to long run historical
information for periods beyond the forecast period. Refer to Note 13 for
further information on the eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast.

The allowance for credit losses on HTM collateralized loan obligations and
U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities

is calculated as the difference between the amortized cost and the present
value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the security's
effective interest rate. These cash flow estimates are developed based on
expectations of underlying collateral performance derived using the eight-
quarter macroeconomic forecast and the single year straight-line
interpolation, as well as considering the structural features of the security.

The application of different inputs and assumptions into the calculation of
the allowance for credit losses is subject to significant management judgment,
and emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other
inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for credit
losses on HTM securities.

Credit quality indicator

The primary credit quality indicator for HTM securities is the risk rating
assigned to each security. At both December 31, 2022 and 2021, all HTM
securities were rated investment grade and were current and accruing, with
approximately 98% rated at least AA+.

  

Allowance for credit losses on investment securities

The allowance for credit losses on investment securities was $96 million, $42
million and $78 million as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(a)Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned
at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each
security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization
of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging
derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The
effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly,
actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected
maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable
debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.

(b)Substantially all of the Firm's U.S. residential MBS and collateralized
mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual
maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated
future prepayments, is approximately eight years for agency residential MBS,
and six years for both agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations
and nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Note 11 - Securities financing activities

JPMorgan Chase enters into resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and
securities loaned agreements (collectively, "securities financing agreements")
primarily to finance the Firm's inventory positions, acquire securities to
cover short sales, accommodate customers' financing needs, settle other
securities obligations and to deploy the Firm's excess cash.

Securities financing agreements are treated as collateralized financings on
the Firm's Consolidated balance sheets. Where appropriate under applicable
accounting guidance, securities financing agreements with the same
counterparty are reported on a net basis. Refer to Note 1 for further
discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. Fees received and paid
in connection with securities financing agreements are recorded over the life
of the agreement in interest income and interest expense on the Consolidated
statements of income.

The Firm has elected the fair value option for certain securities financing
agreements. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding the fair value
option. The securities financing agreements for which the fair value option
has been elected are reported within securities purchased under resale
agreements, securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, and
securities borrowed on the Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for
agreements carried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are
recorded within interest income and interest expense, with changes in fair
value reported in principal transactions revenue. However, for financial
instruments containing embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted
for in accordance with accounting guidance for hybrid instruments, all changes
in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in principal
transactions revenue.

Securities financing agreements not elected under the fair value option are
measured at amortized cost. As a result of the Firm's credit risk mitigation
practices described below, the Firm did not hold any allowance for credit
losses with respect to resale and securities borrowed arrangements as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Credit risk mitigation practices

Securities financing agreements expose the Firm primarily to credit and
liquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm monitors the value of the
underlying securities (predominantly high-quality securities collateral,
including government-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and government agencies MBS)
that it has received from or provided to its counterparties compared to the
value of cash proceeds and exchanged collateral, and either requests
additional collateral or returns securities or collateral when appropriate.
Margin levels are initially established based upon the counterparty, the type
of underlying securities, and the permissible collateral, and are monitored on
an ongoing basis.

In resale and securities borrowed agreements, the Firm is exposed to credit
risk to the extent that the value of the securities received is less than
initial cash principal advanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. In
repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit risk exposure arises to
the extent that the value of underlying securities advanced exceeds the value
of the initial cash principal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged.

Additionally, the Firm typically enters into master netting agreements and
other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide for the
right to liquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts
exchanged in the event of a counterparty default. It is also the Firm's policy
to take possession, where possible, of the securities underlying resale and
securities borrowed agreements. Refer to Note 29 for further information
regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing
agreements.

The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm's securities
financing agreements, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. When the Firm has
obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting
agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under
U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the
balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same
counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash
collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the
counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance
sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion
with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral,
along with

securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting
criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as "Amounts not
nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets," and reduces the "Net amounts"
presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the
securities financing balances are presented gross in the "Net amounts" below.
In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a securities-for-
securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or
sold as collateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value
within other assets and the obligation to return those securities within
accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Note 12 - Loans

Loan accounting framework

The accounting for a loan depends on management's strategy for the loan. The
Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:

•Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., "retained")

•Loans held-for-sale

•Loans at fair value

The following provides a detailed accounting discussion of the Firm's loans by
category:

Loans held-for-investment

Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment, including PCD, are recorded
at amortized cost, reflecting the principal amount outstanding, net of the
following: unamortized deferred loan fees, costs, premiums or discounts;
charge-offs; collection of cash; and foreign exchange. Credit card loans also
include billed finance charges and fees.

Interest income

Interest income on performing loans held-for-investment is accrued and
recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of interest. Purchase
price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are
amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the loan as an
adjustment of yield.

The Firm classifies accrued interest on loans, including accrued but unbilled
interest on credit card loans, in accrued interest and accounts receivables on
the Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, accrued interest once
billed is then recognized in the loan balances, with the related allowance
recorded in the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the allowance for
credit losses on accrued interest on credit card loans are recognized in the
provision for credit losses and charge-offs are recognized by reversing
interest income. For other loans, the Firm generally does not recognize an
allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivables, consistent with
its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing
interest income.

Nonaccrual loans

Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has been
suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans
insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status and
considered nonperforming when full payment of principal and interest is not
expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has
been in default for a period of 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well-
secured and in the process of collection. A loan is determined to be past due
when the minimum payment is not received from the borrower by the
contractually specified due date or for certain loans (e.g., residential real
estate loans), when a monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more.

Finally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual
status.

On the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest accrued but
not collected is reversed against interest income. In addition, the
amortization of deferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual
loans may be recognized as cash interest payments are received (i.e., on a
cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible; however,
if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan
balance, all interest cash receipts are applied to reduce the carrying value
of the loan (the cost recovery method). For consumer loans, application of
this policy typically results in the Firm recognizing interest income on
nonaccrual consumer loans on a cash basis.

A loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured
and there has been demonstrated performance under the terms of the loan or, if
applicable, the terms of the restructured loan.

As permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are generally exempt
from being placed on nonaccrual status; accordingly, interest and fees related
to credit card loans continue to accrue until the loan is charged off or paid
in full.

Allowance for loan losses

The allowance for loan losses represents the estimated expected credit losses
in the held-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and is
recognized on the balance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the amortized
cost to the net carrying value. Changes in the allowance for loan losses are
recorded in the provision for credit losses on the Firm's Consolidated
statements of income. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm's
accounting policies for the allowance for loan losses.

Charge-offs

Consumer loans are generally charged off or charged down to the lower of the
amortized cost or the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e.,
fair value less estimated costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance for
loan losses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency in accordance with
standards established by the FFIEC. Residential real estate loans, unmodified
credit card loans and scored business banking loans are generally charged off
no later than 180 days past due. Scored auto and modified credit card loans
are charged off no later than 120 days past due.

Certain consumer loans are charged off or charged down to their net realizable
value earlier than the FFIEC charge-off standards in the following
circumstances:

•Loans modified in a TDR that are determined to be collateral-dependent.

•Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event that suggests a loss is
either known or highly certain are subject to accelerated charge-off standards
(e.g.,

60 days of receiving notification of a bankruptcy filing).

•Auto loans upon repossession of the automobile.

Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not
recognize charge-offs on the government-guaranteed portion of loans.

Wholesale loans are charged off when it is highly certain that a loss has been
realized. The determination of whether to recognize a charge-off includes many
factors, including the prioritization of the Firm's claim in bankruptcy,
expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the
borrower's equity or the loan collateral.

When a loan is charged down to the lower of its amortized cost or the
estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral, the determination
of the fair value of the collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g.,
securities, real estate). In cases where the collateral is in the form of
liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market prices or broker
quotes. For illiquid securities or other financial assets, the fair value of
the collateral is generally estimated using a discounted cash flow model.

For residential real estate loans, collateral values are based upon external
valuation sources. When it becomes likely that a borrower is either unable or
unwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker's price opinion, appraisal and/or
an automated valuation model of the home based on an exterior-only valuation
("exterior opinions"), which is then updated at least every 12 months, or more
frequently depending on various market factors. As soon as practicable after
the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by taking
legal title or physical possession), the Firm generally obtains an appraisal
based on an inspection that includes the interior of the home ("interior
appraisals"). Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted based
upon the Firm's experience with actual liquidation values as compared with the
estimated values provided by exterior opinions and interior appraisals,
considering state-specific factors.

For commercial real estate loans, collateral values are generally based on
appraisals from internal and external valuation sources. Collateral values are
typically updated every six to twelve months, either by obtaining a new
appraisal or by performing an internal analysis, in accordance with the Firm's
policies. The Firm also considers both borrower- and market-specific factors,
which may result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price opinions at
more frequent intervals.

Loans held-for-sale

Loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with
valuation changes recorded in noninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the
valuation is performed on a portfolio basis. For wholesale loans, the
valuation is performed on an individual loan basis.

Interest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and recognized based on the
contractual rate of interest.

Loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are
deferred in a contra loan account until the related loan is sold. The deferred
fees or costs and discounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the
loan and therefore are included in the periodic determination of the lower of
cost or fair value adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time
of sale.

Because these loans are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the
Firm's allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these
loans. However, loans held-for-sale are subject to the nonaccrual policies
described above.

Loans at fair value

Loans for which the fair value option has been elected are measured at fair
value, with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue.

Interest income on these loans is accrued and recognized based on the
contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair value are recognized in
noninterest revenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront in
noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs are recognized in the associated
expense category as incurred.

Because these loans are recognized at fair value, the Firm's allowance for
loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However,
loans at fair value are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above.

Refer to Note 3 for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value
accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for further
information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.

Loan classification changes

Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are
transferred to the held-for-sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value
on the date of transfer. Credit-related losses are charged against the
allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as those due to
changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are recognized in
noninterest revenue.

In the event that management decides to retain a loan in the held-for-sale
portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-investment portfolio at
amortized cost on the date of transfer. These loans are subsequently assessed
for impairment based on the Firm's allowance methodology. Refer to Note 13 for
a further discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the Firm's
allowance for loan losses.

Loan modifications

The Firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with its loss mitigation
activities. Through the modification, JPMorgan Chase grants one or more
concessions to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to
minimize the Firm's economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of the
collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments received by the Firm from the
borrower. The concessions granted vary by program and by borrower-specific
characteristics, and may include interest rate reductions, term extensions,
payment delays, principal forgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or other
assets in lieu of payments. Such modifications are accounted for and reported
as TDRs. Loans with short-term and other insignificant modifications that are
not considered concessions are not TDRs.

Loans, except for credit card loans, modified in a TDR are generally placed on
nonaccrual status, although in many cases such loans were already on
nonaccrual status prior to modification. These loans may be returned to
performing status (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following
criteria are met: (i) the borrower has performed under the modified terms for
a minimum of six months and/or six payments, and (ii) the Firm has an
expectation that repayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured based
on, for example, the borrower's debt capacity and level of future earnings,
collateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market considerations. In
certain limited and well-defined circumstances in which the loan is current at
the modification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual status at the
time of modification.

Loans modified in TDRs are generally measured for impairment using the Firm's
established asset-specific allowance methodology, which considers the expected
re-default rates for the modified loans. A loan modified in a TDR generally
remains subject to the asset-specific component of the allowance throughout
its remaining life, regardless of whether the loan is performing and has been
returned to accrual status. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion of the
methodology used to estimate the Firm's asset-specific allowance.

Foreclosed property

The Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan restructurings,
workouts, and foreclosures. Property acquired may include real property (e.g.,
residential real estate, land, and buildings) and commercial and personal
property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and ships).

The Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving assets in satisfaction
of a loan (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession). For loans
collateralized by real property, the Firm generally recognizes the asset
received at foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of
foreclosure transaction with the borrower. Foreclosed assets are reported in
other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets and initially recognized at
fair value less estimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of the
acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to the lower of cost
or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to fair value are charged/credited to
noninterest revenue. Operating expense, such as real estate taxes and
maintenance, are charged to other expense.

Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio

Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of scored
residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto and
business banking loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit
market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens,
prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain
payment-option loans that may result in negative amortization.

The following table provides information about retained consumer loans,
excluding credit card, by class.

| | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

Residential real estate| $| 237,561 | | $| 224,795 |

(a)At December 31, 2022 and 2021, included $350 million and $5.4 billion of
loans, respectively, in Business Banking under the PPP.

Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for consumer loans.
Loans that are more than 30 days past due provide an early warning of
borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be
unable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it
becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely to be unable or unwilling to
pay. In the case of residential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies
(greater than 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will
ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation transaction. In
addition to delinquency rates, other credit quality indicators for consumer
loans vary based on the class of loan, as follows:

•For residential real estate loans, the current estimated LTV ratio, or the
combined LTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the
potential loss severity in the event of default. Additionally, LTV or combined
LTV ratios can provide insight into a borrower's continued willingness to pay,
as the delinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for
loans where the borrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic
distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as to the credit
quality of the portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price
changes and specific events such as natural disasters, will affect credit
quality. The borrower's current or "refreshed" FICO score is a secondary
credit quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication
of the borrower's credit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a
low FICO score (less than 660) is considered to be of higher risk than a loan
to a borrower with a higher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a
high LTV ratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan
to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio and a high FICO score.

•For scored auto and business banking loans, geographic distribution is an
indicator of the credit performance of the portfolio. Similar to residential
real estate loans, geographic distribution provides insights into the
portfolio performance based on regional economic activity and events.

offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their
deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally
not considered delinquent.

(c)Excludes mortgage loans that are 30 or more days past due insured by U.S.
government agencies which were not material at December 31, 2022 and 2021.
These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.

(d)Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.

  

Approximately 37% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the
remaining balance are junior lien loans. The lien position the Firm holds is
considered in the Firm's allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that
have been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those
that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the
fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is
higher than the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within
the revolving period.

(a)Includes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are
charged down to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to
sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential
real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not
reaffirmed by the borrower ("Chapter 7 loans") as collateral-dependent
nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At December 31, 2022,
approximately 5% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or
more past due.

(b)Nonaccrual loans exclude mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies
which were not material at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

(c)Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance
with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered
collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or
the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value
of the underlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related
allowance may be negative.

(d)Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $175
million and $172 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively.

(e)Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

(f)Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the
estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a
minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized
home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent
available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current
estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all
available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.

(g)Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower's most recent credit score,
which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.

(h)Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that
did not have a refreshed FICO score. These loans have been included in a FICO
band based on management's estimation of the borrower's credit quality.

(i)Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.

(j)The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the
magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at December 31, 2022.

Loan modifications

Modifications of residential real estate loans, where the Firm grants
concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty are
generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term or other
insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs.
The carrying value of new TDRs was $362 million, $866 million and $819 million
for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There were
no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate
loans have been modified in TDRs.

  

  

  

  

  

Nature and extent of modifications

The Firm's proprietary modification programs as well as government programs,
including U.S. GSE programs, generally provide various concessions to
financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate
reductions, term or payment extensions and delays of principal and/or interest
payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the
original agreement. The following table provides information about how
residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs under the Firm's loss
mitigation programs described above during the periods presented. This table
excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of
debt and loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are
not considered concessions.

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults

The following table provides information about the financial effects of the
various concessions granted in modifications of residential real estate loans
under the loss mitigation programs described above and about redefaults of
certain loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented. The following table

default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred
within one year of the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent
the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such
loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment
default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments past
due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be
liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation
transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last twelve months may
not be representative of ultimate redefault levels.

At December 31, 2022, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of
residential real estate loans permanently modified in TDRs were six years. The
estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both
voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).

of the underlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related
allowance may be negative.

Loan modifications

Certain auto and other loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they
provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial
difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that
are not considered concessions are not TDRs.

The impact of these modifications, as well as new TDRs, were not material to
the Firm for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Additional
commitments to lend to borrowers whose loans have been modified in TDRs as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021 were not material.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Credit card loan portfolio

The credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and
purchased by the Firm. Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality
indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early warning that
borrowers may be experiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on
those borrowers that have been delinquent for a longer period of time (90 days
past due) is also considered. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic
distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the
portfolio based on the regional economy.

While the borrower's credit score is another general indicator of credit
quality, the Firm does not view credit scores as a primary indicator of credit
quality because the borrower's credit score tends to be a lagging indicator.
The

distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of credit quality
trends within the portfolio; however, the score does not capture all factors
that would be predictive of future credit performance. Refreshed FICO score
information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a statistically
significant random sample of the credit card portfolio is indicated in the
following table. FICO is considered to be the industry benchmark for credit
scores.

The Firm generally originates new credit card accounts to prime consumer
borrowers. However, certain cardholders' FICO scores may decrease over time,
depending on the performance of the cardholder and changes in the credit score
calculation.

The following tables provide information on delinquency, which is the primary
credit quality indicator for retained credit card loans.

Loan modifications

The Firm may offer loan modification programs granting concessions to credit
card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. The Firm grants
concessions for most of the credit card loans under long-term programs. These
modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan, generally
for 60 months, and typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit
card. Substantially all modifications under the Firm's long-term programs are
considered to be TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant
modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs.

If the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the
credit card loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged-off in
accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm
does not reinstate the borrower's line of credit.

  

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults

The following table provides information about the financial effects of the
concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for
the periods presented. For all periods disclosed, new enrollments were less

as of the end of the quarter in which they defaulted.

For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have
occurred when the borrower misses two consecutive contractual payments.
Defaulted modified credit card loans remain in the modification program and
continue to be charged off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off
policy.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Wholesale loan portfolio

Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large
corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals.

The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the internal risk
rating assigned to each loan. Risk ratings are used to identify the credit
quality of loans and differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings on
loans consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a loan will
default. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon
the default of the borrower and takes into consideration collateral and
structural support for each credit facility.

Management considers several factors to determine an appropriate internal risk
rating, including the obligor's debt capacity and financial flexibility, the
level of the obligor's earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the
level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the industry and
geography in which the obligor operates. The Firm's internal risk ratings
generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity
to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic
environment) defined by S&P and Moody's, however the quantitative
characteristics (e.g., PD and LGD) may differ as they reflect internal
historical experiences and assumptions. The Firm generally considers internal
ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as
investment grade, and these ratings have a lower PD and/or lower LGD than non-
investment grade ratings.

Noninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as noncriticized and
criticized, and the criticized portion is further subdivided into performing
and nonaccrual loans, representing management's assessment of the
collectibility of principal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher PD
than noncriticized loans. The Firm's definition of criticized aligns with the
U.S. banking regulatory definition of criticized exposures, which consist of
special mention, substandard and doubtful categories.

Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk
Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated information affecting the
obligor's ability to fulfill its obligations.

As noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the industry in which the
obligor conducts its operations. As part of the overall credit risk management
framework, the Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its
industry and client exposures, with particular attention paid to industries
with an actual or potential credit concern. Refer to Note 4 for further detail
on industry concentrations.

(b)Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis were not

Loan modifications

Certain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various
concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with
short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered
concessions are not TDRs nor are loans for which the Firm has elected to
suspend TDR accounting guidance under the option provided by the CARES Act.
New TDRs during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $801
million, $881 million and $734 million, respectively. New TDRs during the
years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 reflected the extension of
maturity dates, covenant waivers, receipt of assets in partial satisfaction of
the loan and deferral of principal and interest payments, predominantly in the
Commercial and Industrial and Other loan classes. The impact of these
modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to the Firm for the years
ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

The carrying value of TDRs was $936 million and $607 million as of December
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Note 13 - Allowance for credit losses

The Firm's allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of
expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's
financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses comprises:

•the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm's retained loan
portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the
Consolidated balance sheets,

•the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is presented on the
Consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable and other liabilities, and

•the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected
in investment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

The income statement effect of all changes in the allowance for credit losses
is recognized in the provision for credit losses.

Determining the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is complex
and requires significant judgment by management about the effect of matters
that are inherently uncertain. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit
losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm.
Subsequent evaluations of credit exposures, considering the macroeconomic
conditions, forecasts and other factors then prevailing, may result in
significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in future periods.

The Firm's policies used to determine its allowance for loan losses and its
allowance for lending-related commitments are described in the following
paragraphs. Refer to Note 10 for a description of the policies used to
determine the allowance for credit losses on investment securities.

Methodology for allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments

The allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-related commitments
represents expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of retained
loans and lending-related commitments that are not unconditionally
cancellable. The Firm does not record an allowance for future draws on
unconditionally cancellable lending-related commitments (e.g., credit cards).
Expected losses related to accrued interest on credit card loans are
considered in the Firm's allowance for loan losses. However, the Firm does not
record an allowance on other accrued interest receivables, due to its policy
to write these receivables off no later than 90 days past due by reversing
interest income.

The expected life of each instrument is determined by considering its
contractual term, expected prepayments, cancellation features, and certain
extension and call options. The expected life of funded credit card loans is
generally estimated by considering expected future payments on the credit card
account, and determining how much of those amounts should be allocated to
repayments of the funded loan balance (as of the balance sheet date)

versus other account activity. This allocation is made using an approach that
incorporates the payment application requirements of the Credit Card
Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, generally paying
down the highest interest rate balances first.

The estimate of expected credit losses includes expected recoveries of amounts
previously charged off or expected to be charged off, even if such recoveries
result in a negative allowance.

Collective and Individual Assessments

When calculating the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-
related commitments, the Firm assesses whether exposures share similar risk
characteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the Firm estimates
expected credit losses collectively, considering the risk associated with a
particular pool and the probability that the exposures within the pool will
deteriorate or default. The assessment of risk characteristics is subject to
significant management judgment. Emphasizing one characteristic over another
or considering additional characteristics could affect the allowance.

•Relevant risk characteristics for the consumer portfolio include product
type, delinquency status, current FICO scores, geographic distribution, and,
for collateralized loans, current LTV ratios.

•Relevant risk characteristics for the wholesale portfolio include risk
rating, delinquency status, tenor, level and type of collateral, LOB,
geography, industry, credit enhancement, product type, facility purpose, and
payment terms.

The majority of the Firm's credit exposures share risk characteristics with
other similar exposures, and as a result are collectively assessed for
impairment ("portfolio-based component"). The portfolio-based component covers
consumer loans, performing risk-rated loans and certain lending-related
commitments.

If an exposure does not share risk characteristics with other exposures, the
Firm generally estimates expected credit losses on an individual basis,
considering expected repayment and conditions impacting that individual
exposure ("asset-specific component"). The asset-specific component covers
modified PCD loans, loans modified or reasonably expected to be modified in a
TDR, collateral-dependent loans, as well as, risk-rated loans that have been
placed on nonaccrual status.

Portfolio-based component

The portfolio-based component begins with a quantitative calculation that
considers the likelihood of the borrower changing delinquency status or moving
from one risk rating to another. The quantitative calculation covers expected
credit losses over an instrument's expected life and is estimated by applying
credit loss factors to the Firm's estimated exposure at default. The credit
loss factors incorporate the probability of borrower default as well as loss
severity in the event of default. They are derived using

a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios over
an eight-quarter forecast period, followed by a single year straight-line
interpolation to revert to long run historical information for periods beyond
the eight-quarter forecast period. The five macroeconomic scenarios consist of
a central, relative adverse, extreme adverse, relative upside and extreme
upside scenario, and are updated by the Firm's central forecasting team. The
scenarios take into consideration the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, internal
perspectives from subject matter experts across the Firm, and market consensus
and involve a governed process that incorporates feedback from senior
management across LOBs, Corporate Finance and Risk Management.

The quantitative calculation is adjusted to take into consideration model
imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors
that are not yet reflected in the calculation. These adjustments are
accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss experience, including
during stressed periods, for each major product or model. Management applies
judgment in making this adjustment, including taking into account
uncertainties associated with the economic and political conditions, quality
of underwriting standards, borrower behavior, credit concentrations or
deterioration within an industry, product or portfolio, as well as other
relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the
portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships between these factors
create further uncertainties.

The application of different inputs into the quantitative calculation, and the
assumptions used by management to adjust the quantitative calculation, are
subject to significant management judgment, and emphasizing one input or
assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could
affect the estimate of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for
lending-related commitments.

Asset-specific component

To determine the asset-specific component of the allowance, collateral-
dependent loans (including those loans for which foreclosure is probable) and
larger, nonaccrual risk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio segment are
generally evaluated individually, while smaller loans (both scored and risk-
rated) are aggregated for evaluation using factors relevant for the respective
class of assets.

The Firm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as the difference
between the amortized cost of the loan and the present value of the cash flows
expected to be collected, discounted at the loan's original effective interest
rate. Subsequent changes in impairment are generally recognized as an
adjustment to the allowance for loan losses. For collateral-dependent loans,
the fair value of collateral less estimated costs to sell is used to determine
the charge-off amount for declines in value (to reduce the amortized cost of
the loan to the fair value of collateral) or the amount of negative allowance
that should be

recognized (for recoveries of prior charge-offs associated with improvements
in the fair value of collateral).

The asset-specific component of the allowance for loans that have been or are
expected to be modified in TDRs incorporates the effect of the modification on
the loan's expected cash flows (including forgone interest, principal
forgiveness, as well as other concessions), and also the potential for
redefault. For residential real estate loans modified in or expected to be
modified in TDRs, the Firm develops product-specific probability of default
estimates, which are applied at a loan level to compute expected losses. In
developing these probabilities of default, the Firm considers the relationship
between the credit quality characteristics of the underlying loans and certain
assumptions about housing prices and unemployment, based upon industry-wide
data. The Firm also considers its own historical loss experience to-date based
on actual redefaulted modified loans. For credit card loans modified in or
expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate projected
delinquencies and charge-offs based on the Firm's historical experience by
type of modification program. For wholesale loans modified or expected to be
modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate management's expectation of the
borrower's ability to repay under the modified terms.

Estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental as
these cash flow projections rely upon estimates such as loss severities, asset
valuations, default rates (including redefault rates on modified loans), the
amounts and timing of interest or principal payments (including any expected
prepayments) or other factors that are reflective of current and expected
market conditions. These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as
the duration of current overall economic conditions, industry, portfolio, or
borrower-specific factors, the expected outcome of insolvency proceedings as
well as, in certain circumstances, other economic factors. All of these
estimates and assumptions require significant management judgment and certain
assumptions are highly subjective.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Discussion of changes in the allowance

The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2022 was $22.2 billion,
reflecting a net addition of $3.5 billion from December 31, 2021, consisting
of:

•$2.3 billion in wholesale, driven by deterioration in the Firm's
macroeconomic outlook and loan growth, predominantly in CB and CIB, and

•$1.2 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting
higher outstanding balances and deterioration in the Firm's macroeconomic
outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a
decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of
the pandemic gradually recede.

Deterioration in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook included both updates to the
central scenario in the fourth quarter of 2022, which now reflects a mild
recession, as well as the impact of the increased weight placed on the adverse
scenarios beginning in the first quarter of 2022 due to the effects associated
with higher inflation, changes in monetary policy, and geopolitical risks,
including the war in Ukraine.

The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average
of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case
assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a weighted average U.S.
unemployment rate peaking at 5.6% in the second quarter of 2024, and a 1.2%
lower U.S. real GDP exiting the second quarter of 2024.

The Firm's central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S.
real GDP as follows:

Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates

will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future

periods.

Note 14 - Variable interest entities

Refer to Note 1 on page 164 for a further description of JPMorgan Chase's
accounting policies regarding consolidation of VIEs.

The following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored
VIEs by business segment. The Firm considers a "Firm-sponsored" VIE to include
any entity where: (1) JPMorgan Chase is the primary beneficiary of the
structure; (2) the VIE is used by JPMorgan Chase to securitize Firm assets;
(3) the VIE issues financial instruments with the JPMorgan Chase name; or (4)
the entity is a JPMorgan Chase-administered asset-backed commercial paper
conduit.

Municipal bond vehicles| Financing of municipal bond investments| pages
250-251  
  
The Firm's other business segments are also involved with VIEs (both third-
party and Firm-sponsored), but to a lesser extent, as follows:

•Asset & Wealth Management: AWM sponsors and manages certain funds that are
deemed VIEs. As asset manager of the funds, AWM earns a fee based on assets
managed; the fee varies with each fund's investment objective and is
competitively priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM's interests
are, in certain cases, considered to be significant variable interests that
result in consolidation of the financial results of these entities.

•Commercial Banking: CB provides financing and lending-related services to a
wide spectrum of clients, including certain third-party-sponsored entities
that may meet the definition of a VIE. CB does not control the activities of
these entities and does not consolidate these entities. CB's maximum loss
exposure, regardless of whether the entity is a VIE, is generally limited to
loans and lending-related commitments which are reported and disclosed in the
same manner as any other third-party transaction.

•Corporate: Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition
of VIEs; however these entities are generally subject to specialized
investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of
investments, including VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in
securities generally issued by third parties which may meet the definition of
VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In general, the Firm does not
have the power to direct the significant activities of these entities and
therefore does not consolidate these entities. Refer to Note 10 for further
information on the Firm's investment securities portfolio.

In addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing and other services to
VIEs sponsored by third parties. Refer to pages 251-252 of this Note for more
information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities as well as the VIEs
sponsored by third parties.

Significant Firm-sponsored variable interest entities

Credit card securitizations

CCB's Card Services business may securitize originated credit card loans,
primarily through the Chase Issuance Trust (the "Trust"). The Firm's
continuing involvement in credit card securitizations includes servicing the
receivables, retaining an undivided seller's interest in the receivables,
retaining certain senior and subordinated securities and maintaining escrow
accounts.

The Firm consolidates the assets and liabilities of its sponsored credit card
trusts as it is considered to be the primary beneficiary of these
securitization trusts based on the Firm's ability to direct the activities of
these VIEs through its servicing responsibilities and other duties, including
making decisions as to the receivables that are transferred into those trusts
and as to any related modifications and workouts. Additionally, the nature and
extent of the Firm's other continuing involvement with the

trusts, as indicated above, obligates the Firm to absorb losses and gives the
Firm the right to receive certain benefits from these VIEs that could
potentially be significant.

The underlying securitized credit card receivables and other assets of the
securitization trusts are available only for payment of the beneficial
interests issued by the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay
the Firm's other obligations or the claims of the Firm's creditors.

The agreements with the credit card securitization trusts require the Firm to
maintain a minimum undivided interest in the credit card trusts (generally
5%). As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Firm held undivided interests in
Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts of $6.1 billion and $7.1

receivables owned by those trusts of approximately 62% and 57% for the years
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Firm did not retain any
senior securities and retained $1.5 billion of subordinated securities in
certain of its credit card securitization trusts at both December 31, 2022 and
2021. The Firm's undivided interests in the credit card trusts and securities
retained are eliminated in consolidation.

Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts

The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential
mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB
and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the
respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans
and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.

The following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held
in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in
which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by
the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior
interests or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held
pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements,
and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm's only continuing
involvement is servicing the loans. The Firm's maximum loss exposure from
retained and purchased interests is the carrying value of these interests.

Residential mortgage

The Firm securitizes residential mortgage loans originated by CCB, as well as
residential mortgage loans purchased from third parties by either CCB or CIB.
CCB generally retains servicing for all residential mortgage loans it
originated or purchased, and for certain mortgage loans purchased by CIB. For
securitizations of loans serviced by CCB, the Firm has the power to direct the
significant activities of the VIE because it is responsible for decisions
related to loan modifications and workouts. CCB may also retain an interest
upon securitization.

In addition, CIB engages in underwriting and trading activities involving
securities issued by Firm-sponsored securitization trusts. As a result, CIB at
times retains senior and/or subordinated interests (including residual
interests and amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention
rules) in residential mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization,
and/or reacquires positions in the secondary market in the normal course of
business. In certain instances, as a result of the positions retained or
reacquired by CIB or held by Treasury and CIO or CCB, when considered together
with the servicing arrangements entered into by CCB, the Firm is deemed to be
the primary beneficiary of certain securitization trusts.

The Firm does not consolidate residential mortgage securitizations (Firm-
sponsored or third-party-sponsored) when it is not the servicer (and therefore
does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the
trust) or does not hold a beneficial interest in the trust that could
potentially be significant to the trust.

Commercial mortgages and other consumer securitizations

CIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in
underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by
securitization trusts. CIB may retain unsold senior and/or subordinated
interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk
retention rules) in commercial mortgage securitizations at the time of
securitization but, generally, the Firm does not service commercial loan
securitizations. Treasury and CIO may choose to invest in these
securitizations as well. For commercial mortgage securitizations the power to
direct the significant activities of the VIE generally is held by the servicer
or investors in a specified class of securities ("controlling class"). The
Firm generally does not retain an interest in the controlling class in its
sponsored commercial mortgage securitization transactions.

Re-securitizations

The Firm engages in certain re-securitization transactions in which debt
securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests.
These transfers occur in connection with both U.S. GSEs and government agency
sponsored VIEs, which are backed by residential mortgages. The Firm's
consolidation analysis is largely dependent on the Firm's role and interest in
the re-securitization trusts.

The following table presents the principal amount of securities transferred to
re-securitization VIEs.

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

Transfers of securities to VIEs

| | | | |  
U.S. GSEs and government agencies| $| 16,128 | | | $| 53,923 | | | $| 46,123 |  
  
Most re-securitizations with which the Firm is involved are client-driven
transactions in which a specific client or group of clients is seeking a
specific return or risk profile. For these transactions, the Firm has
concluded that the decision-making power of the entity is shared between the
Firm and its clients, considering the joint effort and decisions in
establishing the re-securitization trust and its assets, as well as the
significant economic interest the client holds in the re-securitization trust;
therefore the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.

The Firm did not transfer any private label securities to re-securitization
VIEs during 2022, 2021 and 2020, and retained interests in any such Firm-
sponsored VIEs as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were not material.

Additionally, the Firm may invest in beneficial interests of third-party-
sponsored re-securitizations and generally purchases these interests in the
secondary market. In these circumstances, the Firm does not have the
unilateral ability to direct the most significant activities of the re-
securitization trust, either because it was not involved in the initial design
of the trust, or the Firm was involved with an independent third-party sponsor
and demonstrated shared power over the creation of the trust; therefore, the
Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.

and government agency re-securitization VIEs or any Firm-sponsored private-
label re-securitization VIEs.

Multi-seller conduits

Multi-seller conduit entities are separate bankruptcy remote entities that
provide secured financing, collateralized by pools of receivables and other
financial assets, to customers of the Firm. The conduits fund their financing
facilities through the issuance of highly rated commercial paper. The primary
source of repayment of the commercial paper is the cash flows from the pools
of assets. In most instances, the assets are structured with deal-specific
credit enhancements provided to the conduits by the customers (i.e., sellers)
or other third parties. Deal-specific credit enhancements are generally
structured to cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the pool of
assets, and are typically in the form of overcollateralization provided by the
seller. The deal-specific credit enhancements mitigate the Firm's potential
losses on its agreements with the conduits.

To ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper, and to provide the
conduits with funding to provide financing to customers in the event that the
conduits do not obtain funding in the commercial paper market, each asset pool
financed by the conduits has a minimum 100% deal-specific liquidity facility
associated with it provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. also provides the multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted program-
wide liquidity facilities and program-wide credit enhancement in the form of
standby letters of credit. The amount of program-wide credit enhancement
required is based upon commercial paper issuance and approximates 10% of the
outstanding balance of commercial paper.

The Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as the Firm
has both the power to direct the significant activities of the conduits and a
potentially significant economic interest in the conduits. As administrative
agent and in its role in structuring transactions, the Firm makes decisions
regarding asset types and credit quality, and manages the commercial paper
funding needs of the conduits. The Firm's interests that could potentially be
significant to the VIEs include the fees received as administrative agent and
liquidity and program-wide credit enhancement provider, as well as the
potential exposure created by the liquidity and credit enhancement facilities
provided to the conduits.

In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests
in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The
Firm held $13.8 billion and $13.7 billion of the commercial paper issued by
the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm's
investments reflect the Firm's funding needs and capacity and were not driven
by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to
credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to
purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller
conduits.

Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit
enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The
Firm or the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related
commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.
The unfunded commitments were $10.6 billion and $13.4 billion at December 31,
2022 and 2021, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-
related commitments in other unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to
Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.

Municipal bond vehicles

Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond ("TOB") trusts allow
institutions to finance their municipal bond investments at short-term rates.
In a typical TOB transaction, the trust purchases highly rated municipal
bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by issuing two types of
securities: (1) puttable floating-rate certificates ("floaters") and (2)
inverse floating-rate residual interests ("residuals"). The floaters are
typically purchased by money market funds or other short-term investors and
may be tendered, with requisite notice, to the TOB trust. The residuals are
retained by the investor seeking to finance its municipal bond investment. TOB
transactions where the residual is held by a third-party investor are
typically known as customer TOB trusts, and non-customer TOB trusts are
transactions where the Residual is retained by the Firm. Customer TOB trusts
are sponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-
customer TOB transactions. The Firm may provide various services to a TOB
trust, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider,
and/or sponsor.

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC may serve as a remarketing agent on the floaters
for TOB trusts. The remarketing agent is responsible for establishing the
periodic variable rate on the floaters, conducting the initial placement and
remarketing tendered floaters. The remarketing agent may, but is not obligated
to, make markets in floaters. Floaters held by the Firm were not material
during 2022 and 2021.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC often serves as the
sole liquidity or tender option provider for the TOB trusts. The liquidity
provider's obligation to perform is conditional and is limited by certain
events

| | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
  
250

| |

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

("Termination Events"), which include bankruptcy or failure to pay by the
municipal bond issuer or credit enhancement provider, an event of taxability
on the municipal bonds or the immediate downgrade of the municipal bond to
below investment grade. In addition, the liquidity provider's exposure is
typically further limited by the high credit quality of the underlying
municipal bonds, the excess collateralization in the vehicle, or, in certain
transactions, the reimbursement agreements with the Residual holders.

Holders of the floaters may "put," or tender, their floaters to the TOB trust.
If the remarketing agent cannot successfully remarket the floaters to another
investor, the

liquidity provider either provides a loan to the TOB trust for the TOB trust's
purchase of the floaters, or it directly purchases the tendered floaters.

TOB trusts are considered to be variable interest entities. The Firm
consolidates non-customer TOB trusts because as the Residual holder, the Firm
has the right to make decisions that significantly impact the economic
performance of the municipal bond vehicle, and it has the right to receive
benefits and bear losses that could potentially be significant to the
municipal bond vehicle.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

VIEs sponsored by third parties

The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These
include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider,
investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or
custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm's-length, and individual
credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into
consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not
have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly
impact the VIE's economic performance, or a variable interest that could
potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE,
but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets
in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any
other third-party transaction.

Tax credit vehicles

The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are
limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable
housing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered
VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing member and
has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and
accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm
generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a
return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects.
The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding
commitments, was $30.2 billion and $26.8 billion, of which $10.6 billion and
$9.4 billion was unfunded at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The
Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold
varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax
credits. Refer to Note 25 for further information on affordable housing tax
credits and Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related
commitments.

Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts)

The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts, including
remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer
TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a
reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon
the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party
Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to
protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying
municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the
Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the
economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle.

The Firm's maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at
December 31, 2022 and 2021, was $5.8 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively.
The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was
$8.2 billion and $10.5 billion respectively.

  

Loan securitizations

The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential
mortgages, credit card receivables, commercial mortgages and other consumer
loans. The purposes of these securitization transactions were to satisfy
investor demand and to generate liquidity for the Firm.

For loan securitizations in which the Firm is not required to consolidate the
trust, the Firm records the transfer of the loan receivable to the trust as a
sale when all of the following accounting criteria for a sale are met: (1) the
transferred financial assets are legally isolated from the Firm's creditors;
(2) the transferee or beneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the
transferred financial assets; and (3) the Firm does not maintain effective
control over the transferred financial assets (e.g., the Firm cannot
repurchase the transferred assets before their maturity and it does not have
the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return the transferred
assets).

For loan securitizations accounted for as a sale, the Firm recognizes a gain
or loss based on the difference between the value of proceeds received
(including cash, beneficial interests, or servicing assets received) and the
carrying value of the assets sold. Gains and losses on securitizations are
reported in noninterest revenue.

In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables
above, the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and
purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse
basis, predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold
primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide
certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm
also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae
guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S.
government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles
underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a
limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the
credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note
28 for additional information about the Firm's loan sales- and securitization-
related indemnifications and Note 15 for additional information about the
impact of the Firm's sale of certain excess MSRs.

Options to repurchase delinquent loans

In addition to the Firm's obligation to repurchase certain loans due to
material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 28,
the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services
for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under
certain arrangements. The Firm typically

elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it
continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance
with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or
guaranteed. When the Firm's repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans
must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a
corresponding liability. Refer to Note 12 for additional information.

The following table presents loans the Firm repurchased or had an option to
repurchase, real estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed
residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm's Consolidated balance

Note 15 - Goodwill and Mortgage servicing rights

Goodwill

Goodwill is recorded upon completion of a business combination as the
difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets
acquired, and can be adjusted up to one year from the acquisition date as more
information is obtained about the fair value of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is not
amortized but is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of each
fiscal year, or more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes
in the business climate, indicate that there may be an impairment.

The goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the
related reporting units, which are generally determined based on how the
Firm's businesses are managed and how they are reviewed. The following table
presents goodwill attributed to the reportable business segments and
Corporate.

Goodwill impairment testing

The Firm's goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

The goodwill impairment test is generally performed by comparing the current
fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value
is in excess of the carrying value, then the reporting unit's goodwill is
considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than the carrying
value, then an impairment charge is recognized

for the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair
value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.

The Firm uses the reporting units' allocated capital plus goodwill and other
intangible assets as a proxy for the carrying values of equity for the
reporting units in the goodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit equity is
determined on a similar basis as the allocation of capital to the LOBs which
takes into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of
similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. Proposed
LOB capital levels are incorporated into the Firm's annual budget process,
which is reviewed by the Firm's Board of Directors and Operating Committee.
Allocated capital is further reviewed at least annually and updated as needed.

The primary method the Firm uses to estimate the fair value of its reporting
units is the income approach. This approach projects cash flows for the
forecast period and uses the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal
values. These cash flows and terminal values, which are based on the reporting
units' annual budgets and forecasts are then discounted using an appropriate
discount rate. The discount rate used for each reporting unit represents an
estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit and is determined
considering the Firm's overall estimated cost of equity (estimated using the
Capital Asset Pricing Model), as adjusted for the risk characteristics
specific to each reporting unit (for example, for higher levels of risk or
uncertainty associated with the business or management's forecasts and
assumptions). To assess the reasonableness of the discount rates used for each
reporting unit, management compares the discount rate to the estimated cost of
equity for publicly traded institutions with similar businesses and risk
characteristics. In addition, the weighted average cost of equity (aggregating
the various reporting units) is compared with the Firm's overall estimated
cost of equity to ensure reasonableness. The valuations derived from the
discounted cash flow analysis are then compared with market-based trading and
transaction multiples for relevant competitors. Trading and transaction
comparables are used as general indicators to assess the overall
reasonableness of the estimated fair values, although precise conclusions
generally cannot be drawn due to the differences that naturally exist between
the Firm's businesses and competitor institutions.

The Firm also takes into consideration a comparison between the aggregate fair
values of the Firm's reporting units and JPMorgan Chase's market
capitalization. In evaluating this comparison, the Firm considers several
factors, including (i) a control premium that would exist in a market
transaction, (ii) factors related to the level of execution risk that would
exist at the Firmwide level that do not exist at the reporting unit level and
(iii) short-term market volatility and other factors that do not directly
affect the value of individual reporting units.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses,
increases in capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or
market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in
the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of
the Firm's reporting units to decline in the future, which could result in a
material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some
portion of the associated goodwill.

Mortgage servicing rights

MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing
servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future
servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the
loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are
received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing
and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or
recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is
retained.

As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to account for its MSRs at
fair value. The Firm treats its MSRs as a single class of servicing assets
based on the availability of market inputs used to measure the fair value of
its MSR asset and its treatment of MSRs as one aggregate pool for risk
management purposes. The Firm estimates the fair value of MSRs using an
option-adjusted spread ("OAS") model, which projects MSR cash flows over
multiple interest rate scenarios in conjunction with the Firm's prepayment
model, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. The model
considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees,
prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late charges and
other ancillary revenue, and other economic factors. The Firm compares fair
value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available, and
also considers recent market activity and actual portfolio experience.

The fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, including
their effect on prepayment speeds. MSRs typically decrease in value when
interest rates decline because declining interest rates tend to increase
prepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the net servicing cash
flows that comprise the MSR asset. Conversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-
backed securities), and certain derivatives (e.g., those for which the Firm

receives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value when interest rates
decline. JPMorgan Chase uses combinations of derivatives and securities to
manage the risk of changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is to offset
any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of MSRs with changes in
the fair value of the related risk management instruments.

The following table summarizes MSR activity for the years ended December 31,
2022, 2021 and 2020.

advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior
to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right
to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the
advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if
they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.

Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be
easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions
to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be
linear. In the following table, the effect that a change in a particular
assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other
assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in
another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial
change.

The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the
fair value of the Firm's MSRs at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and outlines the

Note 16 - Premises and equipment

Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost
less accumulated depreciation and amortization. JPMorgan Chase computes
depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of
an asset. For leasehold improvements, the Firm uses the straight-line method
computed over the lesser of the remainder of the lease term, or estimated
useful life of the improvements.

JPMorgan Chase capitalizes certain costs associated with the acquisition or
development of internal-use software. Once the software is ready for its
intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
software's expected useful life.

Impairment is assessed periodically when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable.

Note 18 - Leases

Firm as lessee

At December 31, 2022, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries were obligated under
a number of noncancellable leases, predominantly operating leases for premises
and equipment used primarily for business purposes. These leases generally
have terms of 20 years or less, determined based on the contractual maturity
of the lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or terminate
the lease when the Firm is reasonably certain that it will exercise those
options. All leases with lease terms greater than twelve months are reported
as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use ("ROU") asset. None of
these lease agreements impose restrictions on the Firm's ability to pay
dividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or enter into
further lease agreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation clauses
that will increase rental payments based on maintenance, utility and tax
increases, which are non-lease components. The Firm elected not to separate
lease and non-lease components of a contract for its real estate leases. As
such, real estate lease payments represent payments on both lease and non-
lease components.

Operating lease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at the lease
commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease
payments over the lease term. The future lease payments are discounted at a
rate that estimates the Firm's collateralized borrowing rate for financing
instruments of a similar term and are included in accounts payable and other
liabilities. The operating lease ROU asset, included in premises and
equipment, also includes any lease prepayments made, plus initial direct costs
incurred, less any lease incentives received. Rental expense associated with
operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term,
and generally included in occupancy expense in the Consolidated statements of
income.

The following tables provide information related to the Firm's operating
leases:

Firm as lessor

The Firm provides auto and equipment lease financing to its customers through
lease arrangements with lease terms that may contain renewal, termination
and/or purchase options. The Firm's lease financings are predominantly auto
operating leases. These assets subject to operating leases are recognized in
other assets on the Firm's Consolidated balance sheets and are depreciated on
a straight-line basis over the lease term to reduce the asset to its estimated
residual value. Depreciation expense is included in technology, communications
and equipment expense in the Consolidated statements of income. The Firm's
lease income is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease
term and is included in other income in the Consolidated statements of income.

On a periodic basis, the Firm assesses leased assets for impairment, and if
the carrying amount of the leased asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows
from the lease payments and the estimated residual value upon disposition of
the leased asset, an impairment loss is recognized.

The risk of loss on auto and equipment leased assets relating to the residual
value of the leased assets is monitored through projections of the asset
residual values at lease origination and periodic review of residual values,
and is mitigated through arrangements with certain manufacturers or lessees.

The following table presents the carrying value of assets subject to leases
reported on the Consolidated balance sheets:

Notes to consolidated financial statements

The weighted-average contractual interest rates for total long-term debt
excluding structured notes accounted for at fair value were 3.26% and 2.67% as
of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In order to modify exposure to
interest rate and currency exchange rate movements, JPMorgan Chase utilizes
derivative instruments, primarily interest rate and cross-currency interest
rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt issuances. The use of these
instruments modifies the Firm's interest expense on the associated debt. The
modified weighted-average interest rates for total long-term debt, including
the effects of related derivative instruments, were 4.89% and 1.43% as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. has guaranteed certain long-term debt of its
subsidiaries, including structured notes. These guarantees rank on parity with
the Firm's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The amount of such
guaranteed long-term debt and structured notes was $28.2 billion and $16.4
billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The Firm's unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an
acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the
existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require
additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm's credit
ratings, financial ratios, earnings or stock price.

Note 22 - Common stock

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, JPMorgan Chase was authorized to issue 9.0
billion shares of common stock with a par value of $1 per share.

Common shares issued (reissuances from treasury) by JPMorgan Chase during the
years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows.

Outstanding at December 31| 2,934.2 | | 2,944.1 | | 3,049.4 |  
  
Effective May 1, 2022, the Firm is authorized to purchase up to $30 billion of
common shares under its common share repurchase program, which superseded the
previously approved repurchase program under which the Firm was authorized to
purchase up to $30 billion of common shares. In the second half of 2022, as a
result of the expected increases in regulatory capital requirements, the Firm
temporarily suspended share repurchases. In the first quarter of 2023, the
Firm resumed repurchasing shares under its common share repurchase program.

The following table sets forth the Firm's repurchases of common stock for the
years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

18,448 | | | $| 6,397 |  
| | | | | |  
| | | | | |  
  
(a)As directed by the Federal Reserve, total net repurchases and common stock
dividends in the first and second quarter of 2021 were restricted and could
not exceed the average of the Firm's net income for the four preceding
calendar quarters. Effective July 1, 2021, the Firm became subject to the
normal capital distribution restrictions provided under the regulatory capital
framework.

(b)On March 15, 2020, in response to the economic disruptions caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended repurchases of its common
stock. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large banks, including
the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases through the end of 2020.

The Board of Directors' authorization to repurchase common shares is utilized
at management's discretion, and the timing of purchases and the exact amount
of common shares that may be repurchased is subject to various factors,
including market conditions; legal and regulatory considerations affecting the
amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm's capital position (taking
into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and
alternative investment opportunities. The $30 billion common share repurchase
program approved by the Board does not establish specific price targets or
timetables. The repurchase program may be suspended by management at any time;
and may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated
transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans, which are written trading plans
that the Firm may enter into from time to time under Rule 10b5-1 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and which allow the Firm to repurchase its
common shares during periods when it may otherwise not be repurchasing common
shares -- for example, during internal trading blackout periods.

As of December 31, 2022, approximately 58.9 million shares of common stock
were reserved for issuance under various employee incentive, compensation,
option and stock purchase plans, and directors' compensation plans.

Note 23 - Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is calculated using the two-class method.
Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are
allocated to common stock and participating securities. JPMorgan Chase grants
RSUs under its share-based compensation programs, predominantly all of which
entitle recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting
period on a basis equivalent to dividends paid to holders of the Firm's common
stock. These unvested RSUs meet the definition of participating securities
based on their respective rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, and they
are treated as a separate class of securities in computing basic EPS.
Participating securities are not included as incremental shares in computing
diluted EPS; refer to Note 9 for additional information.

Diluted EPS incorporates the potential impact of contingently issuable shares,
including awards which require future service as a condition of delivery of
the underlying common stock. Diluted EPS is calculated under both the two-
class and treasury stock methods, and the more dilutive amount is reported.
For each of the periods presented in the table below, diluted EPS calculated
under the two-class method was more dilutive.

The following table presents the calculation of net income applicable to
common stockholders and basic and diluted EPS for the years ended December 31,
2022, 2021 and 2020.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Note 25 - Income taxes

JPMorgan Chase and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal
income tax return. JPMorgan Chase uses the asset and liability method to
provide for income taxes on all transactions recorded in the Consolidated
Financial Statements. This method requires that income taxes reflect the
expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes. Accordingly, a
deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference is determined
based on the tax rates that the Firm expects to be in effect when the
underlying items of income and expense are realized. JPMorgan Chase's expense
for income taxes includes the current and deferred portions of that expense. A
valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount
the Firm expects to realize.

Due to the inherent complexities arising from the nature of the Firm's
businesses, and from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial
number of jurisdictions, significant judgments and estimates are required to
be made. Agreement of tax liabilities between JPMorgan Chase and the many tax
jurisdictions in which the Firm files tax returns may not be finalized for
several years. Thus, the Firm's final tax-related assets and liabilities may
ultimately be different from those currently reported.

Effective tax rate and expense

The following table presents a reconciliation of the applicable statutory U.S.
federal income tax rate to the effective tax rate.

Total income tax expense includes $331 million of tax benefits in 2022, $69
million of tax expenses in 2021, and $72 million of tax benefits in 2020,
resulting from the resolution of tax audits.

Tax effect of items recorded in stockholders' equity

The preceding table does not reflect the tax effect of certain items that are
recorded each period directly in stockholders' equity. The tax effect of all
items recorded directly to stockholders' equity resulted in a decrease of $4.5
billion in 2022, an increase of $2.0 billion in 2021, and a decrease of $827
million in 2020.

The Firm will recognize any U.S. income tax expense it may incur on global
intangible low tax income as income tax expense in the period in which the tax
is incurred. At December 31, 2022 the income tax expense incurred was not
material.

Affordable housing tax credits

The Firm recognized $1.8 billion of tax credits and other tax benefits
associated with investments in affordable housing projects within income tax
expense for the year ended 2022, and $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion for the
years ended 2021 and 2020, respectively. The amount of amortization of such
investments reported in income tax expense was $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion and
$1.2 billion, respectively. The carrying value of these investments, which are
reported in other assets on the Firm's Consolidated balance sheets, was $12.1
billion and $10.8 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The
amount of commitments related to these investments, which are reported in
accounts payable and other liabilities on the Firm's Consolidated balance
sheets, was $5.4 billion and $4.6 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively.

Deferred taxes

Deferred income tax expense/(benefit) results from differences between assets
and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax
return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management's
judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. If a
deferred tax asset is determined to be unrealizable, a valuation allowance is
established. The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities
are reflected in the following table.

JPMorgan Chase has recorded deferred tax assets of $365 million at December
31, 2022, in connection with U.S. federal and non-U.S. NOL carryforwards and
other tax attributes, FTC carryforwards, and state and local capital loss
carryforwards. At December 31, 2022, total U.S. federal NOL carryforwards were
$648 million, non-U.S. NOL carryforwards were $308 million, FTC carryforwards
were $81 million, state and local capital loss carryforwards were $1.0
billion, and other U.S. federal tax attributes were $256 million. If not
utilized, a portion of the U.S. federal NOL carryforwards and other U.S.
federal tax attributes will expire between 2026 and 2037 whereas others have
an unlimited carryforward period. Similarly, certain non-U.S. NOL
carryforwards will expire between 2026 and 2039 whereas others have an
unlimited carryforward period. The FTC carryforwards will expire between 2029
and 2030, and the state and local capital loss carryforwards will expire in
2026.

The valuation allowance at December 31, 2022, was due to the state and local
capital loss carryforwards, FTC carryforwards, and certain non-U.S. deferred
tax assets, including NOL carryforwards.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Unrecognized tax benefits

At December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, JPMorgan Chase's unrecognized tax
benefits, excluding related interest expense and penalties, were $5.0 billion,
$4.6 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, of which $3.8 billion, $3.4
billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, if recognized, would reduce the annual
effective tax rate. Included in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits are
certain items that would not affect the effective tax rate if they were
recognized in the Consolidated statements of income. These unrecognized items
include the tax effect of certain temporary differences, the portion of gross
state and local unrecognized tax benefits that would be offset by the benefit
from associated U.S. federal income tax deductions, and the portion of gross
non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefits that would have offsets in other
jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase evaluates the need for changes in unrecognized
tax benefits based on its anticipated tax return filing positions as part of
its U.S. federal and state and local tax returns. In addition, the Firm is
presently under audit by a number of taxing authorities, most notably by the
Internal Revenue Service, as summarized in the Tax examination status table
below. The evaluation of unrecognized tax benefits as well as the potential
for audit settlements make it reasonably possible that over the next 12 months
the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease by as
much as approximately $1.0 billion. The change in the unrecognized tax benefit
would result in a payment or income statement recognition.

The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending
amount of unrecognized tax benefits.

After-tax interest expense/(benefit) and penalties related to income tax
liabilities recognized in income tax expense were $141 million, $174 million
and $147 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, in addition to the liability for unrecognized
tax benefits, the Firm had accrued $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion,
respectively, for income tax-related interest and penalties.

Tax examination status

JPMorgan Chase is continually under examination by the Internal Revenue
Service, by taxing authorities throughout the world, and by many state and
local jurisdictions throughout the U.S. The following table summarizes the
status of significant income tax examinations of JPMorgan Chase and its
consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022.

Note 26 - Restricted cash, other restricted

assets and intercompany funds transfers

Restricted cash and other restricted assets

Certain of the Firm's cash and other assets are restricted as to withdrawal or
usage. These restrictions are imposed by various regulatory authorities based
on the particular activities of the Firm's subsidiaries.

The business of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to examination and
regulation by the OCC. The Bank is a member of the U.S. Federal Reserve
System, and its deposits in the U.S. are insured by the FDIC, subject to
applicable limits.

The Firm is required to maintain cash reserves at certain non-US central
banks.

The Firm is also subject to rules and regulations established by other U.S.
and non U.S. regulators. As part of its compliance with the respective
regulatory requirements, the Firm's broker-dealer activities are subject to
certain restrictions on cash and other assets.

The following table presents the components of the Firm's restricted cash:

| | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
December 31, (in billions)| 2022| 2021  
  
Segregated for the benefit of securities and cleared derivative customers

| 18.7 | | 14.6 |  
  
Cash reserves at non-U.S. central banks and held for other general purposes

| 8.1 | | 5.1 |  
  
Total restricted cash(a)

| $| 26.8 | | $| 19.7 |  
  
(a)Comprises $25.4 billion and $18.4 billion in deposits with banks, and $1.4
billion and $1.3 billion in cash and due from banks on the Consolidated
balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Also, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Firm had the following other
restricted assets:

•Cash and securities pledged with clearing organizations for the benefit of
customers of $42.4 billion and $47.5 billion, respectively.

•Securities with a fair value of $31.7 billion and $30.0 billion,
respectively, were also restricted in relation to customer activity.

Intercompany funds transfers

Restrictions imposed by U.S. federal law prohibit JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
and its subsidiaries, from lending to JPMorgan Chase & Co. ("Parent Company")
and certain of its affiliates unless the loans are secured in specified
amounts. Such secured loans provided by any banking subsidiary to the Parent
Company or to any particular affiliate, together with certain other
transactions with such affiliate (collectively referred to as "covered
transactions"), must be made on terms and conditions that are consistent with
safe and sound banking practices. In addition, unless collateralized with cash
or US Government debt obligations, covered transactions are generally limited
to 10% of the banking subsidiary's total capital, as determined by the risk-
based capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of covered transactions between
any banking subsidiary and all of its affiliates is limited to 20% of the
banking subsidiary's total capital.

The Parent Company's two principal subsidiaries are JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
and JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC, an intermediate holding company (the "IHC").
The IHC generally holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase's subsidiaries other than
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets
and provides intercompany loans to the Parent Company. The Parent Company is
obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received
from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt
securities and of preferred and common stock).

The principal sources of income and funding for the Parent Company are
dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and extensions of
credit from the IHC. In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in
statutes and regulations, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have
authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to
limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise,
including the Parent Company and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank
holding companies, if, in the banking regulator's opinion, payment of a
dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the
financial condition of the banking organization. The IHC is prohibited from
paying dividends or extending credit to the Parent Company if certain capital
or liquidity "thresholds" are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by
the Parent Company's management or Board of Directors.

At January 1, 2023, the Parent Company's banking subsidiaries could pay, in
the aggregate, approximately $34 billion in dividends to their respective bank
holding companies without the prior approval of their relevant banking
regulators. The capacity to pay dividends in 2023 will be supplemented by the
banking subsidiaries' earnings during the year.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Note 27 - Regulatory capital

The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-
capitalized requirements, for the consolidated financial holding company. The
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") establishes similar minimum
capital requirements and standards for the Firm's principal IDI subsidiary,
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall
capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. bank
holding companies and banks, including the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries,
including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Two comprehensive approaches are
prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach ("Basel III
Standardized"), and an advanced approach ("Basel III Advanced"). For each of
the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or
Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio
requirements.

The three components of regulatory capital under the Basel III rules are as
illustrated below:

![jpm-20221231_g13.jpg](jpm-20221231_g13.jpg)

Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines of the Federal
Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1
capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure
to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take
action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to these capital requirements
established by their respective primary regulators.

The following table presents the risk-based regulatory capital ratio
requirements and well-capitalized ratios to which the Firm and its IDI
subsidiaries were subject as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Firm. The CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratio requirements each include a
respective minimum requirement plus a GSIB surcharge of 3.5% as calculated
under Method 2; plus a 4.0% SCB for Basel III Standardized ratios and a fixed
2.5% capital conservation buffer for Basel III Advanced ratios. The
countercyclical buffer is currently set to 0% by the federal banking agencies.

(b)For the period ended December 31, 2021, the CET1, Tier 1, and Total capital
ratio requirements under Basel III Standardized applicable to the Firm were
11.2%, 12.7% and 14.7%, respectively. SCB for Basel III Standardized ratio for
2021 was 3.2%.

(c)Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chase's IDI subsidiaries. The CET1,
Tier 1 and Total capital ratio requirements include a fixed capital
conservation buffer requirement of 2.5% that is applicable to the IDI
subsidiaries. The IDI subsidiaries are not subject to the GSIB surcharge.

(d)Represents requirements for bank holding companies pursuant to regulations
issued by the Federal Reserve.

(e)Represents requirements for IDI subsidiaries pursuant to regulations issued
under the FDIC Improvement Act.

CECL regulatory capital transition

Until December 31, 2021, the Firm's capital reflected a two year delay of the
effects of CECL provided by the Federal Reserve Board in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Beginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL capital benefit is being
phased out at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of December 31, 2022,
the Firm's CET1 capital reflected the remaining $2.2 billion benefit
associated with the CECL capital transition provisions.

Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm phased out 25% of the other
CECL capital transition provisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted
average assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as applicable.

Refer to Note 1 for further information on the CECL accounting guidance.

The following tables present risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel
III Standardized and Basel III Advanced approaches and leverage-based capital
metrics for JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. As of December 31,
2022 and 2021, JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were well-
capitalized and met all capital requirements to which each was subject.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Note 28 - Off-balance sheet lending-related

financial instruments, guarantees, and

other commitments

JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g.,
commitments and guarantees) to address the financing needs of its customers
and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents
the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client
draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation
under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to
perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and
guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired
without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual
amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm's view, representative of its
expected future credit exposure or funding requirements.

To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer
lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related
commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 13 for further information regarding
the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following
table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance
sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments
at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The amounts in the table below for credit card
and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available
credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not
anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be
utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of
credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law,
without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when
the borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs
when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property,
or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the
borrower.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of commitments
for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to
support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that
those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well as committed
liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues
commitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several
forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.

Guarantees

U.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a
guarantee, a liability in an amount equal to the fair value of the obligation
undertaken in issuing the guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a
contract that contingently requires the guarantor to pay a guaranteed party
based upon: (a) changes in an underlying asset, liability or equity security
of the guaranteed party; or (b) a third party's failure to perform under a
specified agreement. The Firm considers the following off-balance sheet
arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and
other financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain
indemnification agreements included within third-party contractual
arrangements, certain derivative contracts and the guarantees under the
sponsored member repo program.

As required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records guarantees at the
inception date fair value of the non-contingent obligation assumed (e.g., the
amount of consideration received or the net present value of the premium
receivable). For these obligations, the Firm records this fair value amount in
other liabilities with an offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums
received),

or other assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium receivable recorded in
other assets is reduced as cash is received under the contract, and the fair
value of the liability recorded at inception is amortized into income as
lending and deposit-related fees over the life of the guarantee contract. The
lending-related contingent obligation is recognized based on expected credit
losses in addition to, and separate from, any non-contingent obligation.

Non-lending-related contingent obligations are recognized when the liability
becomes probable and reasonably estimable. These obligations are not
recognized if the estimated amount is less than the carrying amount of any
non-contingent liability recognized at inception (adjusted for any
amortization). Examples of non-lending-related contingent obligations include
indemnifications provided in sales agreements, where a portion of the sale
proceeds is allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain or loss that
would otherwise result from the transaction. For these indemnifications, the
initial liability is amortized to income as the Firm's risk is reduced (i.e.,
over time or when the indemnification expires).

The contractual amount and carrying value of guarantees and indemnifications
are included in the table on page 277.

For additional information on the guarantees, see below.

Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees

Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional
lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a
client or customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as
commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade
financings and similar transactions.

The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of
standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees and other letters of
credit arrangements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Securities lending indemnifications

Through the Firm's securities lending program, counterparties' securities, via
custodial and non-custodial arrangements, may be lent to third parties. As
part of this program, the Firm provides an indemnification in the lending
agreements which protects the lender against the failure of the borrower to
return the lent securities. To minimize its liability under these
indemnification agreements, the Firm obtains cash or other highly liquid
collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the value of the securities
on loan from the borrower. Collateral is marked to market daily to help assure
that collateralization is adequate. Additional collateral is called from the
borrower if a shortfall exists, or collateral may be released to the borrower
in the event of overcollateralization. If a borrower defaults, the Firm would
use the collateral held to purchase replacement securities in the market or to
credit the lending client or counterparty with the cash equivalent thereof.

The cash collateral held by the Firm may be invested on behalf of the client
in indemnified resale agreements, whereby the Firm indemnifies the client
against the loss of principal invested. To minimize its liability under these
agreements, the Firm obtains collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of
the principal invested.

Derivatives qualifying as guarantees

The Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have the
characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. These contracts include
written put options that require the Firm to purchase assets upon exercise by
the option holder at a specified price by a specified date in the future. The
Firm may enter into written put option contracts in order to meet client
needs, or for other trading purposes. The terms of written put options are
typically five years or less.

Derivatives deemed to be guarantees also includes stable value contracts,
commonly referred to as "stable value products", that require the Firm to make
a payment of the difference between the market value and the book value of a
counterparty's reference portfolio of assets in the event that market value is
less than book value and certain other conditions have been met. Stable value
products are transacted in order to allow investors to realize investment
returns with less volatility than an unprotected portfolio. These contracts
are typically longer-term or may have no stated maturity, but allow the Firm
to elect to terminate the contract under certain conditions.

The notional value of derivative guarantees generally represents the Firm's
maximum exposure. However, exposure to certain stable value products is
contractually limited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional
amount.

The fair value of derivative guarantees reflects the probability, in the
Firm's view, of whether the Firm will be required to perform under the
contract. The Firm reduces exposures to these contracts by entering into
offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the market
risk related to the derivative guarantees.

  

The following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as guarantees as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021.

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a
guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the
credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of credit
derivatives.

Unsettled securities financing agreements

In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into resale and securities
borrowed agreements. At settlement, these commitments result in the Firm
advancing cash to and receiving securities collateral from the counterparty.
The Firm also enters into repurchase and securities loaned agreements. At
settlement, these commitments result in the Firm receiving cash from and
providing securities collateral to the counterparty. Such agreements settle at
a future date. These agreements generally do not meet the definition of a
derivative, and therefore, are not recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets
until settlement date. These agreements predominantly have regular-way
settlement terms. Refer to Note 11 for a further discussion of securities
financing agreements.

Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications

Mortgage repurchase liability

In connection with the Firm's mortgage loan sale and securitization activities
with U.S. GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans
sold meet certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase
mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such representations and
warranties are breached by the Firm.

Private label securitizations

The liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label
securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its
litigation reserves.

Refer to Note 30 for additional information regarding litigation.

Loans sold with recourse

The Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain commercial lending
products on both a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing,
the principal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing
advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). In recourse servicing,
the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans,
such as Fannie Mae

Notes to consolidated financial statements

or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse
servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property
underlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding principal
balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding and
disposing of the underlying property. The Firm's securitizations are
predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future
credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by the
trust. The unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse as well as the
carrying value of the related liability that the Firm has recorded in accounts
payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, which is
representative of the Firm's view of the likelihood it will have to perform
under its recourse obligations, are disclosed in the table on page 277.

Other off-balance sheet arrangements

Indemnification agreements - general

In connection with issuing securities to investors outside the U.S., the Firm
may agree to pay additional amounts to the holders of the securities in the
event that, due to a change in tax law, certain types of withholding taxes are
imposed on payments on the securities. The terms of the securities may also
give the Firm the right to redeem the securities if such additional amounts
are payable. The Firm may also enter into indemnification clauses in
connection with the licensing of software to clients ("software licensees") or
when it sells a business or assets to a third party ("third-party
purchasers"), pursuant to which it indemnifies software licensees for claims
of liability or damages that may occur subsequent to the licensing of the
software, or third-party purchasers for losses they may incur due to actions
taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the business or assets. It is difficult
to estimate the Firm's maximum exposure under these indemnification
arrangements, since this would require an assessment of future changes in tax
law and future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet
occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk
of loss to be remote.

Merchant charge-backs

Under the rules of payment networks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the
Firm's Merchant Services business in CIB Payments, retains a contingent
liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that
result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the
cardholder's favor, the Firm will (through the cardholder's issuing bank)
credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the
transaction to the merchant. If the Firm is unable to collect the amount from
the merchant, the Firm will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded
to the cardholder. The Firm mitigates this risk by withholding future
settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In
addition, the Firm recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or
performance risk related to charge-backs.

For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Firm processed an
aggregate volume of $2,158.4 billion, $1,886.7 billion, and $1,597.3 billion,
respectively.

Clearing Services - Client Credit Risk

The Firm provides clearing services for clients by entering into securities
purchases and sales and derivative contracts with CCPs, including ETDs such as
futures and options, as well as OTC-cleared derivative contracts. As a
clearing member, the Firm stands behind the performance of its clients,
collects cash and securities collateral (margin) as well as any settlement
amounts due from or to clients, and remits them to the relevant CCP or client
in whole or part. There are two types of margin: variation margin is posted on
a daily basis based on the value of clients' derivative contracts and initial
margin is posted at inception of a derivative contract, generally on the basis
of the potential changes in the variation margin requirement for the contract.

As a clearing member, the Firm is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its
clients, but is not liable to clients for the performance of the CCPs. Where
possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its risk to the client through the
collection of appropriate amounts of margin at inception and throughout the
life of the transactions. The Firm can also cease providing clearing services
if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement. In
the event of nonperformance by a client, the Firm would close out the client's
positions and access available margin. The CCP would utilize any margin it
holds to make itself whole, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid
by the Firm as a clearing member.

The Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk of the client through
the recognition of margin receivables from clients and margin payables to
CCPs; the clients' underlying securities or derivative contracts are not
reflected in the Firm's Consolidated Financial Statements.

It is difficult to estimate the Firm's maximum possible exposure through its
role as a clearing member, as this would require an assessment of transactions
that clients may execute in the future. However, based upon historical
experience, and the credit risk mitigants available to the Firm, management
believes it is unlikely that the Firm will have to make any material payments
under these arrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be remote.

Refer to Note 5 for information on the derivatives that the Firm executes for
its own account and records in its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Exchange & Clearing House Memberships

The Firm is a member of several securities and derivative exchanges and
clearing houses, both in the U.S. and other countries, and it provides
clearing services to its clients. Membership in some of these organizations
requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the
organization as a result of the default of another member. Such obligations
vary with different organizations. These obligations may be limited to the
amount (or a multiple of the amount) of the Firm's contribution to the
guarantee fund maintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of the
resources available to cover any losses in the event of a member default.
Alternatively, these obligations may also include a pro rata share of the
residual losses after applying the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain
clearing houses require the Firm as a member to pay a pro rata share of losses
that may result from the clearing house's investment of guarantee fund
contributions and initial margin, unrelated to and independent of the default
of another member. Generally a payment would only be required should such
losses exceed the resources of the clearing house or exchange that are
contractually required to absorb the losses in the first instance. In certain
cases, it is difficult to estimate the Firm's maximum possible exposure under
these membership agreements, since this would require an assessment of future
claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However,
based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to the
Firm to be remote. Where the Firm's maximum possible exposure can be
estimated, the amount is disclosed in the table on page 277, in the Exchange &
clearing house guarantees and commitments line.

Sponsored member repo program

The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight and term
resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of
the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation ("FICC") on behalf of clients that
become sponsored members under the FICC's rules. The Firm also guarantees to
the FICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored member
clients' respective obligations under the FICC's rules. The Firm minimizes its
liability under these guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash
or high-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing
house; therefore, the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm's
maximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated
collateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and
commitments line on page 277. Refer to Note 11 for additional information on
credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of
collateral pledged under repurchase agreements.

Guarantees of subsidiaries

In the normal course of business, the Parent Company may provide
counterparties with guarantees of certain of the trading and other obligations
of its subsidiaries on a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the
Firm's

counterparties. The obligations of the subsidiaries are included on the Firm's
Consolidated balance sheets or are reflected as off-balance sheet commitments;
therefore, the Parent Company has not recognized a separate liability for
these guarantees. The Firm believes that the occurrence of any event that
would trigger payments by the Parent Company under these guarantees is remote.

The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes
of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC ("JPMFC"),
a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and no other subsidiary of
the parent company guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which rank
on a parity with the Firm's unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are not
included in the table on page 277 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 for
additional information.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Note 29 - Pledged assets and collateral

Pledged assets

The Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to maintain potential borrowing
capacity at discount windows with Federal Reserve banks, various other central
banks and FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm pledges assets for other purposes,
including to collateralize repurchase and other securities financing
agreements, to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative contracts and
deposits. Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or repledged or
otherwise used by the secured parties and are parenthetically identified on
the Consolidated balance sheets as assets pledged.

The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that it is permitted to sell
or repledge, deliver or otherwise use. This collateral is generally obtained
under resale and other securities financing agreements, prime brokerage-
related held-for-investment customer receivables and derivative contracts.
Collateral is generally used under repurchase and other securities financing
agreements, to cover short sales, and to collateralize derivative contracts
and deposits.

Note 30 - Litigation

Contingencies

As of December 31, 2022, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are
defendants or respondents in numerous legal proceedings, including private,
civil litigations, government investigations or regulatory enforcement
matters. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single
plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members.
Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and
informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory
organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication,
arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm's lines of business
and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law
tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer
protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories.

The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible
losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from
$0 to approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 2022. This estimated
aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information
available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes
that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters,
the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date.
The Firm's estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses
involves significant judgment, given:

•the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact
that many are in preliminary stages,

•the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the
Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined,

•the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including
issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and

•the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings,
including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the
court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse
parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be
incorrect.

In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the
Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the
likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm's estimate of
the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to
time, and actual losses may vary significantly.

Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm's material legal proceedings.

1MDB Litigation. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil
litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad
("1MDB"), a Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. J.P. Morgan
(Suisse) SA was served in August 2022. The claim alleges "dishonest
assistance" against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of $300
million and $500 million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB
and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan Suisse (SA) held by 1MDB PetroSaudi
Limited, a joint venture company between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman)
Limited. In September 2022, the Firm filed an application challenging the
validity of service and the Malaysian court's jurisdiction to hear the claim.

Amrapali. India's Enforcement Directorate ("ED") is investigating J.P. Morgan
India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by
two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into
residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group ("Amrapali"). In
2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims against Amrapali, including
petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure
to deliver residential units. The home buyers' petitions have been overseen by
the Supreme Court of India and are ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an
order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $31.5 million.
The Firm is appealing the order and the fine. Relatedly, in July 2019, the
Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that
Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and
the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain
currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordering the ED to
conduct a further inquiry under India's Prevention of Money Laundering Act
("PMLA") and Foreign Exchange Management Act ("FEMA"). In May 2020, the ED
attached approximately $25 million from J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in
connection with the criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and
cooperating with the PMLA investigation.

Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an
escrow and depository account for the Federal Government of Nigeria ("FGN")
and two major international oil companies. The account held approximately $1.1
billion in connection with a dispute among the clients over rights to an oil
field. Following the settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid
out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in accordance with directions
received from its clients. In November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria
("FRN") commenced a claim in the English High Court for approximately $875
million in payments made out of the accounts. The FRN alleged that the
payments were

Notes to consolidated financial statements

instructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
but that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on notice that the
payments may be fraudulent. A trial was held between February and April 2022.
In June 2022, the Court decided the case in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
and dismissed it in full. In November 2022, the Court refused permission to
the FRN to appeal the dismissal, and the matter was concluded.

Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported
settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign
exchange ("FX") sales and trading activities and controls related to those
activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a
single violation of federal antitrust law. The Department of Labor ("DOL")
granted the Firm exemptions that permit the Firm and its affiliates to
continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA") through the ten-year
disqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-
related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter
which is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal.

With respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to
the Firm's settlement of a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based
plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws
based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also
sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options
on futures. Although certain members of the settlement class filed requests to
the Court to be excluded from the class, an agreement to resolve their claims
was reached in December 2022. A putative class action remains pending against
the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who
purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates. In addition, some
FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged
underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K.,
Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. An agreement to resolve one of
the UK actions was reached in December 2022. In a putative class action
pending before the U.K. Competition Appeal Tribunal, proposed class
representatives have appealed the tribunal's denial of a request for class
certification on an opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement in principle has
been reached in the putative class action, which remains subject to court
approval.

Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a
series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well
as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card
interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In
2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, but that
settlement was reversed on

appeal and remanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of New York.

The original class action was divided into two separate actions, one seeking
primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief.
In September 2018, the parties to the monetary class action finalized an
agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant
to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional $900
million to the approximately $5.3 billion previously held in escrow from the
original settlement. In December 2019, the amended settlement agreement was
approved by the District Court. Certain merchants appealed the District
Court's approval order, and those appeals are pending. Based on the percentage
of merchants that opted out of the amended class settlement, $700 million has
been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with
the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action continues separately,
and in September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs' motion for class
certification in part, and denied the motion in part.

Of the merchants who opted out of the amended damages class settlement,
certain merchants filed individual actions raising similar allegations against
Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks. While some
of those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with
the merchants who opted out representing over half of the combined Mastercard-
branded and Visa-branded payment card sales volume.

Jeffrey Epstein Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is named as a defendant
in two lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York which allege that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. knowingly
facilitated Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking and other unlawful conduct by
providing banking services to Epstein until 2013. One case, which was filed in
November 2022, is a putative class action filed by an alleged sex-trafficking
victim of Epstein, and the other case, which was filed in December 2022, was
brought on behalf of the government of the United States Virgin Islands and
also alleges certain Virgin Islands statutory claims. JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. has moved to dismiss both complaints.

LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase
has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities
around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association's
("BBA") London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") for various currencies and the
European Banking Federation's Euro Interbank Offered Rate ("EURIBOR"). The
Swiss Competition Commission's investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the
Firm and one other bank remain subject, continues. In December 2016, the
European Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding
an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has
filed an appeal of that

284

| |

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending.

In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in
various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates,
including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during
the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained
dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others
are in various stages of litigation. The United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York has granted class certification of antitrust
claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the
defendants, including the Firm. A consolidated putative class action related
to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE Benchmark
Administration has been dismissed. In addition, a group of individual
plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm
and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar
LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans
and credit cards. In September 2022, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint
in its entirety, and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting similar
antitrust claims, which defendants have moved to dismiss. The Firm's
settlements of putative class actions related to the Singapore Interbank
Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill
Swap Reference Rate received final court approval in November 2022, while the
settlement related to Swiss franc LIBOR remains subject to court approval.

Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic
Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action
filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York
State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the
emergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions.
Defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. Plaintiffs have moved
to certify a class in this action, which defendants are opposing.

Shareholder Litigation. Several shareholder putative class actions, as well as
shareholder derivative actions purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have
been filed against the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current
and former officers.

Certain of these shareholder suits relate to historical trading practices by
former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and
related conduct which were the subject of the Firm's resolutions with the DOJ,
CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary activities that were separately
the subject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in
November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits was filed in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York in May 2022, asserting breach of
fiduciary duty and unjust

enrichment claims relating to the historical trading practices and related
conduct and fiduciary activities which were the subject of the resolutions
described above. In December 2022, the court granted defendants' motion to
dismiss this action in full. A second shareholder derivative action was filed
in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in
December 2022 relating to the historical trading practices and related
conduct, which asserts breach of fiduciary duty and contribution claims and
alleges that the shareholder is excused from making a demand to commence
litigation because such a demand would have been futile. In addition, a
consolidated putative class action is pending in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of New York on behalf of shareholders who
acquired shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock during the putative class
period, alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or
misleading because they did not disclose certain information relating to the
historical trading practices and conduct. Defendants have moved to dismiss the
amended complaint in this action.

A separate shareholder derivative suit was filed in March 2022 in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting breaches
of fiduciary duty and violations of federal securities laws based on the
alleged failure of the Board of Directors to exercise adequate oversight over
the Firm's compliance with records preservation requirements which were the
subject of resolutions between certain of the Firm's subsidiaries and the SEC
and the CFTC. Defendants' motion to dismiss the amended complaint is pending.

* * *

In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase
and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a
substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has
meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently
outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously.
Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future.

The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently
outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP
for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it
is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss
can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal
proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes
adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on
management's best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm's legal
expense was $266 million, $426 million and $1.1 billion for the years ended
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There is no assurance that the
Firm's litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal
proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate
damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large
number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state
with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending
matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses,
fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase
believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with
counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and
after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated
aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently
pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm's
consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of
the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the
ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the
reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material
reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may
be material to JPMorgan Chase's operating results for a particular period,
depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed
and the level of JPMorgan Chase's income for that period.

Note 31 - International operations

The following table presents income statement and balance sheet-related
information for JPMorgan Chase by major international geographic area. The
Firm defines international activities for purposes of this footnote
presentation as business transactions that involve clients residing outside of
the U.S., and the information presented below is based predominantly on the
domicile of the client, the location from which the client relationship is
managed, booking location or the location of the trading desk. However, many
of the Firm's U.S. operations serve international businesses.

  

As the Firm's operations are highly integrated, estimates and subjective
assumptions have been made to apportion revenue and expense between U.S. and
international operations. These estimates and assumptions are consistent with
the allocations used for the Firm's segment reporting as set forth in Note 32.

The Firm's long-lived assets for the periods presented are not considered by
management to be significant in relation to total assets. The majority of the
Firm's long-lived assets are located in the U.S.

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business
segments - Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank,
Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a
Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products

Segment results

The following table provides a summary of the Firm's segment results as of or
for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, on a managed basis. The
Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results
and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the
Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis.
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt
securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to
taxable investments and securities. This allows management to assess the
comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-
exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt
items is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments have
no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.

Capital allocation

Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration a
variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and
applicable regulatory capital requirements. ROE is measured and internal
targets for expected returns are established as key measures of a business
segment's performance.

The Firm's allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA,
Basel III Advanced RWA, the GSIB surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a
severe stress environment. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and
methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the
capital allocated to the LOBs may change.

Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and rates

Provided below is a summary of JPMorgan Chase's consolidated average balances,
interest and rates on a taxable-equivalent basis for the years 2020 through

the Consolidated statements of income, adjusted to present interest income and
rates earned on

assets exempt from income taxes (i.e., federal taxes) on a basis comparable
with other taxable investments. The incremental tax rate used for calculating
the taxable-equivalent adjustment was approximately 24% in 2022, 2021 and
2020.

Changes in net interest income, volume and rate analysis

  

The table below presents an attribution of net interest income between volume
and rate. The attribution between volume and rate is calculated using annual
average balances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in the
table and the corresponding annual rates (refer to pages 292-296 for more
information on average balances and rates). In this analysis, when the change
cannot be isolated to either volume or rate, it has been allocated to volume.
The annual rates include the impact of changes in market rates, as well as the
impact of any change in composition of the various products within each
category of asset or liability. This analysis is calculated separately for
each category without consideration of the relationship between categories
(for example, the net spread between the rates earned on assets and the rates
paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result, changes in the
granularity or groupings considered in this analysis would produce a different
attribution result, and due to the complexities involved, precise allocation
of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is inherently complex
and judgmental.

Credit derivatives: Financial instruments whose value is derived from the
credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference
entity) which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk
to another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence of a credit
event by the reference entity, which may include, among other events, the
bankruptcy or failure to pay its obligations, or certain restructurings of the
debt of the reference entity, neither party has recourse to the reference
entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the
difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value at
the time of settling the credit derivative contract. The determination as to
whether a credit event has occurred is generally made by the relevant
International Swaps and Derivatives Association ("ISDA") Determinations
Committee.

LTV: "Loan-to-value": For residential real estate loans, the relationship,
expressed as a percentage, between the principal amount of a loan and the
appraised value of the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the
loan.

Origination date LTV ratio

The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination date LTV ratios
are calculated based on the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-
level data) at the origination date.

Current estimated LTV ratio

An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios
are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally
recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area
("MSA") level. These MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to
the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available.
As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do
not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the
resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed
as estimates.

Combined LTV ratio

The LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well as unused
lines, related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien
home equity products.

Macro businesses: the macro businesses include Rates, Currencies and Emerging

Mortgage origination channels:

Retail - Borrowers who buy or refinance a home through direct contact with a
mortgage banker employed by the Firm using a branch office, the Internet or by
phone. Borrowers are frequently referred to a mortgage banker by a banker in a
Chase branch, real estate brokers, home builders or other third parties.

Correspondent - Banks, thrifts, other mortgage banks and other financial
institutions that sell closed loans to the Firm.

Mortgage product types:

Alt-A

Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but
have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional
prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the
following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans
secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above
normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm's Alt-A loans are those
where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets
or the amount or source of his or her income.

Option ARMs

The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-rate mortgage loan
that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully
amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option
ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period.
This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate.
The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once
the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the
loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect
movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover
interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and
added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to
payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing
loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.

Prime

Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet
specific underwriting

requirements, including prescriptive requirements related to income and
overall debt levels. New prime mortgage borrowers provide full documentation
and generally have reliable payment histories.

Subprime

Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were offered to certain
customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not
limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of
greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high
debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the
borrower's primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late
payments on the loan.

•Reward costs: The cost to the Firm for points earned by cardholders enrolled
in credit card rewards programs generally tied to sales transactions.

•Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card partners based on the cost
of loyalty program rewards earned by cardholders on credit card transactions.

Net mortgage servicing revenue: Includes operating revenue earned from
servicing third-party mortgage loans, which is recognized over the period in
which the service is provided; changes in the fair value of MSRs; the impact
of risk management activities associated with MSRs; and gains and losses on
securitization of excess mortgage servicing. Net mortgage servicing revenue
also includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value
adjustments of certain repurchased loans insured by U.S. government agencies.

Net revenue rate: Represents Card Services net revenue (annualized) expressed
as a percentage of average loans for the period.

the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced
approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-
sensitive

approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and
