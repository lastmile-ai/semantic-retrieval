GENERAL

Embracing Our Future

Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and
every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local
opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. We are
creating the platforms and tools, powered by artificial intelligence ("AI"),
that deliver better, faster, and more effective solutions to support small and
large business competitiveness, improve educational and health outcomes, grow
public-sector efficiency, and empower human ingenuity. From infrastructure and
data, to business applications and collaboration, we provide unique,
differentiated value to customers.

In a world of increasing economic complexity, AI has the power to
revolutionize many types of work. Microsoft is now innovating and expanding
our portfolio with AI capabilities to help people and organizations overcome
today's challenges and emerge stronger. Customers are looking to unlock value
from their digital spend and innovate for this next generation of AI, while
simplifying security and management. Those leveraging the Microsoft Cloud are
best positioned to take advantage of technological advancements and drive
innovation. Our investment in AI spans the entire company, from Microsoft
Teams and Outlook, to Bing and Xbox, and we are infusing generative AI
capability into our consumer and commercial offerings to deliver copilot
capability for all services across the Microsoft Cloud.

We're committed to making the promise of AI real - and doing it responsibly.
Our work is guided by a core set of principles: fairness, reliability and
safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability.

What We Offer

Founded in 1975, we develop and support software, services, devices, and
solutions that deliver new value for customers and help people and businesses
realize their full potential.

We offer an array of services, including cloud-based solutions that provide
customers with software, services, platforms, and content, and we provide
solution support and consulting services. We also deliver relevant online
advertising to a global audience.

Our products include operating systems, cross-device productivity and
collaboration applications, server applications, business solution
applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools,
and video games. We also design and sell devices, including PCs, tablets,
gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related
accessories.

The Ambitions That Drive Us

To achieve our vision, our research and development efforts focus on three
interconnected ambitions:

•

Reinvent productivity and business processes.

•

Build the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge platform.

•

Create more personal computing.

Reinvent Productivity and Business Processes

At Microsoft, we provide technology and resources to help our customers create
a secure, productive work environment. Our family of products plays a key role
in the ways the world works, learns, and connects.

* * *

PART I

Item 1

Our growth depends on securely delivering continuous innovation and advancing
our leading productivity and collaboration tools and services, including
Office 365, Dynamics 365, and LinkedIn. Microsoft 365 brings together Office
365, Windows, and Enterprise Mobility + Security to help organizations empower
their employees with AI-backed tools that unlock creativity, increase
collaboration, and fuel innovation, all the while enabling compliance coverage
and data protection. Microsoft Teams is a comprehensive platform for work,
with meetings, calls, chat, collaboration, and business process automation.
Microsoft Viva is an employee experience platform that brings together
communications, knowledge, learning, resources, and insights. Microsoft 365
Copilot combines next-generation AI with business data in the Microsoft Graph
and Microsoft 365 applications.

Together with the Microsoft Cloud, Dynamics 365, Microsoft Teams, and our AI
offerings bring a new era of collaborative applications that optimize business
functions, processes, and applications to better serve customers and employees
while creating more business value. Microsoft Power Platform is helping domain
experts drive productivity gains with low-code/no-code tools, robotic process
automation, virtual agents, and business intelligence. In a dynamic labor
market, LinkedIn is helping professionals use the platform to connect, learn,
grow, and get hired.

Build the Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge Platform

As digital transformation and adoption of AI accelerates and revolutionizes
more business workstreams, organizations in every sector across the globe can
address challenges that will have a fundamental impact on their success. For
enterprises, digital technology empowers employees, optimizes operations,
engages customers, and in some cases, changes the very core of products and
services. We continue to invest in high performance and sustainable computing
to meet the growing demand for fast access to Microsoft services provided by
our network of cloud computing infrastructure and datacenters.

Our cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: datacenters that
deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than
smaller ones; datacenters that coordinate and aggregate diverse customer,
geographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of
computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy locations that
lower application maintenance labor costs.

The Microsoft Cloud provides the best integration across the technology stack
while offering openness, improving time to value, reducing costs, and
increasing agility. Being a global-scale cloud, Azure uniquely offers hybrid
consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted security and
compliance. We see more emerging use cases and needs for compute and security
at the edge and are accelerating our innovation across the spectrum of
intelligent edge devices, from Internet of Things ("IoT") sensors to gateway
devices and edge hardware to build, manage, and secure edge workloads.

Our AI platform, Azure AI, is helping organizations transform, bringing
intelligence and insights to the hands of their employees and customers to
solve their most pressing challenges. Organizations large and small are
deploying Azure AI solutions to achieve more at scale, more easily, with the
proper enterprise-level and responsible AI protections.

We have a long-term partnership with OpenAI, a leading AI research and
deployment company. We deploy OpenAI's models across our consumer and
enterprise products. As OpenAI's exclusive cloud provider, Azure powers all of
OpenAI's workloads. We have also increased our investments in the development
and deployment of specialized supercomputing systems to accelerate OpenAI's
research.

Our hybrid infrastructure offers integrated, end-to-end security, compliance,
identity, and management capabilities to support the real-world needs and
evolving regulatory requirements of commercial customers and enterprises. Our
industry clouds bring together capabilities across the entire Microsoft Cloud,
along with industry-specific customizations. Azure Arc simplifies governance
and management by delivering a consistent multi-cloud and on-premises
management platform.

Nuance, a leader in conversational AI and ambient intelligence across
industries including healthcare, financial services, retail, and
telecommunications, joined Microsoft in 2022. Microsoft and Nuance enable
organizations to accelerate their business goals with security-focused, cloud-
based solutions infused with AI.

We are accelerating our development of mixed reality solutions with new Azure
services and devices. Microsoft Mesh enables organizations to create custom,
immersive experiences for the workplace to help bring remote and hybrid
workers and teams together.

PART I

Item 1

The ability to convert data into AI drives our competitive advantage. The
Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform is a leading cloud data platform that
fully integrates databases, analytics, and governance. The platform empowers
organizations to invest more time creating value rather than integrating and
managing their data. Microsoft Fabric is an end-to-end, unified analytics
platform that brings together all the data and analytics tools that
organizations need.

GitHub Copilot is at the forefront of AI-powered software development, giving
developers a new tool to write code easier and faster so they can focus on
more creative problem-solving. From GitHub to Visual Studio, we provide a
developer tool chain for everyone, no matter the technical experience, across
all platforms, whether Azure, Windows, or any other cloud or client platform.

Windows also plays a critical role in fueling our cloud business with Windows
365, a desktop operating system that's also a cloud service. From another
internet-connected device, including Android or macOS devices, users can run
Windows 365, just like a virtual machine.

Additionally, we are extending our infrastructure beyond the planet, bringing
cloud computing to space. Azure Orbital is a fully managed ground station as a
service for fast downlinking of data.

Create More Personal Computing

We strive to make computing more personal, enabling users to interact with
technology in more intuitive, engaging, and dynamic ways.

Windows 11 offers innovations focused on enhancing productivity, including
Windows Copilot with centralized AI assistance and Dev Home to help developers
become more productive. Windows 11 security and privacy features include
operating system security, application security, and user and identity
security.

Through our Search, News, Mapping, and Browser services, Microsoft delivers
unique trust, privacy, and safety features. In February 2023, we launched an
all new, AI-powered Microsoft Edge browser and Bing search engine with Bing
Chat to deliver better search, more complete answers, and the ability to
generate content. Microsoft Edge is our fast and secure browser that helps
protect users' data. Quick access to AI-powered tools, apps, and more within
Microsoft Edge's sidebar enhance browsing capabilities.

We are committed to designing and marketing first-party devices to help drive
innovation, create new device categories, and stimulate demand in the Windows
ecosystem. The Surface family includes Surface Pro, Surface Laptop, and other
Surface products.

Microsoft continues to invest in gaming content, community, and cloud
services. We have broadened our approach to how we think about gaming end-to-
end, from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played,
including subscription services like Xbox Game Pass and new devices from
third-party manufacturers so players can engage across PC, console, and
mobile. In January 2022, we announced plans to acquire Activision Blizzard,
Inc., a leader in game development and an interactive entertainment content
publisher.

Our Future Opportunity

We are focused on helping customers use the breadth and depth of the Microsoft
Cloud to get the most value out of their digital spend while leading the new
AI wave across our solution areas. We continue to develop complete,
intelligent solutions for our customers that empower people to be productive
and collaborate, while safeguarding businesses and simplifying IT management.
Our goal is to lead the industry in several distinct areas of technology over
the long term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are
investing significant resources in:

•

Transforming the workplace to deliver new modern, modular business
applications, drive deeper insights, and improve how people communicate,
collaborate, learn, work, and interact with one another.

•

Building and running cloud-based services in ways that utilize ubiquitous
computing to unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and
individuals.

•

Applying AI and ambient intelligence to drive insights, revolutionize many
types of work, and provide substantive productivity gains using natural
methods of communication.

PART I

Item 1

•

Tackling security from all angles with our integrated, end-to-end solutions
spanning security, compliance, identity, and management, across all clouds and
platforms.

•

Inventing new gaming experiences that bring people together around their
shared love for games on any devices and pushing the boundaries of innovation
with console and PC gaming.

•

Using Windows to fuel our cloud business, grow our share of the PC market, and
drive increased engagement with our services like Microsoft 365 Consumer,
Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Edge, Bing, Xbox Game Pass, and more.

Our future growth depends on our ability to transcend current product category
definitions, business models, and sales motions.

Corporate Social Responsibility

Commitment to Sustainability

Microsoft's approach to addressing climate change starts with the
sustainability of our own business. In 2020, we committed to being a carbon
negative, water positive, and zero waste company by 2030.

In May 2023, we released our Environmental Sustainability Report which looked
back at our progress during fiscal year 2022. We continued to make progress on
our goals, with our overall emissions declining by 0.5 percent. While our
Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions continued to decline, Scope 3 emissions
increased by 0.5 percent. Scope 3 represented 96 percent of our total
emissions, resulting primarily from the operations of our suppliers and the
use of our products across our customers.

A few examples of our continued progress include:

•

Signed new power purchase agreements, bringing our total portfolio of carbon-
free energy to over 13.5 gigawatts.

•

Contracted for water replenishment projects that are estimated to provide more
than 15.6 million cubic meters in volumetric water benefit over the lifetime
of these projects.

•

Diverted 12,159 metric tons of solid waste from landfills and incinerators
across our direct operational footprint.

•

Protected 12,270 acres of land in Belize - more than the 11,206 acres of land
that we use around the world.

Microsoft has a role to play in developing and advancing new climate
solutions, but we recognize that no solution can be offered by any single
company, organization, or government. Our approach helps to support the
sustainability needs of our customers and the global community. Our Microsoft
Cloud for Sustainability, an environmental sustainability management platform
that includes Microsoft Sustainability Manager, enables organizations to
record, report, and reduce their Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. These digital
tools can interoperate with business systems and unify data intelligence for
organizations.

Addressing Racial Injustice and Inequity

We are committed to addressing racial injustice and inequity in the United
States for Black and African American communities and helping improve lived
experiences at Microsoft, in employees' communities, and beyond. Our Racial
Equity Initiative focuses on three multi-year pillars, each containing actions
and progress we expect to make or exceed by 2025.

•

Strengthening our communities: using data, technology, and partnerships to
help improve the lives of Black and African American people in the United
States, including our employees and their communities.

•

Engaging our ecosystem: using our balance sheet and relationships with
suppliers and partners to foster societal change and create new opportunities.

•

Increasing representation and strengthening inclusion: building on our
momentum by adding a $150 million investment to strengthen inclusion and
double the number of Black, African American, Hispanic, and Latinx leaders in
the United States by 2025.

* * *

PART I

Item 1

In fiscal year 2023, we collaborated with partners and worked within
neighborhoods and communities to launch and scale a number of projects and
programs, including:

•

Working with 103 unique organizations in 165 cities and counties on our
Justice Reform Initiative to empower communities and advance racial equity and
fairness in the justice system.

•

Increasing access to affordable broadband, devices, and digital literacy
training across 14 geographies, including 11 cities and three states in the
Black Rural south.

•

Growing our Nonprofit Tech Acceleration for Black and African American
Communities program, which uses data, technology, and partnerships to help
more than 2,000 local organizations to modernize and streamline operations.

•

Expanding our Technology Education and Learning Support ("TEALS") program to
reach nearly 400 high schools in 21 communities to increase computer science
opportunities for Black and African American students.

We exceeded our 2020 goal to double the percentage of our transaction volumes
with Black- and African American-owned financial institutions by 2023. We are
also increasing investment activity with Black- and African American-owned
asset managers, which now represent 45 percent of our external manager group,
enabling increased funds into local communities. We also met our goal of
creating a $100 million program focused on mission-driven banks. We enriched
our supplier pipeline, achieving our goal to spend $500 million with double
the number of Black- and African American-owned suppliers. We also increased
the number of identified partners in the Black Partner Growth Initiative by
more than 250 percent, surpassing our initial goal.

We have made meaningful progress on representation and inclusion at Microsoft.
As of June 2023, we are 93 percent of the way to our 2025 commitment to double
the number of Black and African American people managers in the U.S. (below
director level), and 107 percent of the way for Black and African American
directors (people managers and individual contributors). We are 28 percent of
the way for Hispanic and Latinx people managers (below director level) and 74
percent of the way for Hispanic and Latinx directors.

Investing in Digital Skills

After helping over 80 million jobseekers around the world access digital
skilling resources, we introduced a new Skills for Jobs initiative to support
a more skills-based labor market, with greater flexibility and accessible
learning paths to develop the right skills needed for the most in-demand jobs.
Our Skills for Jobs initiative brings together learning resources,
certification opportunities, and job-seeker tools from LinkedIn, GitHub, and
Microsoft Learn, and is built on data insights drawn from LinkedIn's Economic
Graph.

We also launched a national campaign to help skill and recruit 250,000 people
into the cybersecurity workforce by 2025, representing half of the country's
workforce shortage. To that end, we are making curriculum available free of
charge to all of the nation's higher education institutions, providing
training for new and existing faculty, and providing scholarships and
supplemental resources to 25,000 students. We have expanded the cyber skills
initiative to 27 additional countries that show elevated cyberthreat risks
coupled with significant gaps in their cybersecurity workforces, partnering
with nonprofits and other educational institutions to train the next
generation of cybersecurity workers.

Generative AI is creating unparalleled opportunities to empower workers
globally, but only if everyone has the skills to use it. To address this, in
June 2023 we launched a new AI Skills Initiative to help everyone learn how to
harness the power of AI. This includes a new LinkedIn learning pathway
offering new coursework on learning the foundations of generative AI. We also
launched a new global grant challenge to uncover new ways of training workers
on generative AI and are providing greater access to digital learning events
and resources for everyone to improve their AI fluency.

HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES

Overview

Microsoft aims to recruit, develop, and retain world-changing talent from a
diversity of backgrounds. To foster their and our success, we seek to create
an environment where people can thrive and do their best work. We strive to
maximize the potential of our human capital resources by creating a
respectful, rewarding, and inclusive work environment that enables our global
employees to create products and services that further our mission.

PART I

Item 1

As of June 30, 2023, we employed approximately 221,000 people on a full-time
basis, 120,000 in the U.S. and 101,000 internationally. Of the total employed
people, 89,000 were in operations, including manufacturing, distribution,
product support, and consulting services; 72,000 were in product research and
development; 45,000 were in sales and marketing; and 15,000 were in general
and administration. Certain employees are subject to collective bargaining
agreements.

Our Culture

Microsoft's culture is grounded in growth mindset. This means everyone is on a
continuous journey to learn and grow, operating as one company instead of
multiple siloed businesses.

Our employee listening systems enable us to gather feedback directly from our
workforce to inform our programs and employee needs globally. Employees
participate in our Employee Signals surveys, which cover a variety of topics
such as thriving, inclusion, team culture, wellbeing, and learning and
development. We also collect Daily Signals employee survey responses, giving
us real-time insights into ways we can support our employees. In addition to
Employee Signals and Daily Signals surveys, we gain insights through
onboarding, exit surveys, internal Viva Engage channels, employee Q&A
sessions, and our internal AskHR Service support.

Diversity and inclusion are core to our business model, and we hold ourselves
accountable for driving global systemic change in our workforce and creating
an inclusive work environment. We support multiple highly active Employee
Resource Groups for women, families, racial and ethnic minorities, military,
people with disabilities, and employees who identify as LGBTQIA+, where
employees can go for support, networking, and community-building. As described
in our 2022 Proxy Statement, annual performance and compensation reviews of
our senior leadership team include an evaluation of their contributions to
employee culture and diversity. To ensure accountability over time, we
publicly disclose our progress on a multitude of workforce metrics including:

•

Detailed breakdowns of gender, racial, and ethnic minority representation in
our employee population, with data by job types, levels, and segments of our
business.

•

Our EEO-1 report (equal employment opportunity).

•

Disability representation.

•

Pay equity (see details below).

Total Rewards and Pay Equity

We develop dynamic, sustainable, market-driven, and strategic programs with
the goal of providing a highly differentiated portfolio to attract, reward,
and retain top talent and enable our employees to thrive. These programs
reinforce our culture and values such as collaboration and growth mindset.
Managers evaluate and recommend rewards based on, for example, how well we
leverage the work of others and contribute to the success of our colleagues.
We monitor pay equity and career progress across multiple dimensions. Our
total compensation opportunity is highly differentiated and is market
competitive.

In order to manage our costs in a dynamic, competitive environment, in fiscal
year 2023 we announced that base salaries of salaried employees would remain
at fiscal year 2022 levels. Pay increases continue to be available for
rewards-eligible hourly and equivalent employees. We will continue our
practice of investing in stock for all rewards-eligible employees, salaried
and hourly, and investing in bonuses for all eligible employees.

PART I

Item 1

Since 2016, we have reported on pay equity as part of our annual Diversity and
Inclusion report. In 2022, we reported that all racial and ethnic minority
employees in the U.S. combined earn $1.008 for every $1.000 earned by their
white counterparts, that women in the U.S. earn $1.007 for every $1.000 earned
by their counterparts who are men, and that women outside the U.S. earn $1.002
for every $1.000 earned by their counterparts outside the U.S. who are men. In
this year's report, we again expanded our pay equity data beyond the U.S. to
report on 61 additional countries (up from 12 last year), representing 99.8%
of our global Microsoft workforce.

In addition, we began reporting on unadjusted median pay in our annual report,
comparing total pay amounts for all employees regardless of factors such as
job title, level, or tenure. For employees who are eligible for rewards, the
analysis showed that total pay for women is 89.6% of total pay for men in the
U.S. and 86.2% outside of the U.S., and total pay for racial and ethnic
minorities in the U.S. is 89.9% of total pay for white employees. As we
continue to increase representation for women and racial and ethnic minorities
at more senior levels, and continue to ensure pay equity for all, the gap
between the medians will reduce.

Our intended result is a global performance and development approach that
fosters our culture, and competitive compensation that ensures equitable pay
by role while supporting pay for performance.

Wellbeing and Hybrid Work

Microsoft is committed to supporting our employees' wellbeing while they are
at work and in their personal lives. We have invested significantly in
wellbeing, and offer a differentiated benefits package which includes many
physical, emotional, and financial wellness programs including counseling
through the Microsoft CARES Employee Assistance Program, mental wellbeing
support, flexible fitness benefits, disability accommodations, savings and
investment tools, adoption assistance, and back-up care for children and
elders. Finally, our Occupational Health and Safety program helps ensure
employees can stay safe while they are working.

We introduced Hybrid Workplace Flexibility Guidance to better support leaders,
managers, and employees in hybrid work scenarios. Our ongoing survey data
shows that 93% of employees value the flexibility related to work location,
work site, and work hours, and 78% are satisfied with the quality of
connection with co-workers. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to flexible
work at Microsoft. As a company, we will continue to leverage data and
research to inform decision making, balancing the needs of business, team, and
individual.

Learning and Development

We offer a range of learning opportunities, including personalized
opportunities on our internal and external learning portals, in-classroom
learning, required learning on compliance and company culture, on-the-job
advancement opportunities, and manager coaching. We also provide customized
manager learning, new employee orientation, and tools for operating in a
flexible hybrid work environment.

All Microsoft employees globally access our single Viva Learning tool for both
required and personal choice learning. This includes courses focused on our
core principles and compliance matters, such as Business Conduct, Privacy,
Security Foundations, and Harassment Prevention. We also deliver skills
training for employees based on their profession and role discipline.

We have over 27,000 people managers, all of whom must complete between 20-33
hours of compulsory training on leadership and management and are assigned
additional targeted training on an ongoing basis related to people management,
compliance, and culture.

jobs, and connect with talent through additional services like premium search.
Sales Solutions help companies strengthen customer relationships, empower
teams with digital selling tools, and acquire new opportunities. LinkedIn has
over 950 million members and has offices around the globe. Growth will depend
on our ability to increase the number of LinkedIn members and our ability to
continue offering services that provide value for our members and increase
their engagement. LinkedIn revenue is mainly affected by demand from
enterprises and professional organizations for subscriptions to Talent
Solutions, Sales Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions offerings, as well as
member engagement and the quality of the sponsored content delivered to those
members to drive Marketing Solutions.

Dynamics

Dynamics provides cloud-based and on-premises business solutions for financial
management, enterprise resource planning ("ERP"), customer relationship
management ("CRM"), supply chain management, and other application development
platforms for small and medium businesses, large organizations, and divisions
of global enterprises. Dynamics revenue is driven by the number of users
licensed and applications consumed, expansion of average revenue per user, and
the continued shift to Dynamics 365, a unified set of cloud-based intelligent
business applications, including Power Apps and Power Automate.

Competition

Competitors to Office include software and global application vendors, such as
Apple, Cisco Systems, Meta, Google, Okta, Proofpoint, Slack, Symantec, Zoom,
and numerous web-based and mobile application competitors as well as local
application developers. Apple distributes versions of its pre-installed

industry-specific, and easy-to-use productivity and collaboration tools and
services that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies
our customers already have both on-premises or in the cloud.

LinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting
companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing
on talent management and human resource services; job boards; traditional
recruiting firms; and companies that provide learning and development products
and services. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets
that generate revenue from advertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions
competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation
and customer intelligence and insights.

Dynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution providers
such as Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP.

Intelligent Cloud

Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid
server products and cloud services that can power modern business and
developers. This segment primarily comprises:

•

Server products and cloud services, including Azure and other cloud services;
SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client
Access Licenses ("CALs"); and Nuance and GitHub.

•

Enterprise Services, including Enterprise Support Services, Industry Solutions
(formerly Microsoft Consulting Services), and Nuance professional services.

Server Products and Cloud Services

Azure is a comprehensive set of cloud services that offer developers, IT
professionals, and enterprises freedom to build, deploy, and manage
applications on any platform or device. Customers can use Azure through our
global network of datacenters for computing, networking, storage, mobile and
web application services, AI, IoT, cognitive services, and machine learning.
Azure enables customers to devote more resources to development and use of
applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-
premises hardware and software. Azure revenue is mainly affected by
infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service consumption-based
services, and per user-based services such as Enterprise Mobility + Security.

Azure AI offerings provide a competitive advantage as companies seek ways to
optimize and scale their business with machine learning. Azure's purpose-
built, AI-optimized infrastructure allows advanced models, including GPT-4
services designed for developers and data scientists, to do more with less.
Customers can integrate large language models and develop the next generation
of AI apps and services.

Our server products are designed to make IT professionals, developers, and
their systems more productive and efficient. Server software is integrated
server infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications
built on the Windows Server operating system. This includes the server
platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations,
virtualization, service-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity
software. We also license standalone and software development lifecycle tools
for software architects, developers, testers, and project managers. Server
products revenue is mainly affected by purchases through volume licensing
programs, licenses sold to original equipment manufacturers ("OEM"), and
retail packaged products. CALs provide access rights to certain server
products, including SQL Server and Windows Server, and revenue is reported
along with the associated server product.

Nuance and GitHub include both cloud and on-premises offerings. Nuance
provides healthcare and enterprise AI solutions. GitHub provides a
collaboration platform and code hosting service for developers.

Enterprise Services

Enterprise Services, including Enterprise Support Services, Industry
Solutions, and Nuance Professional Services, assist customers in developing,
deploying, and managing Microsoft server solutions, Microsoft desktop
solutions, and Nuance conversational AI and ambient intelligent solutions,
along with providing training and certification to developers and IT
professionals on various Microsoft products.

Competition

Azure faces diverse competition from companies such as Amazon, Google, IBM,
Oracle, VMware, and open source offerings. Azure's competitive advantage
includes enabling a hybrid cloud, allowing deployment of existing datacenters
with our public cloud into a single, cohesive infrastructure, and the ability
to run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and
complexities. Our AI offerings compete with AI products from hyperscalers such
as Amazon Bedrock, Amazon CodeWhisperer, and Google AI, as well as products
from other emerging competitors, many of which are also current or potential
partners, including Meta's LLaMA2 and other open source solutions. Our
Enterprise Mobility + Security offerings also compete with products from a
range of competitors including identity vendors, security solution vendors,
and numerous other security point solution vendors. We believe our cloud's
global scale, coupled with our broad portfolio of identity and security
solutions, allows us to effectively solve complex cybersecurity challenges for
our customers and differentiates us from the competition.

PART I

Item 1

Our server products face competition from a wide variety of server operating
systems and applications offered by companies with a range of market
approaches. Vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as Hewlett-
Packard, IBM, and Oracle offer their own versions of the Unix operating system
preinstalled on server hardware. Nearly all computer manufacturers offer
server hardware for the Linux operating system, and many contribute to Linux
operating system development. The competitive position of Linux has also
benefited from the large number of compatible applications now produced by
many commercial and non-commercial software developers. A number of companies,
such as Red Hat, supply versions of Linux.

We compete to provide enterprise-wide computing solutions and point solutions
with numerous commercial software vendors that offer solutions and middleware
technology platforms, software applications for connectivity (both Internet
and intranet), security, hosting, database, and e-business servers. IBM and
Oracle lead a group of companies focused on the Java Platform Enterprise
Edition that competes with our enterprise-wide computing solutions. Commercial
competitors for our server applications for PC-based distributed client-server
environments include CA Technologies, IBM, and Oracle. Our web application
platform software competes with open source software such as Apache, Linux,
MySQL, and PHP. In middleware, we compete against Java vendors.

Our database, business intelligence, and data warehousing solutions offerings
compete with products from IBM, Oracle, SAP, Snowflake, and other companies.
Our system management solutions compete with server management and server
virtualization platform providers, such as BMC, CA Technologies, Hewlett-
Packard, IBM, and VMware. Our products for software developers compete against
offerings from Adobe, IBM, Oracle, and other companies, and also against open
source projects, including Eclipse (sponsored by CA Technologies, IBM, Oracle,
and SAP), PHP, and Ruby on Rails.

We believe our server products provide customers with advantages in
performance, total costs of ownership, and productivity by delivering superior
applications, development tools, compatibility with a broad base of hardware
and software applications, security, and manageability.

Our Enterprise Services business competes with a wide range of companies that
provide strategy and business planning, application development, and
infrastructure services, including multinational consulting firms and small
niche businesses focused on specific technologies.

More Personal Computing

Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put
customers at the center of the experience with our technology. This segment
primarily comprises:

•

Windows, including Windows OEM licensing ("Windows OEM") and other non-volume
licensing of the Windows operating system; Windows Commercial, comprising
volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and
other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; and Windows IoT.

•

Devices, including Surface, HoloLens, and PC accessories.

•

Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising
first- and third-party content (including games and in-game content), Xbox
Game Pass and other subscriptions, Xbox Cloud Gaming, advertising, third-party
disc royalties, and other cloud services.

•

Search and news advertising, comprising Bing (including Bing Chat), Microsoft
News, Microsoft Edge, and third-party affiliates.

Windows

The Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing
experience for users by enabling consistency of experience, applications, and
information across their devices. Windows OEM revenue is impacted
significantly by the number of Windows operating system licenses purchased by
OEMs, which they pre-install on the devices they sell. In addition to
computing device market volume, Windows OEM revenue is impacted by:

•

The mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size.

•

Differences in device market demand between developed markets and growth
markets.

•

Attachment of Windows to devices shipped.

•

Customer mix between consumer, small and medium businesses, and large
enterprises.

•

Changes in inventory levels in the OEM channel.

•

Pricing changes and promotions, pricing variation that occurs when the mix of
devices manufactured shifts from local and regional system builders to large
multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows versions licensed.

•

Constraints in the supply chain of device components.

•

Piracy.

Windows Commercial revenue, which includes volume licensing of the Windows
operating system and Windows cloud services such as Microsoft Defender for
Endpoint, is affected mainly by the demand from commercial customers for
volume licensing and Software Assurance ("SA"), as well as advanced security
offerings. Windows Commercial revenue often reflects the number of information
workers in a licensed enterprise and is relatively independent of the number
of PCs sold in a given year.

Patent licensing includes our programs to license patents we own for use
across a broad array of technology areas, including mobile devices and cloud
offerings.

Windows IoT extends the power of Windows and the cloud to intelligent systems
by delivering specialized operating systems, tools, and services for use in
embedded devices.

Devices

We design and sell devices, including Surface, HoloLens, and PC accessories.
Our devices are designed to enable people and organizations to connect to the
people and content that matter most using Windows and integrated Microsoft
products and services. Surface is designed to help organizations, students,
and consumers be more productive. Growth in Devices is dependent on total PC
shipments, the ability to attract new customers, our product roadmap, and
expanding into new categories.

Gaming

Our gaming platform is designed to provide a variety of entertainment through
a unique combination of content, community, and cloud services. Our exclusive
game content is created through Xbox Game Studios, a collection of first-party
studios creating iconic and differentiated gaming experiences. We continue to
invest in new gaming studios and content to expand our intellectual property
roadmap and leverage new content creators. These unique gaming experiences are
the cornerstone of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service and gaming community
with access to a curated library of over 400 first- and third-party console
and PC titles.

The gamer remains at the heart of the Xbox ecosystem. We are identifying new
opportunities to attract gamers across a variety of different end points
through our first- and third-party content and business diversification across
subscriptions, ads, and digital stores. We've seen new devices from third-
party manufacturers along with key PC and mobile end points that help us
empower gamers to play in a way that is most convenient to them. We are
focused on growing the platform and expanding to new ecosystems to engage as
many gamers as possible.

Xbox enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences that are
accessible on Xbox consoles, Windows-enabled devices, and other devices. Xbox
is designed to benefit users by providing access to a network of certified
applications and services and to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems
by providing access to a large customer base. Xbox revenue is mainly affected
by subscriptions and sales of first- and third-party content, as well as
advertising. Growth of our Gaming business is determined by the overall active
user base through Xbox enabled content, availability of games, providing
exclusive game content that gamers seek, the computational power and
reliability of the devices used to access our content and services, and the
ability to create new experiences through first-party content creators.

Search and News Advertising

Our Search and news advertising business is designed to deliver relevant
search, native, and display advertising to a global audience. Our Microsoft
Edge browser and Bing Chat capabilities are key tools to enable user
acquisition and engagement, while our technology platform enables accelerated
delivery of digital advertising solutions. In addition to first-party tools,
we have several partnerships with companies, such as Yahoo, through which we
provide and monetize search offerings. Growth depends on our ability to
attract new users, understand intent, and match intent with relevant content
on advertising offerings.

Competition

Windows faces competition from various software products and from alternative
platforms and devices, mainly from Apple and Google. We believe Windows
competes effectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security,
an easy-to-use interface, and compatibility with a broad range of hardware and
software applications, including those that enable productivity.

Devices face competition from various computer, tablet, and hardware
manufacturers who offer a unique combination of high-quality industrial design
and innovative technologies across various price points. These manufacturers,
many of which are also current or potential partners and customers, include
Apple and our Windows OEMs.

Xbox and our cloud gaming services face competition from various online gaming
ecosystems and game streaming services, including those operated by Amazon,
Apple, Meta, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of
entertainment services such as video streaming platforms. Our gaming platform
competes with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony, both of which have a
large, established base of customers. We believe our gaming platform is
effectively positioned against, and uniquely differentiated from, competitive
products and services based on significant innovation in hardware
architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment
services, and continued strong exclusive content from our own first-party game
franchises as well as other digital content offerings.

Our Search and news advertising business competes with Google and a wide array
of websites, social platforms like Meta, and portals that provide content and
online offerings to end users.

OPERATIONS

We have regional operations service centers that support our operations,
including customer contract and order processing, billing, credit and
collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The
center in Ireland supports the African, Asia-Pacific, European, and Middle
East regions; and the centers in Arlington, Virginia, Atlanta, Georgia,
Charlotte, North Carolina, Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida,
Redmond, Washington, Reno, Nevada, and Puerto Rico support the American
regions.

In addition to our operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout
each of these regions. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to
expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the
evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI
services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and
buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers,
including graphics processing units ("GPUs") and other components.

Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers.
For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other
manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our
requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for
which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these
suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet
consumer demand.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Product and Service Development, and Intellectual Property

We develop most of our products and services internally through the following
engineering groups.

•

Cloud and AI - focuses on making IT professionals, developers, partners,
independent software vendors, and their systems more productive and efficient
through development of Azure AI platform and cloud infrastructure, server,
database, CRM, ERP, software development tools and services (including
GitHub), AI cognitive services, and other business process applications and
services for enterprises.

•

Strategic Missions and Technologies - focuses on incubating technical products
and support solutions with transformative potential for the future of cloud
computing and continued company growth across quantum computing, Azure Space &
Missions Engineering, telecommunications, and Microsoft Federal Sales and
Delivery.

•

Experiences and Devices - focuses on delivering high value end-user
experiences across our products, services, and devices, including Microsoft
365, Windows, Microsoft Teams, Search (including Microsoft Edge and Bing Chat)
and other advertising-based services, and the Surface line of devices.

•

Microsoft Security - focuses on delivering a comprehensive portfolio of
services that protect our customers' digital infrastructure through cloud
platform and application security, data protection and governance, identity
and network access, and device management.

•

Technology and Research - focuses on fundamental research, product and
business incubations, and forward-looking AI innovations that span
infrastructure, services, and applications.

•

LinkedIn - focuses on our services that transform the way professionals grow
their network and find jobs and the way businesses hire, market, sell, and
learn.

•

Gaming - focuses on developing hardware, content, and services across a large
range of platforms to help grow our user base through game experiences and
social interaction.

Internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come
from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products
and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and
enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive
to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and
hardware advances that may affect software and hardware design. Before
releasing new software platforms, and as we make significant modifications to
existing platforms, we provide application vendors with a range of resources
and guidelines for development, training, and testing. Generally, we also
create product documentation internally.

We protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work
actively in the U.S. and internationally to ensure the enforcement of
copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our
software and hardware products, services, business plans, and branding. We are
a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a
portfolio of over 70,000 U.S. and international patents issued and over 19,000
pending worldwide. While we employ much of our internally-developed
intellectual property in our products and services, we also engage in outbound
licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into
licensees' products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license
agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents.
We may also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our
products and services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly
available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as
promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, supporting societal
and/or environmental efforts, or attracting and enabling our external
development community. Our increasing engagement with open source software
will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in
certain situations.

While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to
various aspects of our products and services, we believe, based upon past
experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on
commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product
development are not materially dependent on any single license or other
agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products.

Investing in the Future

Our success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products,
services, and experiences for our users, to initiate and embrace disruptive
technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive
broad adoption of our products and services. We invest in a range of emerging
technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant
opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company.
Based on our assessment of key technology trends, we maintain our long-term
commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies,
tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud
computing, AI, devices, and operating systems.

While our main product research and development facilities are located in
Redmond, Washington, we also operate research and development facilities in
other parts of the U.S. and around the world. This global approach helps us
remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top
talent from across the world.

We plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of
product research and development activities, and as appropriate we will
coordinate our research and development across operating segments and leverage
the results across the company.

In addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate
Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research is one of the world's largest corporate
research organizations, often working in close collaboration with top
universities around the world, and is focused on advancing the state-of-the-
art in computer science and a broad range of other disciplines. Our investment
in fundamental research provides us a unique perspective on future trends and
contributes to our innovation.

DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING

We market and distribute our products and services through the following
channels: OEMs, direct, and distributors and resellers. Our sales organization
performs a variety of functions, including working directly with commercial
enterprises and public-sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet
their technology and digital transformation requirements; managing OEM
relationships; and supporting system integrators, independent software
vendors, and other partners who engage directly with our customers to perform
sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our products and services.

OEMs

We distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our
software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the
OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs
also sell devices pre-installed with other Microsoft products and services,
including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to
Office 365.

There are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest category of OEMs are
direct OEMs as our relationship with them is managed through a direct
agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements
covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational
OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and
local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting
of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-
installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft
distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship
with Microsoft.

Direct

Many organizations that license our products and services transact directly
with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with
sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web
agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and
services ("Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors" or "ESA"). Microsoft offers
direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate
customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large
network of partner advisors support many of these sales.

We also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to
customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through our digital
marketplaces and online stores. Additionally, our Microsoft Experience Centers
are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers
across industries.

Distributors and Resellers

Organizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily
through licensing solution partners ("LSP"), distributors, value-added
resellers ("VAR"), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may
reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large
organizations, distributors resell primarily to VARs, and VARs typically reach
small and medium organizations. ESAs are also typically authorized as LSPs and
operate as resellers for our other volume licensing programs. Microsoft Cloud
Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.

We distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non-
exclusive distributors, authorized replicators, resellers, and retail outlets.
Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets.
We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of
field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders
from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales
support.

Our Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a
global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and
specialized services.

LICENSING OPTIONS

We offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services,
on-premises software, and SA. We license software to organizations under
volume licensing agreements to allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses
of products and services instead of having to acquire separate licenses
through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide
flexibility for organizations of various sizes. While these programs may
differ in various parts of the world, generally they include those discussed
below.

SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released
over the contract period. It also provides support, tools, training, and other
licensing benefits to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. SA
is included with certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional
purchase with others.

Volume Licensing Programs

Enterprise Agreement

Enterprise Agreements offer large organizations a manageable volume licensing
program that gives them the flexibility to buy cloud services and software
licenses under one agreement. Enterprise Agreements are designed for medium or
large organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises
software organization-wide over a three-year period. Organizations can elect
to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is included.

Microsoft Customer Agreement

A Microsoft Customer Agreement is a simplified purchase agreement presented,
accepted, and stored through a digital experience. A Microsoft Customer
Agreement is a non-expiring agreement that is designed to support all
customers over time, whether purchasing through a partner or directly from
Microsoft.

Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement

A Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement is designed for small and medium
organizations that want to subscribe to, activate, provision, and maintain
cloud services seamlessly and directly via the web. The agreement allows
customers to acquire monthly or annual subscriptions for cloud-based services.

Microsoft Products and Services Agreement

Microsoft Products and Services Agreements are designed for medium and large
organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software as
needed, with no organization-wide commitment, under a single, non-expiring
agreement. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses.
SA is optional for customers that purchase perpetual licenses.

Item 1

Open Value

Open Value agreements are a simple, cost-effective way to acquire the latest
Microsoft technology. These agreements are designed for small and medium
organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software
over a three-year period. Under Open Value agreements, organizations can elect
to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses and SA is included.

Select Plus

A Select Plus agreement is designed for government and academic organizations
to acquire on-premises licenses at any affiliate or department level, while
realizing advantages as one organization. Organizations purchase perpetual
licenses and SA is optional.

Partner Programs

The Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider Program offers customers an easy way to
license the cloud services they need in combination with the value-added
services offered by their systems integrator, managed services provider, or
cloud reseller partner. Partners in this program can easily package their own
products and services to directly provision, manage, and support their
customer subscriptions.

The Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement allows hosting service
providers and independent software vendors who want to license eligible
Microsoft software products to provide software services and hosted
applications to their end customers. Partners license software over a three-
year period and are billed monthly based on consumption.

The Independent Software Vendor Royalty Program enables partners to integrate
Microsoft products into other applications and then license the unified
business solution to their end users.

CUSTOMERS

Our customers include individual consumers, small and medium organizations,
large global enterprises, public-sector institutions, Internet service
providers, application developers, and OEMs. Our practice is to ship our
products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers;
consequently, backlog is not significant.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and
uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the
trading price of our common stock.

STRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS

We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services,
which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins.

Competition in the technology sector

Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with
significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms
whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying
technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of
our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve
rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and
frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain
competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and
services that appeal to businesses and consumers.

Competition among platform-based ecosystems

An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based
ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-
established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users,
application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth.
Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and
maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that
provide competing platforms.

•

A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the
software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has
succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets,
phones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint devices. Competitors
pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the
hardware and software platform, including applications and content sold
through their integrated marketplaces. They may also be able to claim security
and performance benefits from their vertically integrated offer. We also offer
some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services. To the
extent we shift a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model we
increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins.

•

We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on
PCs. We face significant competition from competing platforms developed for
new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These
devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of
the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning to these devices
to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers.
Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer,
the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract
application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with
operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating
system margins. Popular products or services offered on competing platforms
could increase their competitive strength. In addition, some of our devices
compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer ("OEM")
partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform.

•

Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and
significant installed bases. The variety and utility of content and
applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing
decisions. Users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and
applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist
developers to write applications for our platform and ensure that these
applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value. Efforts
to compete with competitors' content and application marketplaces may increase
our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins. Competitors' rules
governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict our ability
to distribute products and services through them in accordance with our
technical and business model objectives.

23

* * *

PART I

Item 1A

Business model competition

Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.

•

Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and
software-as-a-service business model, the license-based proprietary software
model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue. We bear the
costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments
in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received
from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell
software to businesses and consumers under this model.

•

We are investing in artificial intelligence ("AI") across the entire company
and infusing generative AI capabilities into our consumer and commercial
offerings. We expect AI technology and services to be a highly competitive and
rapidly evolving market. We will bear significant development and operational
costs to build and support the AI capabilities, products, and services
necessary to meet the needs of our customers. To compete effectively we must
also be responsive to technological change, potential regulatory developments,
and public scrutiny.

•

Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services, and
content, and make money by selling third-party advertising. Advertising
revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide
to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating
products.

•

Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source
software at little or no cost to end users, using open source AI models, and
earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services. These
firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the open
source products. Some open source products mimic the features and
functionality of our products.

The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes,
price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and
development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue,
gross margins, and operating income.

Our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and
competitive risks. A growing part of our business involves cloud-based
services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic
vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and
productivity services that utilize ubiquitous computing and ambient
intelligence to drive insights and productivity gains. At the same time, our
competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for
consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving.
Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and
sometimes the user's choice of which cloud-based services to use. Certain
industries and customers have specific requirements for cloud services and may
present enhanced risks. We are devoting significant resources to develop and
deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue to
evolve with this changing environment. We embrace cultural and organizational
changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. Our
intelligent cloud and intelligent edge offerings are connected to the growth
of the Internet of Things ("IoT"), a network of distributed and interconnected
devices employing sensors, data, and computing capabilities, including AI. Our
success in driving ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence will depend
on the level of adoption of our offerings such as Azure, Azure AI, and Azure
IoT Edge. We may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale
necessary to meet our business objectives.

Besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and
maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These costs will
reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we succeed
in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including:

•

Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate
increasing traffic and market share.

•

Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based
services on the growing array of computing devices, including PCs,
smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices, as well as sensors
and other IoT endpoints.

•

Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party
developers.

•

Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our
customers and maintain the security of their data as well as help them meet
their own compliance needs.

•

Making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a
wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of our competitors.

24

* * *

PART I

Item 1A

It is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the
revenue required to succeed. If we are not effective in executing
organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate
innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and
services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and
development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross
margins and operating income.

Some users may engage in fraudulent or abusive activities through our cloud-
based services. These include unauthorized use of accounts through stolen
credentials, use of stolen credit cards or other payment vehicles, failure to
pay for services accessed, or other activities that violate our terms of
service such as cryptocurrency mining or launching cyberattacks. If our
efforts to detect such violations or our actions to control these types of
fraud and abuse are not effective, we may experience adverse impacts to our
revenue or incur reputational damage.

RISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS

We make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve
expected returns. We will continue to make significant investments in
research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and
technologies, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft 365, Bing, SQL
Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, and other products
and services. In addition, we are focused on developing new AI platform
services and incorporating AI into existing products and services. We also
invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for
productivity, communication, and entertainment, including PCs, tablets, gaming
devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative.
Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness,
developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do
not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality
or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware
products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve
significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel
investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be
profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new
products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced
historically. We may not get engagement in certain features, like Microsoft
Edge, Bing, and Bing Chat, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities.
Our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to
be under scrutiny. Perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity
or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, could
negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product
quality.

Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and
testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in
creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.

Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse
effect on our business. We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering
into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business
strategy. For example, in March 2021 we completed our acquisition of ZeniMax
Media Inc. for $8.1 billion, and in March 2022 we completed our acquisition of
Nuance Communications, Inc. for $18.8 billion. In January 2022 we announced a
definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc. for $68.7 billion.
In January 2023 we announced the third phase of our OpenAI strategic
partnership. Acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve
significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our
business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment,
that they raise new compliance-related obligations and challenges, that we
have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and
technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that
announced transactions may not be completed. If an arrangement fails to
adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may
result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success
of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to
leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop
compelling new ones, as well as acquired companies' ability to meet our
policies and processes in areas such as data governance, privacy, and
cybersecurity. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits
from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced
efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected.
These events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.

25

* * *

PART I

Item 1A

If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be
required to record a significant charge to earnings. We acquire other
companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit
from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or
intangibles. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that
may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our
goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a
decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow
estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we
participate. We have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required
to record, a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements
during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable
intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of
operations.

CYBERSECURITY, DATA PRIVACY, AND PLATFORM ABUSE RISKS

Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue,
increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation or competitive
position.

Security of our information technology

Threats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of
hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored
organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose
threats to our customers and our IT. These actors may use a wide variety of
methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or
exploiting vulnerabilities or intentionally designed processes in hardware,
software, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services
or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering
techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose
passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access
to our data or our users' or customers' data, or acting in a coordinated
manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks.
Nation-state and state-sponsored actors can deploy significant resources to
plan and carry out attacks. Nation-state attacks against us, our customers, or
our partners may intensify during periods of intense diplomatic or armed
conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Inadequate account security
or organizational security practices may also result in unauthorized access to
confidential data. For example, system administrators may fail to timely
remove employee account access when no longer appropriate. Employees or third
parties may intentionally compromise our or our users' security or systems or
reveal confidential information. Malicious actors may employ the IT supply
chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier
accounts or hardware.

Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated
and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending
against them. We may have no current capability to detect certain
vulnerabilities or new attack methods, which may allow them to persist in the
environment over long periods of time. Cyberthreats can have cascading impacts
that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and
those of our partners and customers. Breaches of our facilities, network, or
data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business
applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and
protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays,
compromise confidential or technical business information harming our
reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our
intellectual property or other assets, subject us to ransomware attacks,
require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the
impacts of attacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business. We are also
subject to supply chain cyberattacks where malware can be introduced to a
software provider's customers, including us, through software updates.

In addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often, we are
early adopters of new devices and technologies. We embrace new ways of sharing
data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using
methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies.
Increasing use of generative AI models in our internal systems may create new
attack methods for adversaries. Our business policies and internal security
controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge, or
emerging cybersecurity regulations in jurisdictions worldwide.

26

* * *

PART I

Item 1A

Security of our products, services, devices, and customers' data

The security of our products and services is important in our customers'
decisions to purchase or use our products or services across cloud and on-
premises environments. Security threats are a significant challenge to
companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services
to others. Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also affect our customers.
Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our
infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third
parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their
data. Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating
systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to
continue. In addition, adversaries can attack our customers' on-premises or
cloud environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown ("zero day")
vulnerabilities, such as occurred in early calendar year 2021 with several of
our Exchange Server on-premises products. Vulnerabilities in these or any
product can persist even after we have issued security patches if customers
have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the
vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further
compromise customers' systems. Adversaries will continue to attack customers
using our cloud services as customers embrace digital transformation.
Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to
compromise our users' accounts, including where accounts share the same
attributes such as passwords. Inadequate account security practices may also
result in unauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or
other malicious software impacting a customer's use of our products or
services. We are increasingly incorporating open source software into our
products. There may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make
our products susceptible to cyberattacks. Additionally, we are actively adding
new generative AI features to our services. Because generative AI is a new
field, understanding of security risks and protection methods continues to
develop; features that rely on generative AI may be susceptible to
unanticipated security threats from sophisticated adversaries.

Our customers operate complex IT systems with third-party hardware and
software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired over many
years. They expect our products and services to support all these systems and
products, including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current
security advances or standards. As a result, we may not be able to discontinue
support in our services for a product, service, standard, or feature solely
because a more secure alternative is available. Failure to utilize the most
current security advances and standards can increase our customers'
vulnerability to attack. Further, customers of widely varied size and
technical sophistication use our technology, and consequently may still have
limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state of
the art cybersecurity practices and technologies. In addition, we must account
for this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining default
settings for our products and services, including security default settings,
as these settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of IT operations
and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these
defaults.

Cyberattacks may adversely impact our customers even if our production
services are not directly compromised. We are committed to notifying our
customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have
actionable information for customers to help protect themselves. We are also
committed to providing guidance and support on detection, tracking, and
remediation. We may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these
attacks for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track
an attack, especially where an attack involves on-premises software such as
Exchange Server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers'
computing environments.

Development and deployment of defensive measures

To defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based
services, and our customers' systems, we must continuously engineer more
secure products and services, enhance security, threat detection, and
reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address
security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by
others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from
attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital
security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products,
and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus
software, and advanced security and information about the need to deploy
security measures and the impact of doing so. Customers in certain industries
such as financial services, health care, and government may have enhanced or
specialized requirements to which we must engineer our products and services.

Item 1A

The cost of measures to protect products and customer-facing services could
reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well, actual or
perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data
corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead
customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to
services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also spend
more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could
delay adoption of additional products or services. Customers, and third
parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems,
continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may
fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to
adopt adequate security practices. Any of these could adversely affect our
reputation and revenue. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims
against us. Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate
or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these provisions
will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achieve commercial objectives,
we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers.

Our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and
components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. If there is a security
vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit
targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced
revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position.

Disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our
reputation. As we continue to grow the number, breadth, and scale of our
cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of
personal data of our customers and users. The continued occurrence of high-
profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment
increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve
the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is
possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees
and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not
prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our
vendors store and manage. In addition, third parties who have limited access
to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper
disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to
customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect
personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software
products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process
personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we
host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or
user data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we
advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate
limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts
to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and
retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could
inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our
cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities.
Additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns,
or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate
datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules
or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our
products and services.

We may not be able to protect information in our products and services from
use by others. LinkedIn and other Microsoft products and services contain
valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or
technical measures. In certain cases, we have made commitments to our members
and users to limit access to or use of this information. Changes in the law or
interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties
from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other
measures and using it for their own benefit, thus diminishing the value of our
products and services.

Abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement.

Advertising, professional, marketplace, and gaming platform abuses

For platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come
from or can be influenced by third parties, including GitHub, LinkedIn,
Microsoft Advertising, Microsoft News, Microsoft Store, Bing, and Xbox, our
reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is
hostile or inappropriate. This activity may come from users impersonating
other people or organizations including through the use of AI technologies,
dissemination of information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to
manipulate the opinions of our users, or the use of our products or services
that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal
ends. Preventing or responding to these actions may require us to make
substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not
be successful, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial
statements.

Item 1A

Other digital safety abuses

Our hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used to
generate or disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our terms
or applicable law. We may not proactively discover such content due to scale,
the limitations of existing technologies, and conflicting legal frameworks.
When discovered by users and others, such content may negatively affect our
reputation, our brands, and user engagement. Regulations and other initiatives
to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content
online have been enacted, and we expect this to continue. We may be subject to
enhanced regulatory oversight, civil or criminal liability, or reputational
damage if we fail to comply with content moderation regulations, adversely
affecting our business and consolidated financial statements.

The development of the IoT presents security, privacy, and execution risks. To
support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge, we are
developing products, services, and technologies to power the IoT. The IoT's
great potential also carries substantial risks. IoT products and services may
contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation that make them insecure
or ineffective for their intended purposes. An IoT solution has multiple
layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of
which we may not develop or control. Each layer, including the weakest layer,
can impact the security of the whole system. Many IoT devices have limited
interfaces and ability to be updated or patched. IoT solutions may collect
large amounts of data, and our handling of IoT data may not satisfy customers
or regulatory requirements. IoT scenarios may increasingly affect personal
health and safety. If IoT solutions that include our technologies do not work
as intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be
subject to legal claims or enforcement actions. These risks, if realized, may
increase our costs, damage our reputation or brands, or negatively impact our
revenues or margins.

Issues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational or
competitive harm or liability. We are building AI into many of our offerings,
including our productivity services, and we are also making AI available for
our customers to use in solutions that they build. This AI may be developed by
Microsoft or others, including our strategic partner, OpenAI. We expect these
elements of our business to grow. We envision a future in which AI operating
in our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more
productive in their work and personal lives. As with many innovations, AI
presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore
our business. AI algorithms or training methodologies may be flawed. Datasets
may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased information. Content
generated by AI systems may be offensive, illegal, or otherwise harmful.
Ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by Microsoft
or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of AI solutions
or cause harm to individuals, customers, or society, or result in our products
and services not working as intended. Human review of certain outputs may be
required. As a result of these and other challenges associated with innovative
technologies, our implementation of AI systems could subject us to competitive
harm, regulatory action, legal liability, including under new proposed
legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the European Union ("EU"),
new applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property,
and other laws, and brand or reputational harm. Some AI scenarios present
ethical issues or may have broad impacts on society. If we enable or offer AI
solutions that have unintended consequences, unintended usage or customization
by our customers and partners, or are controversial because of their impact on
human rights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political
issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm, adversely affecting our
business and consolidated financial statements.

Item 1A

OPERATIONAL RISKS

We may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online
services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure. Our
increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our
products and services demand more computing power. We spend substantial
amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade
our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our
websites and in our datacenters. Our datacenters depend on the availability of
permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and
servers, including graphics processing units ("GPUs") and other components.
The cost or availability of these dependencies could be adversely affected by
a variety of factors, including the transition to a clean energy economy,
local and regional environmental regulations, and geopolitical disruptions.
These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services
and support the growth and the augmentation of existing services such as Bing,
Azure, Microsoft Account services, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics
365, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Skype, Xbox, and Outlook.com through the
incorporation of AI features and/or functionality. We are rapidly growing our
business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by
third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this
infrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires development of
principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety and
reliability risks. It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity
infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable
within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve.
Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss
of customer data, insufficient Internet connectivity, insufficient or
unavailable power supply, or inadequate storage and compute capacity, could
diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting
in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties,
regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and
potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely
impact our consolidated financial statements.

We may experience quality or supply problems. Our hardware products such as
Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design and market are
highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated
software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational
harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we
fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or
warranty repairs.

Our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability
problems. The highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and
other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers
increasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple
workloads. Many of our products and services are interdependent with one
another. Each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of
quality or reliability issues. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-
release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our
reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products
or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically
contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is
no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.

There are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. Our
competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware
components can affect the capacity available to us. If components are delayed
or become unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint,
industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources,
or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in
reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity to support the delivery and
continued development of our products and services. Component shortages,
excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory
adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices,
datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other
geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting
in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins.

LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS

Government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules
may limit how we design and market our products. Government agencies closely
scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Governments are
actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes
scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the EU, the U.S., and China.
Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of
anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities have
previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our
business.

30

* * *

PART I

Item 1A

For example, the European Commission ("the Commission") closely scrutinizes
the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make
certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming
interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. Flagship product
releases such as Windows can receive significant scrutiny under EU or other
competition laws.

Our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our
OEM partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms. As a result,
increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a
risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. Regulatory
scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign governments, particularly
in China and other countries in Asia, have advanced arguments under their
competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our
intellectual property.

Competition law regulatory actions and court decisions may result in fines or
hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and
businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that
comes from them. New competition law actions could be initiated, potentially
using previous actions as precedent. The outcome of such actions, or steps
taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including
causing us to withdraw products from or modify products for certain markets,
decreasing the value of our assets, adversely affecting our ability to
monetize our products, or inhibiting our ability to consummate acquisition or
impose conditions on acquisitions that may reduce their value.

Laws and regulations relating to anti-corruption and trade could result in
increased costs, fines, criminal penalties, or reputational damage. The
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and other anti-corruption laws and
regulations ("Anti-Corruption Laws") prohibit corrupt payments by our
employees, vendors, or agents, and the accounting provisions of the FCPA
require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal
controls. From time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S.
and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about
our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-
Corruption Laws. Periodically, we receive such reports directly and
investigate them, and also cooperate with investigations by U.S. and foreign
law enforcement authorities. An example of increasing international regulatory
complexity is the EU Whistleblower Directive, initiated in 2021, which may
present compliance challenges to the extent it is implemented in different
forms by EU member states. Most countries in which we operate also have
competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise
attempting to reduce competition between themselves. While we devote
substantial resources to our U.S. and international compliance programs and
have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce
the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, vendors,
or agents may violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption
Laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties,
criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on
the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation.

Increasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements
also affect our operations in and outside the U.S. relating to trade and
investment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the EU, and other countries
prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries. U.S. export
controls restrict Microsoft from offering many of its products and services
to, or making investments in, certain entities in specified countries. U.S.
import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and
communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government
review of transactions involving information and communications technology
from countries determined to be foreign adversaries. Supply chain regulations
may impact the availability of goods or result in additional regulatory
scrutiny. Periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing
conflict in Ukraine, may result in (1) new and rapidly evolving sanctions and
trade restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and
countries, and (2) negative impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our
customers, partners, and us. Non-compliance with sanctions as well as general
ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm, operational delays,
monetary fines, loss of revenues, increased costs, loss of export privileges,
or criminal sanctions.

Item 1A

Laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the
adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, fines
against us, or reputational damage. The growth of our Internet- and cloud-
based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data
across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection,
storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For
example, while the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework ("DPF") has been recognized
as adequate under EU law to allow transfers of personal data from the EU to
certified companies in the U.S., the DPF is subject to further legal challenge
which could cause the legal requirements for data transfers from the EU to be
uncertain. EU data protection authorities have and may again block the use of
certain U.S.-based services that involve the transfer of data to the U.S. In
the EU and other markets, potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of
data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our
products and services.

In addition, the EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), which applies
to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related
to products and services offered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance
obligations regarding the handling of personal data. More recently, the EU has
been developing new requirements related to the use of data, including in the
Digital Markets Act, the Digital Services Act, and the Data Act, that add
additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and
services. Engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate
compliance with these laws involve substantial expense and the diversion of
engineering resources from other projects. We might experience reduced demand
for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal
duties or help our customers meet their obligations under these and other data
regulations, or if our implementation to comply makes our offerings less
attractive. Compliance with these obligations depends in part on how
particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply, or if
regulators assert we have failed to comply (including in response to
complaints made by customers), it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions,
which can result in significant monetary penalties, private lawsuits,
reputational damage, blockage of international data transfers, and loss of
customers. The highest fines assessed under GDPR have recently been
increasing, especially against large technology companies. Jurisdictions
around the world, such as China, India, and states in the U.S. have adopted,
or are considering adopting or expanding, laws and regulations imposing
obligations regarding the collection, handling, and transfer of personal data.

Our investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value
of the services, including AI services, we deliver to customers, to
operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, and to customer
perceptions of quality. Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained
by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this
investment. Ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and inquiries by regulators of
Microsoft practices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result
in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data sovereignty and
localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and
use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of
that data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal
data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems
that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater
difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Compliance with data
regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and
functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. Failure to comply with
existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop
the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion
of management time and effort.

Existing and increasing legal and regulatory requirements could adversely
affect our results of operations. We are subject to a wide range of laws,
regulations, and legal requirements in the U.S. and globally, including those
that may apply to our products and online services offerings, and those that
impose requirements related to user privacy, telecommunications, data storage
and protection, advertising, and online content. Laws in several
jurisdictions, including EU Member State laws under the European Electronic
Communications Code, increasingly define certain of our services as regulated
telecommunications services. This trend may continue and will result in these
offerings being subjected to additional data protection, security, law
enforcement surveillance, and other obligations. Regulators and private
litigants may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data
and other information is inconsistent with their laws and regulations,
including laws that apply to the tracking of users via technology such as
cookies. New environmental, social, and governance laws and regulations are
expanding mandatory disclosure, reporting, and diligence requirements.
Legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may
increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services.
Compliance with evolving digital accessibility laws and standards will require
engineering and is important to our efforts to empower all people and
organizations to achieve more. Legislative and regulatory action is emerging
in the areas of AI and content moderation, which could increase costs or
restrict opportunity. For example, in the EU, an AI Act is being considered,
and may entail increased costs or decreased opportunities for the operation of
our AI services in the European market.

Item 1A

How these laws and regulations apply to our business is often unclear, subject
to change over time, and sometimes may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction. In addition, governments' approach to enforcement, and our
products and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with existing,
expanding, or new laws and regulations may involve significant costs or
require changes in products or business practices that could adversely affect
our results of operations. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of
penalties or orders we cease the alleged noncompliant activity. In addition,
there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors,
customers, and other stakeholders across many of these areas. If our products
do not meet customer expectations or legal requirements, we could lose sales
opportunities or face regulatory or legal actions.

We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. We
are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a
wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new
product releases such as Windows, AI services, significant business
transactions, warranty or product claims, employment practices, and
regulation. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in
significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect
our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are
subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may
change in the future. A material adverse impact in our consolidated financial
statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable
outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.

Our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties.
We derive substantial revenue from government contracts. Government contracts
generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial
agreements. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and
investigations relating to these contracts, we could be suspended or debarred
as a governmental contractor, we could incur civil and criminal fines and
penalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. Some
agreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for
higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may be subject to
periodic funding approval, reductions, cancellations, or delays which could
adversely impact public-sector demand for our products and services. These
events could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition,
and reputation.

We may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the
U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in
determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our
business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax
determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the 2017 United
States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA") and possible future legislative changes
may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the
company, the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements, and
the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As
regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the TCJA or possible future
legislative changes, and as we gather more information and perform more
analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially
affect our consolidated financial statements.

We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions.
Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates
are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have
taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue
in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more
difficult. We are currently under Internal Revenue Service audit for prior tax
years, with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing. The
final resolution of those audits, and other audits or litigation, may differ
from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may
materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or
periods in which that determination is made.

We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S. A change
in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax
rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes
about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher
effective tax rates for the company. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and
state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other
fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries,
including in the U.S., and changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative
interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely
impact our consolidated financial statements.

Item 1A

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS

We face risks related to the protection and utilization of our intellectual
property that may result in our business and operating results may be harmed.
Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying
and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is
difficult. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more
difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights.

Changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of
patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents.
Additionally, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations
to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations.
Finally, our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause
us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations.
If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our revenue may be
adversely affected.

Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other
software programs, is critical to our business. If our source code leaks, we
might lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become
easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying
functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating results.
Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks
described elsewhere in these risk factors.

Third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property. From
time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. To
resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on
terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or
redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy
indemnification commitments with our customers. Adverse outcomes could also
include monetary damages or injunctive relief that may limit or prevent
importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have
infringing technologies. We have paid significant amounts to settle claims
related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to
procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this
risk, and may continue to do so.

GENERAL RISKS

If our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating
results may be harmed. Our reputation and brands are globally recognized and
are important to our business. Our reputation and brands affect our ability to
attract and retain consumer, business, and public-sector customers. There are
numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. These include product
safety or quality issues, our environmental impact and sustainability, supply
chain practices, or human rights record. We may experience backlash from
customers, government entities, advocacy groups, employees, and other
stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public
policy positions. Damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among
other things:

•

The introduction of new features, products, services, or terms of service that
customers, users, or partners do not like.

•

Public scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, or
content.

•

Data security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners or
individual employees.

The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and
magnitude of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are damaged,
it could negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the
most highly qualified employees.

Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business. Worsening
economic conditions, including inflation, recession, pandemic, or other
changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely
affect our revenue. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices
declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our
revenue will be adversely affected.

Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail
network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also been a
significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our
partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer,
could cause sales channel disruption.

Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers
to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, allowances
for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.

Item 1A

We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and
maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity,
market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns
or events that affect global financial markets. A significant part of our
investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global financial
markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S.
government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government
debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could
determine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair
value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our
consolidated financial statements.

Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business. A
disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major
earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other
catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services,
or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a
significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain
other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and
we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California,
both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that
results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT
systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids,
could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our
customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the
resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management
plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages in our
consolidated financial statements.

Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict, such as the
ongoing conflict in Ukraine, pose a risk of general economic disruption in
affected countries, which may increase our operating costs and negatively
impact our ability to sell to and collect from customers in affected markets.
These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for
technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain
disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in
changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that
could impact our operating strategies, access to national, regional, and
global markets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead
to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with
some public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively impact our
revenues.

The occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as COVID-19,
may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of
operations. The extent to which global pandemics impact our business going
forward will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the pandemic;
governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic;
and the impact on economic activity, including the possibility of recession or
financial market instability. Measures to contain a global pandemic may
intensify other risks described in these Risk Factors.

We may incur increased costs to effectively manage these aspects of our
business. If we are unsuccessful, it may adversely impact our revenues, cash
flows, market share growth, and reputation.

The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT
industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in
the supply, demand, or available sources of energy or other resources may
affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural
resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in climate where we operate
may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to
develop software and provide cloud-based services.

PART I

Item 1A

Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our
customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our
revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business
creates operational, economic, and geopolitical risks. Our results of
operations may be affected by global, regional, and local economic
developments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession, as well as political
and military disputes. In addition, our international growth strategy includes
certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks,
including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in
a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign
operations. Emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about
human rights, the environment, and political expression in specific countries
may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments. Changes to
trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic
nationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-
local sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, or
other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign
countries. Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could
negatively impact demand for our products and services, impair our ability to
operate in certain regions, or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a
portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may
adversely affect our results of operations.

Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.
Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented
employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The
market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely
competitive. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and
inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are
important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. We are also limited
in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration
laws. Changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical
and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our
research and development efforts. If we are less successful in our recruiting
efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our
ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be
adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our
long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and
smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning
and execution. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our
workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less
flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. Our global workforce is
predominantly non-unionized, although we do have some employees in the U.S.
and internationally who are represented by unions or works councils. In the
U.S., there has been a general increase in workers exercising their right to
form or join a union. The unionization of significant employee populations
could result in higher costs and other operational changes necessary to
respond to changing conditions and to establish new relationships with worker
representatives.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations ("MD&A") is intended to help the reader understand the
results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A
is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our
consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial
Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). This section generally
discusses the results of our operations for the year ended June 30, 2023
compared to the year ended June 30, 2022. For a discussion of the year ended
June 30, 2022 compared to the year ended June 30, 2021, please refer to Part
II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
June 30, 2022.

OVERVIEW

Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and
every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local
opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. We are
creating the platforms and tools, powered by artificial intelligence ("AI"),
that deliver better, faster, and more effective solutions to support small and
large business competitiveness, improve educational and health outcomes, grow
public-sector efficiency, and empower human ingenuity.

We generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based solutions,
content, and other services to people and businesses; licensing and supporting
an array of software products; delivering relevant online advertising to a
global audience; and designing and selling devices. Our most significant
expenses are related to compensating employees; supporting and investing in
our cloud-based services, including datacenter operations; designing,
manufacturing, marketing, and selling our other products and services; and
income taxes.

Highlights from fiscal year 2023 compared with fiscal year 2022 included:

•

Microsoft Cloud revenue increased 22% to $111.6 billion.

•

Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 10% driven by
Office 365 Commercial growth of 13%.

•

Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 2% and Microsoft
365 Consumer subscribers increased to 67.0 million.

•

LinkedIn revenue increased 10%.

•

Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 16% driven by Dynamics
365 growth of 24%.

•

Server products and cloud services revenue increased 19% driven by Azure and
other cloud services growth of 29%.

•

Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing ("Windows OEM") revenue
decreased 25%.

•

Devices revenue decreased 24%.

•

Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 5%.

•

Xbox content and services revenue decreased 3%.

•

Search and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs
increased 11%.

Industry Trends

Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both
technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to
conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further
transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries
of what is possible through a broad range of research and development
activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers
and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.

PART II

Item 7

Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks

The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and
highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices,
while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and
businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly,
influencing how users access services in the cloud and, in some cases, the
user's choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand
for our software, services, and devices is also correlated to global
macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. We must continue
to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing
environment.

The investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will
continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating
margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our
datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving
needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services.
Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land,
predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics
processing units ("GPUs") and other components. Our devices are primarily
manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our
products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor
becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our
products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified
suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to
manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.

Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified
employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We
compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working
environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow
one's career across many different products and businesses, and competitive
compensation and benefits.

Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total
revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign
exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in
the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported
revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2023.

On January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost
structure with our revenue and customer demand, prioritize our investments in
strategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we recorded a $1.2
billion charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 ("Q2 charge"), which
included employee severance expenses of $800 million, impairment charges
resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease
consolidation activities. First, we reduced our overall workforce by
approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023
related to the Q2 charge, which represents less than 5% of our total employee
base. While we eliminated roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key
strategic areas. Second, we are allocating both our capital and talent to
areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness, while divesting in
other areas. Third, we are consolidating our leases to create higher density
across our workspaces, which impacted our financial results through the
remainder of fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in future
periods as we continue to evaluate our real estate needs.

Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of
these factors and other risks.

Seasonality

Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and
fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven by
corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season
spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of
multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.

Change in Accounting Estimate

In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and
network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased efficiencies
in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in
technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of
both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in
accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the
carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and
equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for
fiscal year 2023 was an increase in operating income of $3.7 billion and net
income of $3.0 billion, or $0.40 per both basic and diluted share.

Reportable Segments

We report our financial performance based on the following segments:
Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal
Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis
consistent with our internal management reporting. We have recast certain
prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor
our business.

Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 19 -
Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements
(Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).

Metrics

We use metrics in assessing the performance of our business and to make
informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources. We disclose metrics
to enable investors to evaluate progress against our ambitions, provide
transparency into performance trends, and reflect the continued evolution of
our products and services. Our commercial and other business metrics are
fundamentally connected based on how customers use our products and services.
The metrics are disclosed in the MD&A or the Notes to Financial Statements
(Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Financial metrics are calculated based on
financial results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), and growth comparisons
relate to the corresponding period of last fiscal year.

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, we made updates to the presentation
and method of calculation for certain metrics, most notably expanding our
Surface metric into a broader Devices metric to incorporate additional revenue
streams, along with other minor changes to align with how we manage our
businesses.

Commercial

Our commercial business primarily consists of Server products and cloud
services, Office Commercial, Windows Commercial, the commercial portion of
LinkedIn, Enterprise Services, and Dynamics. Our commercial metrics allow
management and investors to assess the overall health of our commercial
business and include leading indicators of future performance.

Adjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per
share ("EPS") are non-GAAP financial measures. Current year non-GAAP financial
measures exclude the impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee
severance expenses, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware
portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. Prior year
non-GAAP financial measures exclude the net income tax benefit related to
transfer of intangible properties in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022.
Refer to Note 12 - Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II,
Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Refer to the Non-GAAP
Financial Measures section below for a reconciliation of our financial results
reported in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP financial results.

Fiscal Year 2023 Compared with Fiscal Year 2022

Revenue increased $13.6 billion or 7% driven by growth in Intelligent Cloud
and Productivity and Business Processes, offset in part by a decline in More
Personal Computing. Intelligent Cloud revenue increased driven by Azure and
other cloud services. Productivity and Business Processes revenue increased
driven by Office 365 Commercial and LinkedIn. More Personal Computing revenue
decreased driven by Windows and Devices.

Cost of revenue increased $3.2 billion or 5% driven by growth in Microsoft
Cloud, offset in part by the change in accounting estimate.

Gross margin increased $10.4 billion or 8% driven by growth in Intelligent
Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes and the change in accounting
estimate, offset in part by a decline in More Personal Computing.

•

Gross margin percentage increased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change
in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased 1 point driven by
declines in Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing, offset in part by
sales mix shift between our segments.

•

Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased 2 points to 72%. Excluding
the impact of the change in accounting estimate, Microsoft Cloud gross margin
percentage decreased slightly driven by a decline in Azure and other cloud
services and sales mix shift to Azure and other cloud services, offset in part
by improvement in Office 365 Commercial.

Operating expenses increased $5.3 billion or 10% driven by employee severance
expenses, 2 points of growth from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions,
investments in cloud engineering, and LinkedIn.

Operating income increased $5.1 billion or 6% driven by growth in Productivity
and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and the change in accounting
estimate, offset in part by a decline in More Personal Computing.

Revenue, gross margin, and operating income included an unfavorable foreign
currency impact of 4%, 4%, and 6%, respectively. Cost of revenue and operating
expenses both included a favorable foreign currency impact of 2%.

Current year gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS were
negatively impacted by the Q2 charge, which resulted in decreases of $152
million, $1.2 billion, $946 million, and $0.13, respectively. Prior year net
income and diluted EPS were positively impacted by the net tax benefit related
to the transfer of intangible properties, which resulted in an increase to net
income and diluted EPS of $3.3 billion and $0.44, respectively.

We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies,
equity prices, interest rates, and credit; enhance investment returns; and
facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses from changes in fair
values of derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are
primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.

Fiscal Year 2023 Compared with Fiscal Year 2022

Interest and dividends income increased due to higher yields, offset in part
by lower portfolio balances. Interest expense decreased due to a decrease in
outstanding long-term debt due to debt maturities. Net recognized gains on
investments decreased due to lower gains on equity securities and higher
losses on fixed income securities. Net losses on derivatives increased due to
losses related to managing strategic investments.

INCOME TAXES

Effective Tax Rate

Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2023 and 2022 was 19% and 13%,
respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a
$3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022
related to the transfer of intangible properties and a decrease in tax
benefits relating to stock-based compensation.

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible
properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U.S. The transfer of
intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the
first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions
exceeded the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed
income tax.

Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate,
primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions
resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through
our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.

The mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries
impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of,
and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2023, our
U.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign income
before income taxes was $36.4 billion. In fiscal year 2022, our U.S. income
before income taxes was $47.8 billion and our foreign income before income
taxes was $35.9 billion.

Uncertain Tax Positions

We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") audit for tax
years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its
2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to
2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a
portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a
portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In
the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of
the IRS audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion,
including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017.

48

* * *

PART II

Item 7

As of June 30, 2023, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate
to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated
financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances
for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed
assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues. We do not expect a
final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the
information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase
or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12
months.

We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our
operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax
years 1996 to 2022, some of which are currently under audit by local tax
authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be
material to our consolidated financial statements.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Adjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS are non-
GAAP financial measures. Current year non-GAAP financial measures exclude the
impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee severance expenses,
impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs
related to lease consolidation activities. Prior year non-GAAP financial
measures exclude the net income tax benefit related to transfer of intangible
properties in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. We believe these non-GAAP
measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational
performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability
of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP
financial results in evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial
measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to,
the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance
with GAAP to non-GAAP financial results:

Item 7

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows
from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to
fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing
activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material
capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act ("TCJA"), for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the
foreseeable future.

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments

Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $111.3 billion and
$104.8 billion as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Equity investments
were $9.9 billion and $6.9 billion as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and
capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-
grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual
issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities,
but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk.
Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit
risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are
managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income
indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant
given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid
investment-grade fixed-income securities.

Valuation

In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial
instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such
as U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds.
If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not
available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar
assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are
observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to
our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit,
U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed
securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3
investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable
inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis
using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.

A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally
Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market
price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without
applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted
price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors,
or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in
which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally
classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments
based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition,
all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to
demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments.
Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure
appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation,
review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and
independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.

Cash Flows

Cash from operations decreased $1.5 billion to $87.6 billion for fiscal year
2023, mainly due to an increase in cash paid to employees and suppliers and
cash used to pay income taxes, offset in part by an increase in cash received
from customers. Cash used in financing decreased $14.9 billion to $43.9
billion for fiscal year 2023, mainly due to a $10.5 billion decrease in common
stock repurchases and a $6.3 billion decrease in repayments of debt, offset in
part by a $1.7 billion increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing
decreased $7.6 billion to $22.7 billion for fiscal year 2023, due to a $20.4
billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash
acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, offset in part by a
$8.2 billion decrease in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and
maturities, and a $4.2 billion increase in additions to property and
equipment.

Item 7

Debt Proceeds

We issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt
markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment.
The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate
purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital,
capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and
repayment of existing debt. Refer to Note 11 - Debt of the Notes to Financial
Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.

Unearned Revenue

Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing
programs, which may include Software Assurance ("SA") and cloud services.
Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each
contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the
coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings
for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer
control of the product or service. Refer to Note 1 - Accounting Policies of
the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for
further discussion.

If our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and
services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the
associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the
transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon
consumption, as applicable. Refer to Note 13 - Unearned Revenue of the Notes

Item 7

Income Taxes

As a result of the TCJA, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax on
deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax. Under the
TCJA, the transition tax is payable in interest-free installments over eight
years, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in
year seven, and 25% in year eight. We have paid transition tax of $7.7
billion, which included $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2023. The remaining
transition tax of $10.5 billion is payable over the next three years, with
$2.7 billion payable within 12 months.

In fiscal year 2023, we paid cash tax of $4.8 billion due to the mandatory
capitalization for tax purposes of research and development expenditures
enacted by the TCJA and effective on July 1, 2022.

Share Repurchases

During fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we repurchased 69 million shares and 95
million shares of our common stock for $18.4 billion and $28.0 billion,
respectively, through our share repurchase programs. All repurchases were made
using cash resources. As of June 30, 2023, $22.3 billion remained of our $60
billion share repurchase program. Refer to Note 16 - Stockholders' Equity of
the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for
further discussion.

Dividends

During fiscal year 2023 and 2022, our Board of Directors declared quarterly
dividends of $0.68 per share and $0.62 per share, totaling $20.2 billion and
$18.6 billion, respectively. We intend to continue returning capital to
shareholders in the form of dividends, subject to declaration by our Board of
Directors. Refer to Note 16 - Stockholders' Equity of the Notes to Financial
Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.

Other Planned Uses of Capital

On January 18, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire
Activision Blizzard, Inc. ("Activision Blizzard") for $95.00 per share in an
all-cash transaction valued at $68.7 billion, inclusive of Activision
Blizzard's net cash. The acquisition has been approved by Activision
Blizzard's shareholders. We continue to work toward closing the transaction
subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other
customary closing conditions. Microsoft and Activision Blizzard have jointly
agreed to extend the merger agreement through October 18, 2023 to allow for
additional time to resolve remaining regulatory concerns.

We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support
infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as
acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and
equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer
systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and
administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming
years to support growth in our cloud offerings and our investments in AI
infrastructure. We have operating and finance leases for datacenters,
corporate offices, research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience
Centers, and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party
transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons
that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability
of capital resources.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in
accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates
are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty
and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of
operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue
recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and
development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and
inventories.

PART II

Item 7

Revenue Recognition

Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple
products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services
are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for
separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-
based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services,
judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered
distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for
together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud
services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration,
interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud
services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation.
Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the
cloud services are provided.

Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price ("SSP") for
each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP
for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold
with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range
of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services
separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated
based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.

In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell
the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that
may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have
more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the
stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances.
In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer
and geographic region in determining the SSP.

Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is
required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of
certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.

Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other
credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of
our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration
when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are
estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting
period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated
variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.

Impairment of Investment Securities

We review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the
cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other
factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers,
and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. This determination
requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic
methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in
evaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider
specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business
outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more
likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery,
then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in
other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is
established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we
may incur future impairments.

Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down
to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is
impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We
perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to
estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the
impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an
impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net.

53

* * *

PART II

Item 7

Goodwill

We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected
to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on
an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair
value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting
unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an
annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or
circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of
a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could
include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating
performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant
portion of a reporting unit.

Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the
identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to
reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination
of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting
unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow
methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including
estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts,
estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the
useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our
weighted average cost of capital.

The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from
year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors.
Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the
determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.

Research and Development Costs

Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software
product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been
established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established,
software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general
release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological
feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological
feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk
development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally,
this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The
amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated
life of the products.

Legal and Other Contingencies

The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to
significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a
legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable
that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss
should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability
of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the
amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our
consolidated financial statements.

54

* * *

PART II

Item 7

Income Taxes

The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of
taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities
and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized
in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax
benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that
the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities,
based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in
the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the
largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon
ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on
derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred
income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties
associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is
required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been
recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations
in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact
our consolidated financial statements.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net
realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead
related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is
the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and
transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future
purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our
inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life
cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing
strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in
utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis
through a charge to cost of revenue.

STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements and related information that are presented in this report. The
consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management's
estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to
provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded
against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial
records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and
maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are augmented by written
policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities,
careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of
internal audits.

The Company engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States).

The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of
independent directors of the Company, meets periodically with management,
internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to
ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters
concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP
and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit
Committee.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

RISKS

We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates,
credit risk, and equity prices. We use derivatives instruments to manage these
risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements.

Foreign Currencies

Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to
foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to
maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions,
including hedges. Principal currency exposures include the Euro, Japanese yen,
British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar.

Interest Rate

Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different
interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity
of the fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to
certain global fixed-income indices.

Credit

Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of
investment-grade securities. We manage credit exposures relative to broad-
based indices to facilitate portfolio diversification.

Equity

Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to price risk.

Item 8

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 -- ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Accounting Principles

Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America ("GAAP").

We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period
presentation. The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our
consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated
cash flows statements.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft
Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have
been eliminated.

Estimates and Assumptions

Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue,
and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue
recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance
obligations, and determining the standalone selling price ("SSP") of
performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as
product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair
value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our
reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and
intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and
demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when
technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome
of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated
financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of
impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from
management's estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.

In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and
network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased efficiencies
in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in
technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of
both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in
accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the
carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and
equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for
fiscal year 2023 was an increase in operating income of $3.7 billion and net
income of $3.0 billion, or $0.40 per both basic and diluted share.

Foreign Currencies

Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the
exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated
at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation
adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive
income.

Revenue

Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue

Product revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device
productivity and collaboration applications, server applications, business
solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software
development tools, video games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and
entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.

Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that
provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as
Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox; solution support; and consulting
services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online
advertising and LinkedIn.

63

* * *

PART II

Item 8

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect
to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts
that can include various combinations of products and services, which are
generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance
obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes
collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental
authorities.

Nature of Products and Services

Licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the
software as it exists when made available to the customer. Customers may
purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers
with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the
customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises
licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made
available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software
updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge,
revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably
over the estimated life of the related device or license.

Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include
on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance ("SA"). SA conveys
rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and
provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use
products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct
performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is
generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers
simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct
performance obligations that are satisfied over time.

Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract
period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a
subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided
on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period.
Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the
amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer
utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a significant level
of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components
are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in
which the cloud services are provided.

Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears
in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has
been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are
provided.

Our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the
underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system.
In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a
single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time
when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers
through retail stores and online marketplaces.

Refer to Note 19 - Segment Information and Geographic Data for further
information, including revenue by significant product and service offering.

Significant Judgments

Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple
products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services
are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for
separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-
based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services,
judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered
distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for
together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud
services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration,
interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud
services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation.
Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the
cloud services are provided.

64

* * *

PART II

Item 8

Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance
obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold
separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates
provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP
when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to
determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative
SSP of the various products and services.

In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell
the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that
may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have
more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the
stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances.
In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer
and geographic region in determining the SSP.

Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is
required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of
certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.

Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other
credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of
our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration
when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are
estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting
period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated
variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.

Contract Balances and Other Receivables

Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to
customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to
invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to
invoicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually
at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable
related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have
an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to
those licenses.

Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing
programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is
generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for
multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period.
Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be
performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions,
Xbox subscriptions, Windows post-delivery support, Dynamics business
solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn
the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.

Refer to Note 13 - Unearned Revenue for further information, including
unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period.

Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally
include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the
timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have
determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing
component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers
with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services,
not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with
financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term
with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-
premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.

As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance
for doubtful accounts, was $4.5 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, and is
included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable
losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance
based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently
available evidence.

As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, other receivables related to activities to
facilitate the purchase of server components were $9.2 billion and $6.1
billion, respectively, and are included in other current assets in our
consolidated balance sheets.

We record financing receivables when we offer certain of our customers the
option to acquire our software products and services offerings through a
financing program in a limited number of countries. As of June 30, 2023 and
2022, our financing receivables, net were $5.3 billion and $4.1 billion,
respectively, for short-term and long-term financing receivables, which are
included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our
consolidated balance sheets. We record an allowance to cover expected losses
based on troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently
available evidence.

Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer

We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a
customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year.
We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements
to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were
immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and
long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

We apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to
obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been
one year or less. These costs include our internal sales organization
compensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have
determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities.

Cost of Revenue

Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products
sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service
centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software
on PCs sold by original equipment manufacturers ("OEM"), to drive traffic to
our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to
support and maintain cloud-based and other online products and services,
including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation
adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and
the amortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized
software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the
products.

66

* * *

PART II

Item 8

Product Warranty

We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under
hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is
recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical
and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs,
and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware
warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the
country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a
period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties,
we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the
estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to
assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the
amounts as necessary.

Research and Development

Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-
based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated
with product development. Research and development expenses also include
third-party development and programming costs and the amortization of
purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software
development are included in research and development expense until the point
that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is
generally shortly before the products are released to production. Once
technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized
to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.

Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based
compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with
sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade
shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as
incurred. Advertising expense was $904 million, $1.5 billion, and $1.5 billion
in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation

Compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units
("RSUs") and performance stock units ("PSUs"), is measured at the fair value
on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures,
over the related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards
is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the
present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We
measure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model.
Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straight-line method and
for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method.

Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP") is measured
as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in
the period of purchase.

Employee Severance

On January 18, 2023, we announced a decision to reduce our overall workforce
by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $800 million of
employee severance expenses related to these job eliminations as part of an
ongoing employee benefit plan. These employee severance expenses were incurred
as part of a corporate program, and were included in general and
administrative expenses in our consolidated income statements and allocated to
our segments based on relative gross margin. Refer to Note 19 - Segment
Information and Geographic Data for further information.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest
and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not
reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax
effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes.
Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more
likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income
taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets.

67

* * *

PART II

Item 8

Financial Instruments

Investments

We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of
three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair
values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general,
investments with original maturities of greater than three months and
remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term
investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as
short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable
securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current
operations.

Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and
losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in fair
value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other
comprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available
market information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of
an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors,
general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the
extent to which the fair value is less than cost. To determine credit losses,
we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and
qualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions
related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If
we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will
be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value
below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net
and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry,
and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.

Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair
value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are
measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for
observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement
alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and
recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value
of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded
in other income (expense), net.

Derivatives

Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and
measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a
derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting
designation.

For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses
are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and losses
on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded
from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense),
net.

For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses
are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and
subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding
hedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the
assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.

For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses
from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income
(expense), net.

Item 8

Fair Value Measurements

We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy
below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs
used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each
of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its
entirety. These levels are:

•

Level 1 - inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical
instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments include U.S. government
securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1
derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges.

•

Level 2 - inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in
active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets
that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-
Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market
or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full
term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project
future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using
market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads,
foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level
2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency
securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities,
corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative
assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap contracts and over-the-
counter forward, option, and swap contracts.

•

Level 3 - inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's
estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the
asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based
techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models.
Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and
bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are
recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used
in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and
liabilities.

We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a
nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are determined based
on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include
quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow
projections.

Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair
values that approximate their carrying values.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net
realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead
related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is
the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and
transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future
purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our
inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying
value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of
revenue.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and
depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated
useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our
property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed
or acquired for internal use, three years; computer equipment, two to six
years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements,
three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not
depreciated.

Leases

We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are
included in operating lease right-of-use ("ROU") assets, other current
liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance
sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current
liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance
sheets.

69

* * *

PART II

Item 8

ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term
and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising
from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at
commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease
term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use
our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for
collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at
commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease
payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include
options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we
will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the lease term.

We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are
generally accounted for separately. For certain equipment leases, such as
vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease
component. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio
approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and
liabilities.

Goodwill

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating
segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1)
and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would
more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its
carrying value.

Intangible Assets

Our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the
straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one
to 20 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically
by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised
estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.

NOTE 2 -- EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed based on the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is
computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus
the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period
using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include
outstanding stock options and stock awards.

The components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows:

(a)

Refer to Note 5 - Derivatives for further information on the fair value of our
derivative instruments.

Equity investments presented as "Other" in the tables above include
investments without readily determinable fair values measured using the equity
method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or
impairments, and investments measured at fair value using net asset value as a
practical expedient which are not categorized in the fair value hierarchy. As
of June 30, 2023 and 2022, equity investments without readily determinable
fair values measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price
or impairments were $4.2 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively.

Unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to
changes in interest rates. Management does not believe any remaining
unrealized losses represent impairments based on our evaluation of available
evidence.

PART II

Item 8

NOTE 5 -- DERIVATIVES

We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies,
interest rates, equity prices, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and
to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding
derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the
economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative
programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge
accounting treatment.

Foreign Currencies

Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to
foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to
maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions.

Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated
investments are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are
designated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related
to certain Euro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward
contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments.

Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also
used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance
sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.

Interest Rate

Interest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using
interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedging instruments to
effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.

Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different
interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity
of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to
certain broad-based fixed-income indices using option, futures, and swap
contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are
included in "Other contracts" in the tables below.

Equity

Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market
price risk. At times, we may hold options, futures, and swap contracts. These
contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.

Credit

Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of
investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts to manage
credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio
diversification. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and
are included in "Other contracts" in the tables below.

Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features

Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain
provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to
maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum
liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements,
we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention
related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2023, our long-term
unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0
billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted.

During fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, depreciation expense was $11.0
billion, $12.6 billion, and $9.3 billion, respectively. Depreciation expense
declined in fiscal year 2023 due to the change in estimated useful lives of
our server and network equipment.

As of June 30, 2023, we have committed $13.5 billion for the construction of
new buildings, building improvements, and leasehold improvements, primarily
related to datacenters.

all-cash transaction valued at $68.7 billion, inclusive of Activision
Blizzard's net cash. Activision Blizzard is a leader in game development and

PART II

Item 8

The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed
as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months.
Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts
allocated to goodwill during the periods in which the adjustments are
determined.

Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency
translations and purchase accounting adjustments are presented as "Other" in
the table above. Also included in "Other" are business dispositions and
transfers between segments due to reorganizations, as applicable.

Goodwill Impairment

We test goodwill for impairment annually on May 1 at the reporting unit level,
primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, risk-
adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We believe use of a discounted cash
flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the
businesses.

No instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2023, May 1, 2022, or
May 1, 2021 tests. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, accumulated goodwill
impairment was $11.3 billion.

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible
properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U.S. The transfer of
intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the
first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions
exceeded the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed
income ("GILTI") tax.

We have historically paid India withholding taxes on software sales through
distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in India. In March 2021, the
India Supreme Court ruled favorably in the case of Engineering Analysis Centre
of Excellence Private Limited vs The Commissioner of Income Tax for companies
in 86 separate appeals, some dating back to 2012, holding that software sales
are not subject to India withholding taxes. Although we were not a party to
the appeals, our software sales in India were determined to be not subject to
withholding taxes. Therefore, we recorded a net income tax benefit of $620
million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the
India Supreme Court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year
2016.

The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2023 is primarily
due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from
producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign
regional operations center in Ireland. The decrease from the federal statutory
rate in fiscal year 2022 is primarily due to the net income tax benefit
related to the transfer of intangible properties, earnings taxed at lower
rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our
products and services through our foreign regional operations center in
Ireland, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. The decrease
from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2021 is primarily due to
earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from
producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign
regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, tax benefits relating
to stock-based compensation, and tax benefits from the India Supreme Court
decision on withholding taxes. In fiscal year 2023, our foreign regional
operating center in Ireland, which is taxed at a rate lower than the U.S.
rate, generated 81% of our foreign income before tax. In fiscal years 2022 and
2021, our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, which
are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate, generated 71% and 82% of our
foreign income before tax. Other reconciling items, net consists primarily of
tax credits and GILTI tax, and in fiscal year 2021, includes tax benefits from
the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes. In fiscal years 2023,
2022, and 2021, there were no individually significant other reconciling
items.

PART II

Item 8

The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal
year 2022 was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the
first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible
properties and a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock-based
compensation. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022
compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income
tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer
of intangible properties, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income
before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries, as well as tax
benefits in the prior year from the India Supreme Court decision on
withholding taxes, an agreement between the U.S. and India tax authorities
related to transfer pricing, and final Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA")
regulations.

(a)

Provisions enacted in the TCJA related to the capitalization for tax purposes
of research and development expenditures became effective on July 1, 2022.
These provisions require us to capitalize research and development
expenditures and amortize them on our U.S. tax return over five or fifteen
years, depending on where research is conducted.

Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and
are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are
paid or recovered.

As of June 30, 2023, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss
carryforwards of $509 million, $1.2 billion, and $2.3 billion, respectively.
The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards have varying expiration
dates ranging from fiscal year 2024 to 2043 or indefinite carryforward
periods, if not utilized. The majority of our foreign net operating loss
carryforwards do not expire. Certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards
are subject to an annual limitation but are expected to be realized with the
exception of those which have a valuation allowance. As of June 30, 2023, we
had $456 million federal capital loss carryforwards for U.S. tax purposes from
our acquisition of Nuance. The federal capital loss carryforwards are subject
to an annual limitation and will expire in fiscal year 2025.

84

PART II

Item 8

The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign
net operating loss carryforwards, federal capital loss carryforwards, and
other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized.

Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $23.1 billion, $16.0 billion, and
$13.4 billion in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

Uncertain Tax Positions

Gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as of June
30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, were $17.1 billion, $15.6 billion, and $14.6
billion, respectively, which were primarily included in long-term income taxes
in our consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the resulting tax benefit
would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021 by
$14.4 billion, $13.3 billion, and $12.5 billion, respectively.

As of June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we had accrued interest expense related
to uncertain tax positions of $5.2 billion, $4.3 billion, and $4.3 billion,
respectively, net of income tax benefits. The provision for income taxes for
fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021 included interest expense related to
uncertain tax positions of $918 million, $36 million, and $274 million,
respectively, net of income tax benefits.

The aggregate changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to
uncertain tax positions were as follows:

We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") audit for tax
years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its
2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to
2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a
portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a
portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In
the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of
the IRS audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion,
including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017.

As of June 30, 2023, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate
to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated
financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances
for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed
assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues. We do not expect a
final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the
information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase
or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12
months.

We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our
operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax
years 1996 to 2022, some of which are currently under audit by local tax
authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be
material to our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations, which includes
unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue
in future periods, was $229 billion as of June 30, 2023, of which $224 billion
is related to the commercial portion of revenue. We expect to recognize
approximately 45% of this revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder
thereafter.

NOTE 14 -- LEASES

We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices,
research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain
equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of less than 1 year to 18
years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 5 years,
and some of which include options to terminate the leases within 1 year.

Item 8

NOTE 15 -- CONTINGENCIES

U.S. Cell Phone Litigation

Microsoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft, along with other handset
manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 46 lawsuits, including
45 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by
individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets
caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We assumed
responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia's Devices
and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine
of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial
proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect
claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S.
Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines ("FCC
Guidelines") are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their
handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured
before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an
industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission
guidelines.

In 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the
plaintiffs' expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed
scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied
in part the defendants' motion to exclude the plaintiffs' general causation
experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of
Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert
scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision
adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to
the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs
have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by
the court. A hearing on general causation took place in September of 2022. In
April of 2023, the court granted defendants' motion to strike the testimony of
plaintiffs' experts that cell phones cause brain cancer and entered an order
excluding all of plaintiffs' experts from testifying.

Irish Data Protection Commission Matter

In 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission ("IDPC") began investigating a
complaint against LinkedIn as to whether LinkedIn's targeted advertising
practices violated the recently implemented European Union General Data
Protection Regulation ("GDPR"). Microsoft cooperated throughout the period of
inquiry. In April 2023, the IDPC provided LinkedIn with a non-public
preliminary draft decision alleging GDPR violations and proposing a fine.
Microsoft intends to challenge the preliminary draft decision. There is no set
timeline for the IDPC to issue a final decision.

Other Contingencies

We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from
time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management
currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in
aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated
financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and
management's view of these matters may change in the future.

As of June 30, 2023, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $617 million.
While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we
estimate could reach approximately $600 million in aggregate beyond recorded
amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur,
there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated
financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably
estimable.

Executive Incentive Plan

Under the Executive Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee approves stock
awards to executive officers and certain senior executives. RSUs generally
vest ratably over a service period of four years. PSUs generally vest over a
performance period of three years. The number of shares the PSU holder
receives is based on the extent to which the corresponding performance goals
have been achieved.

Activity for All Stock Plans

The fair value of stock awards was estimated on the date of grant using the
following assumptions:

Savings Plans

We have savings plans in the U.S. that qualify under Section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code, and a number of savings plans in international
locations. Eligible U.S. employees may contribute a portion of their salary
into the savings plans, subject to certain limitations. We match a portion of
each dollar a participant contributes into the plans. Employer-funded
retirement benefits for all plans were $1.6 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.2
billion in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, and were expensed
as contributed.

NOTE 19 -- SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating
decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer, reviews certain
financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements
prepared on a basis not consistent with GAAP. During the periods presented, we
reported our financial performance based on the following segments:
Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal
Computing.

We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we
internally manage and monitor our business.

Our reportable segments are described below.

Productivity and Business Processes

Our Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and
services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information
services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily
comprises:

•

Office Commercial (Office 365 subscriptions, the Office 365 portion of
Microsoft 365 Commercial subscriptions, and Office licensed on-premises),
comprising Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Office 365 Security
and Compliance, Microsoft Viva, and Microsoft 365 Copilot.

•

Office Consumer, including Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions, Office
licensed on-premises, and other Office services.

•

LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium
Subscriptions, and Sales Solutions.

•

Dynamics business solutions, including Dynamics 365, comprising a set of
intelligent, cloud-based applications across ERP, CRM (including Customer
Insights), Power Apps, and Power Automate; and on-premises ERP and CRM
applications.

Intelligent Cloud

Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid
server products and cloud services that can power modern business and
developers. This segment primarily comprises:

•

Server products and cloud services, including Azure and other cloud services;
SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client
Access Licenses ("CALs"); and Nuance and GitHub.

•

Enterprise Services, including Enterprise Support Services, Industry Solutions
(formerly Microsoft Consulting Services), and Nuance professional services.

More Personal Computing

Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put
customers at the center of the experience with our technology. This segment
primarily comprises:

•

Windows, including Windows OEM licensing and other non-volume licensing of the
Windows operating system; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of
the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and other Windows
commercial offerings; patent licensing; and Windows Internet of Things.

•

Devices, including Surface, HoloLens, and PC accessories.

93

* * *

PART II

Item 8

•

Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising
first- and third-party content (including games and in-game content), Xbox
Game Pass and other subscriptions, Xbox Cloud Gaming, advertising, third-party
disc royalties, and other cloud services.

•

Search and news advertising, comprising Bing (including Bing Chat), Microsoft
News, Microsoft Edge, and third-party affiliates.

Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However,
due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized
and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from
certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value
of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on
actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a
profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a
relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily
include those relating to marketing of products and services from which
multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross
margin.

In addition, certain costs are incurred at a corporate level and allocated to
our segments. These allocated costs  generally include legal, including
settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance,
excise taxes, field selling, shared facilities services, customer service and
support, and severance incurred as part of a corporate program. Each
allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and
circumstances of the costs being allocated and is generally based on relative
gross margin or relative headcount.

Segment revenue and operating income were as follows during the periods
presented:

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Microsoft
Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the
related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows,
and stockholders' equity, for each of the three years in the period ended June
30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial
statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023
and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended June 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on criteria
established in Internal Control -- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated July 27, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the
current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)
involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by
communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on
the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they
relate.

Revenue Recognition - Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products
or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the
Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The
Company offers customers the ability to acquire multiple licenses of software
products and services, including cloud-based services, in its customer
agreements through its volume licensing programs.

96

* * *

PART II

Item 8

Significant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining revenue
recognition for these customer agreements, and includes the following:

•

Determination of whether products and services are considered distinct
performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus
together, such as software licenses and related services that are sold with
cloud-based services.

•

The pattern of delivery (i.e., timing of when revenue is recognized) for each
distinct performance obligation.

•

Identification and treatment of contract terms that may impact the timing and
amount of revenue recognized (e.g., variable consideration, optional
purchases, and free services).

•

Determination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct performance
obligation and for products and services that are not sold separately.

Given these factors and due to the volume of transactions, the related audit
effort in evaluating management's judgments in determining revenue recognition
for these customer agreements was extensive and required a high degree of
auditor judgment.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our principal audit procedures related to the Company's revenue recognition
for these customer agreements included the following:

|  
---|---  
  


|

We tested the effectiveness of controls related to the identification of
distinct performance obligations, the determination of the timing of revenue
recognition, and the estimation of variable consideration.  
  
|  
  


|

We evaluated management's significant accounting policies related to these
customer agreements for reasonableness.  
  
|  
  


|

We selected a sample of customer agreements and performed the following
procedures:  
  
|  
  
-

|

Obtained and read contract source documents for each selection, including
master agreements, and other documents that were part of the agreement.  
  
|  
  
-

|

Tested management's identification and treatment of contract terms.  
  
|  
  
-

|

Assessed the terms in the customer agreement and evaluated the appropriateness
of management's application of their accounting policies, along with their use
of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition conclusions.  
  
|  
  


|

We evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimate of stand-alone
selling prices for products and services that are not sold separately.  
  
|  
  


|

We tested the mathematical accuracy of management's calculations of revenue
and the associated timing of revenue recognized in the financial statements.  
  
Income Taxes - Uncertain Tax Positions - Refer to Note 12 to the financial
statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company's long-term income taxes liability includes uncertain tax
positions related to transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the
Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). The Company remains under IRS audit, or
subject to IRS audit, for tax years subsequent to 2003. While the Company has
settled a portion of the IRS audits, resolution of the remaining matters could
have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.

Conclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve
significant estimates and management judgment and include complex
considerations of the Internal Revenue Code, related regulations, tax case
laws, and prior-year audit settlements. Given the complexity and the
subjective nature of the transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with
the IRS, evaluating management's estimates relating to their determination of
uncertain tax positions required extensive audit effort and a high degree of
auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax specialists.

97

* * *

PART II

Item 8

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our principal audit procedures to evaluate management's estimates of uncertain
tax positions related to unresolved transfer pricing issues included the
following:

•

We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management's methods and
assumptions used in the identification, recognition, measurement, and
disclosure of uncertain tax positions, which included testing the
effectiveness of the related internal controls.

•

We read and evaluated management's documentation, including relevant
accounting policies and information obtained by management from outside tax
specialists, that detailed the basis of the uncertain tax positions.

•

We tested the reasonableness of management's judgments regarding the future
resolution of the uncertain tax positions, including an evaluation of the
technical merits of the uncertain tax positions.

•

For those uncertain tax positions that had not been effectively settled, we
evaluated whether management had appropriately considered new information that
could significantly change the recognition, measurement or disclosure of the
uncertain tax positions.

•

We evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimates by considering how
tax law, including statutes, regulations and case law, impacted management's
judgments.

Not applicable.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by
Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this
report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures
are effective.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control
over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our
transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary for preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing
reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made
in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable
assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets
that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements
would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to
provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated financial
statements would be prevented or detected.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management
concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of June 30, 2023. There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2023 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP has audited
our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023; their
report is included in Item 9A.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Microsoft
Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30, 2023, based on
criteria established in Internal Control -- Integrated Framework (2013) issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based
on criteria established in Internal Control -- Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial
statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023, of the Company and our
report dated July 27, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to
the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting
was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
