PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

Founded in 1982, Adobe is one of the largest and most diversified software
companies in the world. We offer a line of products and services used by
creative professionals, including photographers, video editors, graphic and
experience designers and game developers; communicators, including content
creators, students, marketers and knowledge workers; businesses of all sizes;
and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing,
engaging and transacting with compelling content and experiences across
personal computers, smartphones, other electronic devices and digital media
formats.

We market our products and services directly to enterprise customers through
our sales force and local field offices. We license our products to end users
through app stores and our own website at www.adobe.com. We offer many of our
products via a Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS") model or a managed services
model (both of which are referred to as hosted or cloud-based) as well as
through term subscription and pay-per-use models. We also distribute certain
products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers
("VARs"), systems integrators ("SIs"), independent software vendors ("ISVs"),
retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs").
In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software
developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our
products run on desktop and laptop computers, smartphones, tablets, other
devices and the web, depending on the product. We have operations in the
Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"); and Asia-Pacific ("APAC").

Adobe was originally incorporated in California in October 1983 and was
reincorporated in Delaware in May 1997\. Our executive offices and principal
facilities are located at 345 Park Avenue, San Jose, California 95110-2704.
Our telephone number is 408-536-6000 and our website is www.adobe.com.
Investors can obtain copies of our SEC filings from our website free of
charge, as well as from the SEC website at www.sec.gov. The information posted
to our website is not incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

OFFERINGS

For four decades, Adobe's innovations have transformed how individuals, teams,
businesses and governments engage and interact across all types of media. We
deliver tools and services to empower individuals to create, collaborate and
express their vision, transform businesses with compelling, personalized
experiences in streamlined workflows and connect communities with new levels
of collaboration.

While we continue to offer a broad portfolio of products, services and
solutions, we focus our investments in two areas of strategic growth:

Digital Media. We provide products, services and solutions that enable
individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish and promote their
content anywhere and accelerate their productivity by modernizing how they
view, share, engage with and collaborate on documents and creative content.
Our Digital Media segment is centered around Adobe Creative Cloud

Table of Contents

and Adobe Document Cloud, which include Adobe Express, Photoshop, Illustrator,
Lightroom, Premiere Pro, Acrobat, Adobe Acrobat Sign and many more products,
offering a variety of tools for creative professionals, communicators and
other consumers. This is the core of what we have delivered to users for
decades, and we have continually evolved and expanded our business model to
provide our customers with a range of flexible solutions that allow them to
reach their full creative potential anytime, anywhere, on any device and on
projects of all types.

Digital Experience. We provide an integrated platform and set of applications
and services through Adobe Experience Cloud that enable brands and businesses
to create, manage, execute, measure, monetize and optimize customer
experiences that span from analytics to commerce. Our customers include
marketers, advertisers, agencies, publishers, merchandisers, merchants, web
analysts, data scientists, developers and executives across the C-suite. The
foundation of our offering is Adobe Experience Platform, which provides
businesses and brands with an open and extensible system for customer
experience management that transforms customer data into robust customer
profiles that update in real time and uses insights driven by artificial
intelligence ("AI") to enable the delivery of personalized digital experiences
across various channels in milliseconds.

  

With the creative power of our Digital Media business and the data-based tools
of our Digital Experience business, we are able to offer a comprehensive suite
of offerings to our customers. Through these tools and services, we help our
customers effectively make, manage, monetize and mobilize their content across
channels and devices with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop. We believe
we are uniquely positioned to be a leader in both of these areas, where our
mission to change the world through digital experiences has never been more
relevant, as people seek new ways to create, collaborate and communicate and
businesses continue to invest in digital transformation. In addition, our
ability to deliver innovation and productivity improvements across customer
workflows involving the creation, management, delivery, measurement and
optimization of engaging content favorably positions Adobe as our customers
continue to invest in delivering digital experiences.

SEGMENTS

Our business is organized into three reportable segments:

•Digital Media;

•Digital Experience; and

•Publishing and Advertising.

These segments provide Adobe's senior management with a comprehensive
financial view of our key businesses. Our segments are aligned around our two
strategic growth opportunities further described below, and our legacy
products and solutions are contained within the third segment, Publishing and
Advertising.

MARKET OVERVIEW

This overview provides an explanation of our markets and a discussion of
strategic opportunities in fiscal 2023 and beyond for each of our segments.
See the section titled "Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 titled
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" of this report and Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further segment information.

Digital Media

Opportunity

In today's digital world, content is fueling the global economy and design and
creativity have never been more relevant, providing a significant market
opportunity for Adobe in digital media. Everyone has a story to tell, and they
need the tools, services and capabilities at their fingertips to tell those
stories on an ever-increasing number of canvasses. In a creator economy that
is continually expanding, creators are looking for tools to help them easily
make and share unique and beautiful content with speed and ease. At the same
time, creativity is increasingly a team sport that is redefining productivity,
making collaboration even more critical to every company's success. We believe
Adobe is in a strong position to address these trends with innovation that
will democratize creativity, empowering individuals to create wherever
inspiration strikes and enabling more effective collaboration between creators
and stakeholders.

The flagship of our Digital Media business is Adobe Creative Cloud, a
subscription service that allows members to use our creative products
integrated with cloud-delivered services across desktop, web and mobile
devices. We believe in creativity for all, and Creative Cloud addresses the
needs of all content creators, from creative professionals, such as artists,
designers, developers, students and administrators, to knowledge workers,
marketers, educators, enthusiasts, communicators and

4

Table of Contents

consumers. Users can choose between the speed and ease of use of Adobe
Express, our task-based, template-first web and mobile application, or the
greater power and precision of our flagship Creative Cloud applications. Our
customers rely on our products for content creation, photo editing, design,
video and animation production, mobile app and gaming development and more. We
believe we have significant opportunities to grow by advancing every creative
category across devices and the web, expanding content-first, task-based
creativity with Adobe Express and 3D and immersive content creation with
Substance 3D, enabling seamless collaboration across all stakeholders and
inspiring and empowering the creative community through sharing and
monetization.

Our Digital Media segment also includes our Adobe Document Cloud business, a
unified, cloud-based document services platform, which integrates Adobe's
pioneering PDF technology with our Acrobat and Adobe Acrobat Sign applications
to deliver fully digital document workflows. We have the opportunity to
continue to accelerate document productivity with Adobe Document Cloud,
modernizing how people view, share, collaborate and engage with documents.
Trillions of PDF documents are created every year, which reflects the growing
role PDF plays across practically every segment of the economy. There are
hundreds of millions of users that engage with PDF files on a daily basis, in
industries such as legal, financial services and publishing, as well as a
broader array of communicators and Acrobat Reader users, who can also use the
expanded capabilities provided by our Acrobat applications and the document
services platform found in Document Cloud.

Strategy

Our goal for our Digital Media business is to be the leading platform for
creativity and digital document solutions, where we offer a range of products
and services that allow individuals, teams, small and medium businesses,
enterprises and government institutions, including both professionals and
enthusiasts, to design and deliver content seamlessly. With content creation,
consumption, collaboration and monetization happening across all surfaces and
media types, we aim to deliver new ways to unleash creativity and accelerate
document productivity, and we believe this is an area of significant
opportunity for growth through expansion of our customer base. We aim to
achieve this by using data-driven customer engagement, driving product-led
growth to make our creative applications more frictionless and accessible, and
meeting customer needs holistically to increase the value of our products.

We continue to redefine the creative process with Creative Cloud, so that our
customers can connect with everything and everyone they need to create,
collaborate and be inspired. We are empowering anyone, including novice
content creators, communicators and creative professionals, to create, edit,
schedule and share content quickly and easily using Adobe Express, which
employs powerful capabilities from our flagship products like Photoshop,
Premiere and Acrobat to deliver the best of Adobe to customers at any level.
We are continuing to integrate collaboration capabilities into our
applications and workflows such as our native integration of Frame.io's review
and approval capabilities into Premiere Pro and After Effects. Similarly, our
new Share for Review feature in Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign provides
an efficient way for creators to seamlessly request, manage and view feedback
from stakeholders that makes exporting to other formats, emailing files,
tracking versions and keeping track feedback across different channels
obsolete. We are expanding the capabilities of Creative Cloud on the web with
improvements to our public beta web versions of Photoshop and Illustrator,
which allow subscribers to edit and review their files directly in their
browser. Other new features and solutions introduced in our products include
Substance 3D Modeler, a new desktop and VR application for creating 3D
objects; AI-powered quick actions and social media content scheduling in Adobe
Express; direct video upload from select cameras to Frame.io with Camera to
Cloud; and improved AI-powered neural filters and content-aware editing in
Photoshop and Lightroom. We are continuing to focus on democratizing 3D and
immersive content creation with Adobe Aero and our Substance suite of
products, as well as through integrating our Substance 3D capabilities into
our other applications.

We are pursuing new ways to inspire, empower and connect the creative
community, such as through our Create Change series, our creative residency
program and supporting live, interactive tutorials with creators on Behance.
We also offer a range of other creative tools and services, including
libraries of creative assets, such as Adobe Stock and Adobe Fonts; mobile-
first apps, such as Lightroom Mobile; and Creative Cloud Libraries, a central
place for users to store their assets. Further descriptions of our Digital
Media products are included below under "Principal Products and Services."

In our Creative Cloud business, we employ our product-led growth strategy to
minimize the friction of customer interactions and drive positive product
experiences, which results in increasing customer adoption, conversion,
expansion and loyalty. We also continue to employ a pricing strategy, as
appropriate, to migrate our customers to higher-value offerings as well as
attract past customers and potential users to try out our products and
ultimately subscribe. We use a data-driven operating model and our Adobe
Experience Cloud solutions to drive and optimize customer awareness,
engagement and licensing of our creative products and services at every stop
of the customer journey through our website and across other channels.
Adobe.com is the central destination where we engage individual and small
business customers to sign up for and renew Creative Cloud subscriptions. Our
customers have the flexibility to subscribe to over twenty of our Creative
Cloud products through a single subscription or, for many of our applications,
through various collections of our individual

5

Table of Contents

subscriptions to point products. To better serve our current users and
potential users, we offer free and premium levels for certain applications,
such as Adobe Express, and targeted packages and suites, such as our
Photography Plan and Substance 3D Collection. We use our data-driven operating
model and product-led growth strategy to optimize conversion of our users of
free apps and trials to paid subscribers. Our collaboration tools and services
help us to further expand our universe of customers beyond creative
professionals to other stakeholders who use our products for review and
approval, copywriting, social media marketing or other social content. We
utilize channel partners to target mid-size creative customers with our
Creative Cloud for teams offering. Our direct sales force is focused on
building relationships with our largest customers and driving adoption of our
Creative Cloud for enterprise offering. Overall, our strategy with Creative
Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with existing users,
attract new customers and grow a recurring and predictable revenue stream that
is recognized ratably.

In our Adobe Document Cloud business, we expect to drive sustained long-term
revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by
continuing to employ our product-led growth strategy, deliver the best PDF
experience on and across every platform, improve Acrobat web's functionality
and single-click ease of use, expand the number of task-based actions in
Acrobat and integrate Adobe Acrobat Sign into Acrobat across all surfaces. We
also intend to drive innovation with Adobe Sensei, our cross-platform AI and
machine learning technology, to make both new and legacy documents more
intelligent and responsive, unlock business workflows through PDF and Adobe
Acrobat Sign APIs, accelerate Document Cloud adoption through direct sales,
and leverage diversified go-to-market motions to reach all segments. With over
50 million searches for PDF-related actions per month, we intend to harness
that demand and attract new users to our Document Cloud services through
Acrobat web, which allows anyone to quickly access tools to create, edit,
convert, sign and compress PDFs through their web browser. As with our
Creative Cloud strategy, we utilize a data-driven operating model to market
our Document Cloud solutions and optimize our subscription-based pricing for
individuals as well as small and medium-sized businesses, large enterprises
and government institutions around the world. We aim to increase our reach in
our key markets through the utilization of our corporate and volume licensing
programs. We also intend to increase our focus on marketing and licensing
Acrobat in targeted vertical markets such as education, financial services,
telecommunications and government, as well as on expanding into emerging
markets. We will continue to engage in strategic partnerships to help drive
the enterprise business, including our partnerships with Microsoft, Workday,
ServiceNow and Notarize.

As our Document Cloud customers increasingly expect business processes to be
seamless across devices and the web, we are expanding our Document Cloud
capabilities to meet this need. Acrobat Reader is available on mobile devices,
with many of its standard features available on the go, and features "Liquid
Mode" to automatically reformat PDFs for quick navigation and easier
consumption on smaller screens. Acrobat is available on the web, delivering
quick results for common PDF actions with a single click. Adobe Scan powers
mobile devices with scanning capabilities, transforming paper documents into
full-featured PDFs. Adobe Acrobat Sign also provides a green alternative to
costly, paper-based solutions and offers a modern, convenient solution for
customers to digitally manage their documents, automate processes and contract
workflows. We believe that by using Adobe Sensei to enhance customer
experiences through machine learning and AI and continuing to add new
capabilities to our Acrobat, Adobe Scan and Adobe Acrobat Sign offerings, we
can help our customers continue to migrate away from paper-based processes and
adopt our solutions to modernize and digitize document experiences, growing
our revenue with this business in the process.

Digital Experience

Opportunity

Digital transformation is a macro trend that affects every business,
government and educational institution today--every business is a digital
business. Consumers today buy experiences, not just products, and they demand
personalized digital experiences that are relevant, engaging, seamless and
secure across an ever-expanding range of channels and devices. Business
customers increasingly have the same expectations, driving business-to-
business ("B2B") companies to deliver equally engaging and seamless
experiences as business-to-consumer ("B2C") companies and enterprise brands to
adopt "business-to-everyone" ("B2E") mindsets. Delivering the best,
personalized experience to a consumer at a given moment requires the right
combination of data, insights and content across multiple channels in real
time and at scale. In turn, executives, including those at the world's leading
brands, are increasingly seeking solutions that enable real-time
personalization at scale. Marketing and IT teams are looking for a return on
investment to demonstrate the business impact of their transformation
initiatives.

Adobe Experience Cloud is powering digital businesses by providing exceptional
experiences to their customers via a comprehensive suite of solutions. We
continue to believe that addressing the challenges of customer experience
management is a large and growing opportunity and we are in position to help
businesses and enterprises invest in solutions that aid their goals to
transform how they engage with their customers and constituents digitally.

Strategy

Our goal is to be a leading provider of cloud-based solutions for delivering
digital experiences and enabling digital transformation. The Adobe Experience
Cloud applications and services are designed to manage customer journeys,
enable personalized experiences at scale and deliver intelligence for
businesses of any size in any industry. The Adobe Experience Platform further
strengthens our differentiation by offering a way to connect our comprehensive
set of solutions.

Adobe Experience Cloud delivers solutions for our customers across the
following strategic growth pillars:

•Data insights and audiences. Our solutions, including Adobe Analytics, Adobe
Experience Platform, Customer Journey Analytics, Adobe Audience Manager and
our Real-time Customer Data Platform, deliver actionable data in real time to
provide highly tailored and adaptive experiences across platforms.

•Content and commerce. Our solutions help customers manage, deliver and
optimize content delivery through Adobe Experience Manager, and build multi-
channel commerce experiences for B2B and B2C customers on a single platform
with Adobe Commerce.

•Customer journeys. Our solutions help businesses manage, test, target,
personalize and deliver campaigns and customer journeys across B2B and B2C use
cases, including through Adobe Marketo Engage, Adobe Campaign, Adobe Target
and Journey Optimizer.

•Marketing workflows. Adobe Workfront is an enterprise work management
application that allows businesses to strategically plan, manage, collaborate
and execute on workflows for marketing campaigns and other projects at speed
and scale.

We also believe the AI and machine learning framework enabled by our strategy
with Adobe Sensei enhances the delivery of digital experiences. Adobe
Experience Cloud offers domain-specific AI services powered by Adobe Sensei
that work with Adobe Experience Platform to augment existing Experience Cloud
product offerings. These AI services help provide domain-specific intelligence
in areas such as attribution and automated insights, customer journey
management, lead management, sentiment analysis, one-click personalization,
enhanced anomaly detection and more. By building on existing features and
these AI-powered services, we believe Adobe Sensei will increase the value we
provide our customers and create a competitive differentiation in the market.

Adobe Experience Cloud also offers an open platform and ecosystem through the
Adobe Experience Platform, AI services, and developer services through Adobe
I/O. Adobe Experience Platform is the foundation of our Adobe Experience Cloud
products, with an open system that transforms user data from across Adobe
solutions and third-party software into robust customer profiles. Adobe
customer profiles are updated in real time and include AI-driven insights to
deliver the right customer experiences across channels. This open architecture
offers scalability with a wide variety of supporting products and services,
empowers users to quickly develop innovative applications to interact with
customers and enables a broad industry ecosystem.

To drive growth of Adobe Experience Cloud, we are focused on delivering the
best customer experience management solutions across B2B and B2C buyers, and
both enterprise and mid-market segments. We also intend to focus on
personalization at scale, customer engagement, growth within existing customer
accounts and product differentiation. We are continuing to add new services,
functionality and features to our current offerings. Some examples include a
new algorithm in Adobe Target that utilizes machine learning to provide
recommendations and tools that allow developers to optimize page load
performance and deliver personalized experiences more quickly. We are also
delivering new and improved integrations, such as increased synergy between
our Experience Cloud products and Creative Cloud and Adobe Acrobat Sign.
Within our established base of customers, we intend to pursue growth through a
scaled go-to-market approach focused on C-suite partnerships, transformational
accounts, continued customer acquisition, customer value realization and
solution expansion. We utilize a direct sales force to market and license our
Experience Cloud solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners,
including marketing agencies, SIs and ISVs that help license and deploy our
solutions to their customers. We also maintain several strategic partnerships
with other technology companies that allow us to increase our market reach. We
have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of
these routes to market and believe these investments will result in continued
growth in revenue in our Digital Experience segment in fiscal 2023 and beyond.

Publishing and Advertising

Our Publishing and Advertising segment contains legacy products and services
that address diverse market opportunities including eLearning solutions,
technical document publishing, web conferencing, document and forms platform,
web application development, high-end printing and our Adobe Advertising Cloud
offerings. Graphics professionals and professional publishers continue to
require quality, reliability and efficiency in production printing, and our
Adobe PostScript

COMPETITION

Overview

Adobe participates in a highly competitive environment globally, where our
competitors vary by industry segment and range from large multinational
enterprises to smaller entities with more narrowly focused product offerings.
Across our business, we recognize hundreds of competitors worldwide. The
markets for our products and services are characterized by new industry
standards, evolving distribution models, technology innovation, frequent
product introductions, short product life cycles, price cutting with resulting
downward pressure on gross margins and price sensitivity on the part of
consumers. Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance and better
integrate our existing products, introduce new products on a timely and cost-
effective basis, meet changing customer needs, provide best-in-class
information security to build customer confidence and combat cyber-attacks,
extend our core technology into new applications and anticipate emerging
standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological
changes.

A summary of the competitive environment for each of our business segments is
included below:

Digital Media

Our Digital Media segment faces competition from large, established companies
as well as a variety of point offerings, free products and downloadable apps.
We compete in a constantly evolving market and face significant direct or
indirect competition from software companies; device, hardware and camera
manufacturers; operating system developers that integrate digital imaging and
image management features with their operating systems; smartphone and tablet
manufacturers that integrate imaging and video software; proprietary and open
source web-authoring tools; mobile-first applications; web-native tools and
platforms; social media platforms that provide imaging and video offerings,
including editing capabilities; stock content marketplaces; and digital
document creation, storage, collaboration and signing providers.

We believe competitive factors in our markets include brand leadership,
product features and functionalities; integration with related tools and
third-party applications; the intuitiveness and visual appeal of user
interfaces; demonstrable cost-effective benefits to customers; pricing; the
flexibility of services to match changing business demands; usability and
accessibility on multiple devices, including mobile and desktop; and success
in educating customers in how to utilize services effectively. We believe our
greatest advantage in this space is the performance and scope of our
integrated solutions, which work together as part of Creative Cloud or
Document Cloud. We are a leader through our ability to offer a very broad and
comprehensive array of products and services through our Adobe Creative Cloud.
With Creative Cloud, we believe we compete well with our features and
functionality, ease of use, product reliability, value and performance
characteristics. With Adobe Express, we believe we compete well by making our
professional creative technology accessible to a wider audience of first-time
creators, communicators and creative professionals and enabling easy-to-use,
efficient content creation for quick projects. With Document Cloud, we believe
we compete well based on the global use of PDF, our features and
functionalities, which are critical tools for millions of business
communicators, and our brand leadership.

Digital Experience

Our Digital Experience business unit competes in markets that are growing
rapidly and characterized by intense competition. Our Adobe Experience Cloud
solutions face competition from large, established companies, including large
enterprise software, internet and database management companies, in addition
to point product solutions and focused competitors, and new competitors are
constantly entering these markets. Some of these competitors provide SaaS
solutions to customers, generally through a web browser, while others provide
software that is installed by customers directly on their servers. In
addition, we compete at times with our customers' or potential customers'
internally-developed applications.

We believe competitive factors in our markets include the proven performance,
security, scalability, flexibility and reliability of services; the strategic
relationships and integration with third-party applications; the intuitiveness
and visual appeal

of user interfaces; demonstrable cost-effective benefits to customers;
pricing; the flexibility of services to match changing business demands;
enterprise-level customer service and training; brand leadership; the
usability of services; real-time data and reporting; independence from portals
and search engines; the ability to deploy the services globally; and success
in educating customers in how to utilize services effectively. We believe we
compete well with both enterprise and low-cost alternatives based on many of
these competitive factors including our strong feature set, the breadth of our
offerings, our focus on global, multi-brand companies, our superior user
experience, tools for building multi-screen, cross-channel applications,
standards-based architecture, scalability and performance and leadership in
industry standards efforts.

Publishing and Advertising

Our Publishing and Advertising product offerings face competition from large-
scale publishing systems and XML-based publishing companies, as well as lower-
end desktop publishing products. Our web conferencing product faces
competition from a number of established products from other large software
companies. Competition involves a number of factors, including product
features, ease-of-use, the level of customization and integration supported,
the number of hardware platforms supported, service and price. We believe we
can successfully compete based upon the quality and features of our products,
integrations with our Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Digital Experience
products and our strong brand among users.

Investments

From time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies. We
enter into these investments with the intent of securing financial returns as
well as for strategic purposes, as they often increase our knowledge of
emerging markets and technologies and expand our opportunities to provide
Adobe products and services.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

A continuous high level of investment is required for the enhancement of
existing solutions and the development of new solutions due to the speed of
technological change that characterizes the software industry. We develop our
software internally, as well as acquire products or technology developed by
others by purchasing the stock or assets of the business entity that owns the
technology. In other instances, we have licensed or purchased the intellectual
property ownership rights of programs

15

* * *

Table of Contents

developed by others with license or technology transfer agreements that may
obligate us to pay a flat license fee or royalties, typically based on a
dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the revenue generated by those
programs.

PROTECTING AND LICENSING OUR PRODUCTS

We protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents,
copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, foreign intellectual property laws,
confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. We have U.S. and
international patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects
of our products and technology. Although our patents have value, no single
patent is essential to any of our principal businesses. We have also
registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international
trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights.

We license our desktop software and mobile apps to users under 'click through'
or signed license agreements containing restrictions on duplication,
disclosure and transfer. Similarly, cloud products and services are provided
to users under 'click through' or signed agreements containing restrictions on
access and use. Our enterprise customers license our hosted offerings as SaaS
or Managed Services.

Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual
property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use
our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our
applications. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual
property rights is difficult. We believe that our transition from perpetual-
use software licenses to a subscription-based business model combined with the
increased focus on cloud-based computing has and may continue to improve our
efforts to combat the pirating of our products.

HUMAN CAPITAL

Our culture is built on the foundation that our people and the way we treat
one another promote creativity, innovation and performance, which spur the
Company's success. We are continually investing in our global workforce to
further drive diversity and inclusion, provide fair and market-competitive pay
and benefits to support our employees' wellbeing, and foster their growth and
development. As of December 2, 2022, we employed 29,239 people, of which 51%
were in the United States and 49% were in our international locations. During
fiscal 2022, our total attrition rate was 11.7%. We have not experienced work
stoppages and believe our employee relations are good. Our employee listening
program helps us understand employee sentiment on a wide range of topics
throughout the employee lifecycle, providing insights that inform our
decisions about employee programs, talent risks, management opportunities,
employee networks and more. In fiscal 2022, 79% of our employees participated
in our most recent engagement survey.

Diversity and Inclusion

Adobe For All is our vision to advance diversity, equity and inclusion across
the Company. We recognize that everyone deserves respect and equal treatment,
regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, age, disability, sexual orientation,
gender identity, cultural background or religious belief. As of December 2,
2022, women represented 34.6% of our global employees, and underrepresented
minorities ("URMs," defined as those who identify as Black/African American,
Hispanic/Latinx, Native American, Pacific Islander and/or two or more races)
represented 11.7% of our U.S. employees. To continue to improve employee
representation, we have declared a set of aspirational goals for women in
leadership positions globally, underrepresented minorities in leadership
positions in the United States and overall Black representation.

We have a three-pillar strategy to grow the diversity of our workforce over
time, on which we have continued to drive progress during fiscal 2022:

•Workforce: We take actions to improve the hiring, retention and promotion of
a more diverse workforce to achieve our aspirational goals. In fiscal 2022, we
sourced candidates from a variety of conferences and partnerships, such as
AfroTech, AdColor, BreakLine, HBCU 20x20 and Management Leadership for
Tomorrow. We have continued to develop and invest in our partnerships with
historically black colleges and universities and Hispanic-serving
institutions. We are investing in the success of underrepresented candidates
and employees through mentoring, leadership, employee and internship programs
and career coaching.

•Workplace: We are building an inclusive environment that inspires a sense of
belonging and encourages people to be their authentic selves. We continue to
support our employee resource groups to create community for employees from
underrepresented groups. Our Taking Action initiative is focused on
accelerating the representation, development and success of Adobe's Black
employees and other underrepresented groups. We host annual learning events,
including our Juneteenth Global Day of Learning and our Adobe for All Week
events.

•Ecosystem: We strive to bring progress on diversity to our brand, products,
partnerships, community engagement and the vendors we use. We collaborate with
industry peers to advance diversity across multiple dimensions, including
through our participation in the CEO Action on Diversity & Inclusion, The
Valuable 500, the Ascend 5-Point Action Agenda and ParityPledge. In fiscal
2022, we launched the Adobe Equity and Advancement Initiative, a multi-faceted
grantmaking program to support non-profit organizations, and we continued to
invest in our Supplier Diversity program to purchase goods and services from
businesses that are certified as majority-owned and operated by
underrepresented groups.

We invest in analysis and transparency to demonstrate our commitment to fair
compensation. We define pay parity as ensuring that employees in the same job
and location are paid fairly regardless of their gender or ethnicity. In
fiscal 2022, we again achieved global gender pay parity and U.S. URM and non-
URM pay parity. We continue to monitor our progress to ensure that we are
creating a culture that fairly rewards and recognizes the contributions of all
employees.

Additional information on our diversity and inclusion strategy, diversity
metrics and programs can be found on our website at adobe.com/diversity.

Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Compensation, Benefits and Wellbeing

We offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits that support our
employees' overall wellbeing. To ensure alignment with our short- and long-
term objectives, our compensation programs for all employees include base pay,
short-term incentives and opportunities for long-term incentives. We believe
this alignment, whether through equity awards issued by Adobe or employee
participation in our employee stock purchase plan, provides employee
shareholders with meaningfully deeper connections to Adobe and contributes to
the Company's long-term success. Our wellbeing and benefit programs focus on
four key pillars: physical, emotional, financial and community. We offer a
wide array of benefits including comprehensive health and welfare insurance,
generous time-off and leave and retirement and financial support. We provide
emotional wellbeing services through our Employee Assistance Program and a
variety of interactive apps. Our wellness reimbursement of up to $600 per year
for each eligible employee, lifestyle coaching, global wellbeing speaker
series and ergonomic programs help to support employees' physical and
emotional wellbeing. In addition, our financial education and financial
wellness coaches offer employees tools and resources to reach their personal
financial goals. To build community, we bring together our employees through
onsite events, messaging forums and our Employee Networks to share stories and
engage with one another.

In response to supporting employees after the COVID-19 pandemic, we
implemented changes that we determined were in the best interest of our
employees and the communities in which we operate. This includes a hybrid work
schedule for our employees and implementing resources and tools for them to be
successful, including the global expansion of dependent care programs to help
employees balance their work and life responsibilities. We provide up to 20
working days per calendar year of paid time off for employees who cannot work
due to circumstances related to pandemic or natural disaster and company-wide
global wellbeing days for employees to take a break from work and take care of
themselves. Additionally, we introduced "Let's Talk" and healing sessions to
support employees facing challenging circumstances.

Future of Work

Digital transformation and the COVID-19 pandemic have fundamentally changed
how people work, and we are leaning into digital-first workflows, tools and
resources to enable us to be productive, wherever we are. We also believe in
the value of people being together--fostering trust, relationships and
collaboration and innovation. Over the past year, we have been evolving to a
hybrid model, in which employees who are assigned to an office can divide
their work between the office and home about half the time. We are actively
piloting, testing and iterating our approach to support new ways of working
and evolving the employee experience.

Growth and Development

At Adobe, employees are given the opportunity to drive their own careers. The
Global Talent Development team creates programs to support leaders, managers
and employees in their career growth and personal development. In addition to
the content created in house, employees also have access to on-demand content
via several industry-leading learning platforms. Through Adobe's Learning
Fund, employees are eligible to receive up to $11,000 per year toward
university and short-term learning opportunities.

Adobe is committed to enabling a culture that celebrates talent sharing,
career development and agility across the Company. We post all roles
internally first before sharing them externally and have made several
technology enhancements to make the internal job search easier for employees.
We also provide forums for managers and employees to have regular
conversations about their career and contributions throughout the year.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

As previously discussed, our actual results could differ materially from our
forward-looking statements. Below we discuss some of the factors that could
cause these differences. These and many other factors described in this report
could adversely affect our operations, performance and financial condition.

Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business

The markets in which we participate are intensely competitive, and if we
cannot continue to develop, acquire, market and offer new products and
services or enhancements to existing products and services that meet customer
requirements, our operating results could suffer.

The markets for our products and services are characterized by intense
competition, new industry standards, evolving distribution models, limited
barriers to entry, new technology developments, short product life cycles,
customer price sensitivity, global market conditions and frequent product
introductions (including alternatives with limited functionality available at
lower costs or free of charge). Any of these factors could create downward
pressure on pricing and gross margins and could adversely affect our renewal
and upsell and cross-sell rates, as well as our ability to attract new
customers.

Our future success will depend on our continued ability to enhance and
integrate our existing products and services, introduce new products and
services in a timely and cost-effective manner, meet changing customer
expectations and needs, extend our core technology into new applications, and
anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and
other technological developments. For example, consumers continue to migrate
from personal computers to tablet and mobile devices and from desktop to the
web. While we offer our products on a variety of platforms, if we cannot
continue adapting our products to tablet and mobile devices or the web, or if
our competitors can adapt their products more quickly than us, our business
could be harmed. In addition, releases of new devices or operating systems may
make it more difficult for our products to perform or may require significant
cost to adapt our solutions. The potential costs and delays incurred as a
result could harm our business. If we fail to anticipate or misjudge
customers' rapidly changing needs and expectations or adapt to emerging
technological trends, our market share and results of operations could suffer.

Furthermore, some of our competitors and potential competitors enjoy
competitive advantages, such as greater financial, technical, sales, marketing
and other resources, broader brand awareness and access to larger customer
bases. As a result of these advantages, potential and current customers might
select the products and services of our competitors, causing a loss of our
market share. Our competitors, including large enterprises, may develop
products, features or services that are similar to ours or that achieve
greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product
development efforts or marketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive
pricing policies.

For additional information regarding our competition and the risks arising out
of the competitive environment in which we operate, see the section titled
"Competition" contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report.

Introduction of new technology could harm our business and results of
operations.

The expectations and needs of technology consumers are constantly evolving. As
new technology is developed, integration of our products and services with one
another and other companies' offerings creates an increasingly complex
ecosystem that is also partly reliant on third parties. If any disruptive
technology, or competing products, services or operating systems that are not
compatible with our solutions, achieve widespread acceptance, our operating
results could suffer and our business could be harmed.

Table of Contents

The introduction of, or limitations on, certain technologies may reduce the
effectiveness of our products and our business operations. For example, some
of our products and services, including those marketed or licensed through
adobe.com, rely on tracking, third-party cookies or other identifiers to help
our customers more effectively advertise and detect and prevent fraudulent
activity. However, consumers can, with increasing ease, implement technologies
to limit the ability to collect and use data to deliver or advertise services.
Increased use of methods to control the use of these technologies through
customers' browsers, operating systems, device settings or "ad-blocking"
software or applications may harm our business.

We may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future investments or
acquisitions, and integration of acquisitions may disrupt our business and
management.

We may not realize the anticipated benefits of an investment or acquisition of
a company, division, product or technology, each of which involves numerous
risks. These risks include:

•inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and
combined businesses;

•difficulty in, and the cost of, effectively integrating the operations,
technologies, products or services, and personnel of the acquired business;

•potential identified or unknown security vulnerabilities in acquired products
that expose us to additional security risks or delay our ability to integrate
the product into our offerings;

•entry into markets in which we have minimal prior experience and where
competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;

•disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and
other employees from other opportunities and challenges;

•inability to retain personnel of the acquired business;

•inability to retain key customers, distributors, vendors and other business
partners of the acquired business;

•inability to take advantage of anticipated tax benefits;

•incurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired
intangible assets that could impact our operating results;

•elevated delinquency or bad debt write-offs related to receivables of the
acquired business we assume;

•additional costs of bringing acquired companies into compliance with laws and
regulations applicable to a multinational corporation;

•difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the
transition and integration;

•impairment of our relationships with employees, customers, partners,
distributors or third-party providers of our technologies, products or
services;

•failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant problems,
liabilities or other challenges of an acquired company or technology;

•exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of
claims or litigation risk as a result of, an acquisition, such as claims from
terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties;

•incurring significant exit charges if products or services acquired in
business combinations are unsuccessful;

•inability to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are
effective;

•inability to obtain, or obtain in a timely manner, approvals from
governmental authorities, which could delay prevent or impose conditions on
such acquisitions;

•the failure of strategic investments to perform as expected or to meet
financial projections;

•delay in customer and distributor purchasing decisions due to uncertainty
about the direction of our product and service offerings;

21

Table of Contents

•additional stock-based compensation issued or assumed in connection with an
acquisition, including the impact on stockholder dilution and our results of
operations;

•increased accounts receivables collection times and working capital
requirements associated with acquired business models; and

•incompatibility of business cultures.

Mergers and acquisitions of technology companies are inherently risky. If we
do not complete an announced acquisition transaction, including the pending
acquisition of Figma, Inc., or integrate an acquired business successfully and
in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition to the
extent anticipated, and in certain circumstances an acquisition could harm our
financial position.

Our ability to acquire other businesses or technologies, make strategic
investments or integrate acquired businesses effectively may also be impaired
by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including government actions in light
of the pandemic, trade tensions, restrictions and increased global scrutiny of
foreign investments. For example, a number of countries, including the United
States and countries in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, are considering or
have adopted restrictions on foreign investments. Governments may continue to
adopt or tighten restrictions of this nature, and such restrictions could
negatively impact our business and financial results.

The success of some of our product and service offerings depends on our
ability to continue to attract and retain customers of and contributors to our
online marketplaces for creative content.

The success of some of our product and service offerings, such as Adobe Stock,
depends on our ability to continue to retain existing and attract new
customers and contributors to these online marketplaces for creative content.
An increase in paying customers has generally resulted in more content from
contributors, which increases the size of our collection and in turn attracts
new paying customers. We rely on the functionality and features of our online
marketplaces, the size and content of our collection and the effectiveness of
our marketing efforts to attract new customers and contributors and retain
existing ones. New technologies may render the features of our online
marketplaces obsolete, our collection may fail to grow as anticipated or our
marketing efforts may be unsuccessful, any of which may adversely affect our
results of operations.

If our products or platforms are used to create or disseminate objectionable
content, particularly misleading content intended to manipulate public
opinion, our brand reputation may be damaged, and our business and financial
results may be harmed.

We believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of
our business. Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Adobe increases our
ability to enter new categories, launch new and innovative products to better
serve our customers and expand our customer base. Our brands may be negatively
affected by the use of our products or services to create or disseminate
newsworthy content that is deemed to be misleading, deceptive or intended to
manipulate public opinion (e.g., "DeepFakes"), by the use of our products or
services for illicit, objectionable or illegal ends, or by our failure to
respond appropriately and expeditiously to such uses of our products and
services. Such uses of our products and services may also cause us to face
claims related to defamation, rights of publicity and privacy, illegal
content, misinformation and personal injury torts. Maintaining and enhancing
our brands may require us to make substantial investments and these
investments may not be successful. If we fail to appropriately respond to
objectionable content created using our products or services or shared on our
platforms, our users may lose confidence in our brands and our business and
financial results may be adversely affected. In addition, government
regulation designed to address DeepFakes could adversely impact our product
offerings.

Social and ethical issues relating to the use of new and evolving
technologies, such as AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm and
liability.

Social and ethical issues relating to the use of new and evolving technologies
such as artificial intelligence ("AI") in our offerings, may result in
reputational harm and liability, and may cause us to incur additional research
and development costs to resolve such issues. We are increasingly building AI
into many of our offerings. As with many innovations, AI presents risks and
challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. If we
enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or
actual impact on society, we may experience brand or reputational harm,
competitive harm or legal liability. Potential government regulation related
to AI use and ethics may also increase the burden and cost of research and
development in this area, and failure to properly remediate AI usage or ethics
issues may cause public confidence in AI to be undermined, which could slow
adoption of AI in our products and services. The rapid evolution of AI will
require the application of resources to develop, test and maintain our
products and services to help ensure that AI is implemented ethically in order
to minimize unintended, harmful impact. Uncertainty around new and emerging AI
applications such as generative AI content creation may require additional
investment in the development of proprietary datasets and machine learning
models,

22

development of new approaches and processes to provide attribution or
remuneration to content creators and building systems that enable creatives to
have greater control over the use of their work in the development of AI,
which may be costly and could impact our profit margin if we decide to expand
generative AI into all our product offerings. Developing, testing, and
deploying AI systems may also increase the cost profile of our offerings due
to the nature of the computing costs involved in such systems.

Risks Related to the Operation of Our Business

Security breaches in data centers we manage, or third parties manage on our
behalf, may compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of
employee and customer data, which could expose us to liability and adversely
affect our reputation and business.

We process and store significant amounts of employee and customer data, a
large volume of which is hosted by third-party service providers. A security
incident impacting our own data centers or those controlled by our service
providers may compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of
this data. Unauthorized access to or loss or disclosure of data stored by
Adobe or our service providers may occur through physical break-ins, breaches
of a secure network by an unauthorized party, software vulnerabilities or
coding errors, employee mistakes, theft or misuse or other misconduct. It is
also possible that unauthorized access to or disclosure of employee or
customer data may occur through inadequate use of security controls by
customers, service providers or employees. The compromise of personal,
confidential or proprietary information could cause a loss of data, disrupt
our operations, damage our reputation, give rise to remediation or other
expenses and subject us to claims or other liabilities, regulatory
investigations or fines. Adobe maintains insurance to cover operational risks,
such as cyber risk and technology outages, but this insurance may not cover
all costs associated with the consequences of personal, confidential or
proprietary information being compromised. Further, such perceived or actual
unauthorized loss or disclosure of the information we collect, process or
store, or breach of our security could damage our reputation, result in the
loss of customers and harm our business.

We rely on data centers managed both by Adobe and third parties to host and
deliver our services, as well as access, collect, process, use, transmit and
store data, and any interruptions or delays in these hosted services, or
failures in data collection or transmission could expose us to liability and
harm our business and reputation.

Much of our business relies on hardware and services that are hosted, managed
and controlled directly by Adobe or third-party service providers, including
our online store at adobe.com and our Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and
Experience Cloud solutions. We do not have redundancy for all of our systems,
many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers, and
our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. If our
business relationship with a third-party provider of hosting or content
delivery services is negatively affected, or if one of our content delivery
suppliers were to terminate its agreement with us without adequate notice, we
might not be able to deliver the corresponding hosted offerings to our
customers, which could disrupt our business operations and those of our
customers, subject us to reputational harm, costly and time-intensive
notification requirements, and cause us to lose customers and future business.
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt the supply
chain of hardware needed to maintain these third-party systems and services or
to run our business. In addition, supply chain disruptions stemming from the
Russia-Ukraine war may harm our customers and suppliers and further complicate
existing supply chain constraints. Occasionally, we migrate data among data
centers and to third-party hosted environments. If a transition among data
centers or to third-party service providers encounters unexpected
interruptions, unforeseen complexity or unplanned disruptions despite
precautions undertaken during the process, this may impair our delivery of
products and services to customers and result in increased costs and
liabilities, which may harm our operating results, reputation and our
business.

It is also possible that hardware or software failures or errors in our
systems (or those of our third-party service providers) could result in data
loss or corruption, cause the information that we collect or maintain to be
incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers regard as significant,
or cause us to fail to meet committed service levels or comply with applicable
notification requirements. Furthermore, our ability to collect and report data
may be delayed or interrupted by a number of factors, including access to the
internet, the failure of our network or software systems, security breaches or
significant variability in visitor traffic on customer websites. In addition,
the loss of data resulting from computer viruses, worms, ransomware or other
malware may harm our systems could expose us to litigation or regulatory
investigation, and costly and time-intensive notification requirements.

We may also find, on occasion, that we cannot deliver data and reports to our
customers in near real time due to factors such as significant spikes in
customer activity on their websites or failures of our network or software (or
that of a third-party service provider). If we fail to plan infrastructure
capacity appropriately and expand it proportionally with the needs of our
customer base, and we experience a rapid and significant demand on the
capacity of our data centers or those of third parties, service outages or
performance issues could occur, which would impact our customers. Such a
strain on our infrastructure

23

capacity could subject us to regulatory and customer notification
requirements, violations of service level agreement commitments or financial
liabilities and result in customer dissatisfaction or harm our business. If we
supply materially inaccurate information or experience significant
interruptions in our systems, our reputation could be harmed, we could lose
customers and we could be found liable for damages or incur other losses.

Security vulnerabilities in our products and systems, or in our supply chain,
could lead to reduced revenue or to liability claims.

Maintaining the security of our products and services is a critical issue for
us and our customers. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming
increasingly sophisticated and complex, making it increasingly difficult to
detect and successfully defend against them. Certain unauthorized parties have
in the past managed, and may again in the future manage, to gain access to and
misuse some of our systems and software, or that of our third-party service
providers, in order to access the authentication, payment and personal
information of our end users and employees. In addition, cyber-attackers
(which may include individuals or groups, as well as sophisticated groups with
significant resources, such as nation-state and state-sponsored attackers)
also develop and deploy viruses, worms, credential stuffing attack tools and
other malicious software programs, some of which may be specifically designed
to attack our products, services, information systems or networks. The
frequency and sophistication of such threats continues to increase and often
becomes further heightened in connection with geopolitical tensions. Hardware,
software and operating system applications that we develop or procure from
third parties have contained and may contain defects in design or manufacture,
including bugs, vulnerabilities and other problems that could unexpectedly
compromise the security of the system or impair a customer's ability to
operate or use our products. Like other global companies, we face an
increasingly difficult challenge to attract and retain highly qualified
security personnel to assist us in combating these security threats. The costs
to prevent, eliminate, mitigate or alleviate cyber or other security problems,
bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities
are significant, and our efforts to address these problems, including
notifying affected parties, may not be successful or may be delayed and could
result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or
potential customers. It is impossible to predict the extent, frequency or
impact these problems may have on us.

Outside parties have in the past and may in the future attempt to fraudulently
induce our employees or users of our products or services to disclose
sensitive, personal or confidential information via illegal electronic
spamming, phishing or other tactics. This existing risk is compounded given
the current hybrid model work environment, where a large portion of our
workforce spends a portion of their time working in our offices and a portion
of their time working from home. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain
physical access to our facilities in order to infiltrate our information
systems or attempt to gain logical access to our products, services or
information systems for the purpose of exfiltrating content and data. These
actual and potential breaches of our security measures and the accidental
loss, inadvertent disclosure or unauthorized dissemination of proprietary
information or sensitive, personal or confidential data about us, our
employees, our customers or their end users, including the potential loss or
disclosure of such information or data could expose us, our employees, our
customers or other individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this
information. This may result in litigation and liability or fines, costly and
time-intensive notice requirements, governmental inquiry or oversight or a
loss of customer confidence, any of which could harm our business or damage
our brand and reputation, thereby requiring time and resources to mitigate
these impacts. These risks will likely increase as we expand our hosted
offerings, integrate our products and services and store and process more
data.

These issues affect our products and services in particular because cyber-
attackers tend to focus their efforts on popular offerings with a large user
base, and we expect them to continue to do so. From time to time we have
identified, and in the future we may identify other, vulnerabilities in some
of our applications and services and those of our third-party service
providers. In some cases, such vulnerabilities may not be immediately
detected, which may make it difficult to recover critical services and lead to
damaged assets. We continuously monitor and develop our information technology
networks and infrastructure in an effort to prevent, detect, address and
mitigate the risk of threats to our data, systems and networks, including
malware and computer virus attacks, ransomware, unauthorized access, business
email compromise, misuse, denial-of-service attacks, system failures and
disruptions. These continued enhancements and changes, as well as changes
designed to update and enhance our protective measures to address new threats,
may increase the risk of a system or process failure or the creation of a gap
in the associated security measures. Any such failure or gap could materially
and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial
results. We devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities
through engineering more secure products, enhancing security and reliability
features in our products and systems, code hardening, conducting rigorous
penetration tests, deploying updates to address security vulnerabilities,
regularly reviewing our service providers' security controls, reviewing and
auditing our hosted services against independent security control frameworks
(such as ISO 27001, SOC 2 and PCI), providing resources, such as mandatory
security training, for our workforce and improving our incident response time,
but security vulnerabilities cannot be totally eliminated. The cost of
undertaking these efforts could reduce our operating margins, and we may be
unable to implement these measures quickly enough to prevent unauthorized
access into our systems and products in all circumstances. Despite our
preventative efforts, there is no assurance that our security measures will
provide

24

* * *

Table of Contents

full effective protection from such events, and actual or perceived security
vulnerabilities in our products and systems may harm our reputation or lead to
claims against us (and have in the past led to such claims) and could lead
some customers to stop using certain products or services or to reduce or
delay future purchases. If we do not make the appropriate level of investment
in our technology systems and we are not able to deliver the quality of data
security and privacy our customers require or that meet our independent
security control certification requirements, our business could be adversely
affected. Customers may also adopt security measures designed to protect their
existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of new
technologies. Moreover, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers
resulting from disruptions caused by cyber-attacks, overly burdensome
preventative security measures or failure to fully meet independent security
control certification requirements could adversely affect our financial
results, stock price and reputation.

Some of our enterprise offerings have extended and complex sales cycles, which
can make our sales cycles unpredictable.

Sales cycles for some of our enterprise offerings, including our Adobe
Experience Cloud and Adobe Experience Platform solutions and Enterprise Term
License Agreements ("ETLAs") in our Digital Media business, are multi-phased
and complex, which also makes it difficult to predict when a given sales cycle
will close. The complexity in these sales cycles is due to several factors,
including:

•the need for our sales representatives to educate customers about the use and
benefit of large-scale deployments of our products and services;

•the desire of organizations to undertake significant evaluation processes to
determine their technology requirements prior to making information technology
expenditures and the need for our representatives to spend a significant
amount of time assisting with such evaluations;

•intensifying competition within the industry;

•the negotiation of large, complex, enterprise-wide contracts;

•the need for our customers to obtain requisition approvals from various
decision makers within their organizations due to the complexity of our
solutions touching multiple departments; and

•customer budget constraints, economic conditions and unplanned administrative
delays.

We spend substantial time and expense on our sales efforts without assurance
that potential customers will ultimately purchase our solutions. As we target
our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, these trends are expected to
continue and could have a greater impact on our results of operations.
Additionally, our enterprise sales pattern has historically been uneven, where
a higher percentage of a quarter's total sales occur during the final weeks of
each quarter, which is common in our industry.

Our business could be harmed if we fail to effectively manage critical
strategic third-party business relationships.

As our offerings expand and our customer base grows, our relationships with
strategic partners become increasingly valuable. If our contractual
relationships with these third parties were to terminate, or if we were unable
to renew on favorable terms, our business could be harmed. This is especially
the case when the third party's offerings are integrated with our products and
services, or where the third party's offerings are difficult to substitute or
replace. Alternative arrangements for such products and services may not be
available to us on commercially reasonable terms, and we may experience
business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner. The
failure of third parties to provide acceptable products and services or to
update their technology may result in a disruption to our business operations
and those of our customers, which may reduce our revenues and profits, cause
us to lose customers and damage our reputation.

We increasingly utilize third-party distribution platforms, such as Apple's
App Store and Google's Play Store, for the distribution of certain of our
product offerings. Although we benefit from the strong brand recognition and
large user base of these distribution platforms to attract new customers, the
platform owners have wide discretion to change the pricing structure, terms of
service and other policies with respect to us and other developers, and may
offer or promote products that compete with our product offerings. Adverse
changes by these third parties could adversely affect our financial results.

Failure of our third-party customer service and technical support providers to
adequately address customers' requests could harm our business and adversely
affect our financial results.

Our customers rely on our customer service support organization to resolve
issues with our products and services. We depend heavily, and expect to
continue to rely heavily, on third-party customer service and technical
support representatives to provide such services. This strategy presents risks
to our business since we may not be able to influence the quality of support

25

* * *

Table of Contents

as directly as if our own employees performed these activities. Our customers
may react negatively to providing information to, and receiving support from,
third-party organizations, especially if these third-party organizations are
based overseas. If we encounter problems with our third-party customer service
and technical support providers, our reputation may be harmed, our ability to
sell our offerings could be adversely affected, and we could lose customers
and associated revenue.

If we are unable to recruit and retain key personnel, our business may be
harmed, and our attempts to operate under a hybrid work model may not be
successful and adversely impact our business.

Much of our future success depends on the continued service, availability and
performance of our senior management and highly-skilled personnel across all
levels of our organization. Our senior management has acquired specialized
knowledge and skills with respect to our business, and the loss of any of
these individuals could harm our business, especially if we are not successful
in developing adequate succession plans. Our efforts to attract, develop,
integrate and retain highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications
may be compounded by intensified restrictions on travel, immigration or the
availability of work visas. Competition for experienced personnel in the
information technology industry is intense and has recently intensified
further due to industry trends in many areas where our employees are located.
Further, the increased availability of hybrid or remote working arrangements
has expanded the pool of companies that can compete for our employees and
employment candidates. We may experience higher compensation costs to retain
senior management and experienced personnel that may not be offset by improved
productivity or increased sales. A hybrid work environment may also present
operational, cybersecurity and workplace culture challenges. If we are unable
to continue to successfully attract and retain highly skilled personnel and
maintain our corporate culture in a hybrid work environment, our business may
be harmed.

We continue to hire personnel in countries where exceptional technical
knowledge and other expertise are offered at lower costs, which increases the
efficiency of our global workforce structure and reduces our personnel related
expenditures. Nonetheless, as globalization continues, competition for
employees in these countries has increased, which may impact our ability to
retain these employees and increase our compensation-related expenses. We may
continue to expand our international operations and international sales and
marketing activities, which would require significant management attention and
resources. We may be unable to scale our infrastructure effectively or as
quickly as our competitors in these markets, and our revenue may not increase
sufficiently to offset these expected increases in costs, causing our results
to suffer.

We believe that a critical contributor to our success to date has been our
corporate culture, which we have built to foster innovation, teamwork and
employee satisfaction. As we grow, including from the integration of employees
and businesses acquired in connection with previous or future acquisitions, we
may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture,
which could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel who
are essential to our future success.

Failure to manage our sales, partner and distribution channels effectively
could result in a loss of revenue and harm our business.

We contract with a number of software distributors and other strategic
partners, none of which are individually responsible for a material amount of
our total net revenue in any recent period. Nonetheless, if an agreement with
one of our distributors were terminated, any prolonged delay in securing a
replacement distributor could have a negative impact on our results of
operations.

Successfully managing our indirect distribution channel efforts to reach
various customer segments for our products and services is a complex process
across the broad range of geographies where we do business or plan to do
business. Our distributors and other channel partners are independent
businesses that we do not control. Notwithstanding the independence of our
channel partners, we face legal risk and potential reputational harm from the
activities of these third parties including, but not limited to, export
control violations, workplace conditions, corruption and anti-competitive
behavior.

We cannot be certain that our distribution channel will continue to market or
sell our products and services effectively. If our partner and distribution
channels are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and
revenue. If our distributors favor our competitors' products or services for
any reason, they may fail to market our products or services effectively,
which would cause our results to suffer. If our OEMs through which we
distribute products and services decide not to bundle our applications on
their devices, our results could suffer. Further, the financial health of our
distributors and partners and our continuing relationships with them are
important to our success. Some of these distributors and partners may be
unable to withstand adverse changes in economic conditions, which could result
in insolvency, the inability of such distributors and partners to obtain
credit to finance access to or purchases of our products and services, or a
delay in paying their obligations to us.

We also sell some of our products and services through our direct sales force.
Risks associated with this sales channel include more extended sales and
collection cycles, challenges related to hiring, retaining and motivating our
direct sales force,

26

* * *

Table of Contents

and substantial amounts of ongoing training for sales representatives.
Moreover, recent hires may not be as productive as we would like, as in most
cases it takes significant time for them to achieve full productivity. Our
business could be seriously harmed if our expansion efforts of our direct
sales do not generate a corresponding significant increase in revenue and we
are unable to achieve the efficiencies we anticipate. In addition, the loss of
key sales employees could impact our customer relationships and future ability
to sell to certain accounts covered by such employees.

We face various risks associated with our operating as a multinational
corporation.

As a global business that generates approximately 42% of our total revenue
from sales to customers outside of the Americas, we are subject to a number of
risks, including:

•inflation and actions taken by central banks to counter inflation;

•foreign currency fluctuations and controls;

•international and regional economic, political and labor conditions,
including any instability or security concerns abroad, such as uncertainty
caused by economic sanctions, trade disputes, armed conflicts and wars;

•tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries);

•increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;

•changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements;

•changes in laws governing the free flow of data across international borders;

•failure of laws to protect our intellectual property rights adequately;

•inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing
international operations;

•delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain
technology, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers;

•the imposition of governmental economic sanctions on countries in which we do
business or where we plan to expand our business;

•costs and delays associated with developing products in multiple languages;

•operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent
business practices; and

•other factors beyond our control, such as terrorism, war, natural disasters,
climate change and pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting
restrictions on business activity, which may vary significantly by region.

Some of our third-party business partners have international operations and
are also subject to these risks, and our business may be harmed if such
partners are unable to appropriately manage these risks. If sales to any of
our customers outside of the Americas are reduced, delayed or canceled because
of any of the above factors, our revenue may decline.

Risks Related to Laws and Regulations

We are subject to risks associated with compliance with laws and regulations
globally, which may harm our business.

We are a global company subject to varied and complex laws, regulations and
customs, both domestically and internationally. These laws and regulations
relate to a number of aspects of our business, including trade protection,
import and export control, anti-boycott, sanctions and embargoes, data and
transaction processing security, payment card industry data security
standards, records management, user-generated content hosted on websites we
operate, privacy practices, data residency, corporate governance, anti-trust
and competition, employee and third-party complaints, anti-corruption, gift
policies, conflicts of interest, securities regulations and other regulatory
requirements affecting trade and investment. The application of these laws and
regulations to our business is often unclear and may at times conflict. For
example, in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing
economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by
U.S. regulations applicable to us, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act. We cannot provide assurance that our employees, contractors, agents and
business partners will not take actions in violation of our internal policies
or U.S. laws. Compliance with these laws and regulations may involve
significant costs or require changes in our business practices that result in
reduced revenue and profitability. Non-compliance could also result in fines,
damages, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees,
prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation.

27

Table of Contents

In addition, approximately 49% of our employees are located outside the United
States. Accordingly, we are exposed to changes in laws governing our employee
relationships in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, including laws and
regulations regarding wage and hour requirements, fair labor standards,
employee data privacy, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates,
citizenship requirements and payroll and other taxes, which likely would have
a direct impact on our operating costs.

Increasing regulatory focus on privacy and security issues and expanding laws
could impact our business models and expose us to increased liability.

As a global company, Adobe is subject to global data protection, privacy and
security laws, regulations and codes of conduct that apply to our various
business units and data processing activities. These laws, regulations and
codes may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and
differing (sometimes conflicting) interpretations. Government officials and
regulators, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly
scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit
personal data. This increased scrutiny may result in new interpretations of
existing laws, thereby further impacting Adobe's business. Globally, laws such
as the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") in Europe and the Personal
Information Protection Law ("PIPL") in China, and new and emerging state laws
in the United States on privacy, data and related technologies, such as the
California Consumer Privacy Act, the California Privacy Rights Act and the
Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, as well as industry self-regulatory
codes, create new compliance obligations and expand the scope of potential
liability, either jointly or severally with our customers and suppliers. While
we have invested in readiness to comply with applicable requirements, the
dynamic and evolving nature of these laws, regulations and codes, as well as
their interpretation by regulators and courts, may affect our ability (and our
enterprise customers' ability) to reach current and prospective customers, to
respond to both enterprise and individual customer requests under the laws
(such as individual rights of access, correction and deletion of their
personal information) and to implement our business models effectively. These
laws, regulations and codes may also impact our innovation and business
drivers in developing new and emerging technologies (e.g., artificial
intelligence and machine learning). These requirements, among others, may
impact demand for our offerings and force us to bear the burden of more
onerous obligations in our contracts. Any perception of our practices,
products or services as a violation of individual privacy or data protection
rights may subject us to public criticism, class action lawsuits, reputational
harm, or investigations or claims by regulators, industry groups or other
third parties, all of which could disrupt or adversely impact our business and
expose us to increased liability. Additionally, we collect and store
information on behalf of our business customers and if our customers fail to
comply with contractual obligations or applicable laws, it could result in
litigation or reputational harm to us.

Transferring personal information across international borders is complex and
subject to legal and regulatory requirements as well as active litigation and
enforcement in a number of jurisdictions around the world, each of which could
have an adverse impact on our ability to process and transfer personal data as
part of our business operations. For example, European data transfers outside
the European Economic Area are highly regulated and litigated. The mechanisms
that we and many other companies rely upon for European data transfers (e.g.,
Standard Contractual Clauses) are the subject of regulatory interpretation and
judicial decisions by the Court of Justice of the European Union. We are
closely monitoring for developments related to valid transfer mechanisms
available for transferring personal data outside the European Economic Area
(including the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework) and other countries that
have similar trans-border data flow requirements and adjusting our practices
accordingly. The open judicial questions and regulatory interpretations
related to the validity of transfers using Standard Contractual Clauses have
resulted in some changes in the obligations required to provide our services
in the European Union and could expose us to potential sanctions and fines for
non-compliance. Several other countries, including China, Australia, New
Zealand, Brazil, Hong Kong and Japan, have also established specific legal
requirements for cross-border transfers of personal information and for data
localization (i.e., where personal data must remain stored in the country). If
other countries implement more restrictive regulations for cross-border data
transfers or do not permit data to leave the country of origin, such
developments could adversely impact our business and our enterprise customers'
business, our financial condition and our results of operations in those
jurisdictions.

Our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset and we may not be able
to protect our intellectual property rights, including our source code, from
infringement or unauthorized copying, use or disclosure.

Our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset. Infringement or
misappropriation of our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and
other intellectual property rights could result in lost revenues and
ultimately reduce their value. Preventing unauthorized use or infringement of
our intellectual property rights is inherently difficult. We actively combat
software piracy as we enforce our intellectual property rights, but we
nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of our software. If
piracy activities continue at historical levels or increase, they may further
harm our business. We apply for patents in the United States and
internationally to protect our newly created technology and if we are unable
to obtain patent protection for the technology described in our pending
patent, or if the patent is not obtained timely, this could result in revenue
loss, or have other adverse effects on operations and harm our business. We
offer our products and services in foreign countries

28

* * *

Table of Contents

and we may seek intellectual property protection from those foreign legal
systems. Some of those foreign countries may not have as robust or
comprehensive of intellectual property protection laws and schemes as those
offered in the United States, and the mechanisms to enforce intellectual
property rights may be inadequate to protect our technology, which could harm
our business. We also seek to protect our confidential information and trade
secrets through the use of non-disclosure agreements with our customers,
contractors, vendors and partners. However, there is a risk that our
confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published
without our authorization, and in these situations, enforcing our rights may
be difficult or costly.

If unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs through security breach,
cyber-attack or otherwise, we could lose future trade secret protection for
that source code. Such loss could make it easier for third parties to compete
with our products by copying functionality, which could cause us to lose
customers and could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins.

We may incur substantial costs defending against third parties alleging that
we infringe their proprietary rights.

We have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims,
negotiations and complex, protracted litigation relating to disputes regarding
the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property
rights, including patent rights. Intellectual property disputes and litigation
are typically costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by
diverting the attention of management and key personnel. We may not prevail in
every lawsuit or dispute. Third-party intellectual property disputes,
including those initiated by patent assertion entities, could subject us to
significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing
arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from offering certain products
or services, subject us to injunctions restricting our sales, cause severe
disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require
us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers, including
contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service
agreements. In addition, we may incur significant costs in acquiring the
necessary third-party intellectual property rights for use in our products, in
some cases to fulfill contractual obligations with our customers. Any of these
occurrences could significantly harm our business.

Changes in accounting principles or interpretations thereof could have a
significant impact on our financial position and results of operations.

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). These
principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed
to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. A change in these
principles, how the principles are interpreted, or the adoption of new
accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results,
could retroactively affect previously reported transactions and may require
that we make significant changes to our systems, processes and controls.

Changes resulting from these new standards may result in materially different
financial results and may require that we change how we process, analyze and
report financial information and that we change financial reporting controls.
For additional information regarding new standards that may have significant
impact to our consolidated financial statements, see the section titled
"Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective" in Note 1 of our Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Such changes in accounting principles may have an adverse effect on our
business, financial position and results of operations, or cause an adverse
deviation from our revenue and profitability targets, which may negatively
impact our financial results.

Changes in tax rules and regulations or interpretations thereof may adversely
affect our effective tax rates.

We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple
domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in
determining our current provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets or
liabilities. Tax laws in the United States and in foreign tax jurisdictions
are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new
interpretations are issued. The applicability and impact of changes in tax
laws and interpretations thereof could adversely affect our effective income
tax rate and cash flows in future years.

Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of
operations. Our future effective tax rates are likely to be unfavorably
affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is
earned, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be
earned and taxed, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and
liabilities, changes in or interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the
jurisdictions in which we do business, or unexpected negative changes in
business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits.

In addition, the United States and other countries and jurisdictions in which
we conduct business, including those covered by governing bodies that enact
tax laws applicable to us, such as the European Commission of the European
Union,

29

* * *

Table of Contents

could make changes to relevant tax, accounting or other laws and
interpretations thereof that have a material impact to us. These countries,
governmental bodies and intergovernmental economic organizations such as the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, have or could make
unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined and, in some cases,
have proposed or enacted new laws that are contrary to the way in which rules
and regulations have historically been interpreted and applied. In the current
global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and
interpretations could adversely affect our effective tax rates, cause us to
respond by making changes to our business structure, or result in other costs
to us which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.

Moreover, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by
domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of
outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our
provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that
may result from these examinations. We believe our tax estimates to be
reasonable; however, we cannot provide assurance that the final determination
of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our financial
position and results of operations.

Contracting with government entities exposes us to additional risks inherent
in the government procurement process.

We provide products and services, directly and indirectly, to a variety of
domestic and foreign government entities, which introduces certain risks,
including extended sales and collection cycles, varying governmental budgeting
processes and adherence to complex procurement regulations and other
government-specific contractual requirements. We have been, are currently and
may in the future be subject to audits and investigations relating to our
government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and
criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of
contracts, payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government
business, as well as harm to our reputation and financial results.

Risks Related to Financial Performance

If our customers fail to renew subscriptions in accordance with our
expectations, our future revenue and operating results could suffer, and our
subscription offerings may create additional risk related to the timing of
revenue recognition.

Our offerings are typically subscription-based, pursuant to product and
service agreements. Since our customers have no obligation to renew their
subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their initial
subscription period, which typically ranges from 1 to 36 months, our customers
may not renew their subscriptions at the same or a higher level of service,
for the same number of seats or for the same duration of time, if at all. Our
varied customer base and flexible duration complicates our ability to
precisely forecast renewal rates. Our customers' renewal rates may decline or
fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of
satisfaction with our services, our ability to continue enhancing features and
functionality, the reliability (including uptime) of our subscription
offerings, the prices of offerings and competitors' offerings, the actual or
perceived information security of our systems and services, decreases in the
size of our customer base, reductions in our customers' spending levels or
declines in customer activity as a result of general economic conditions or
uncertainty in financial markets, including as a result of a global health
crisis and geopolitical conflict, which has affected and may continue to
affect certain sectors of the economy disproportionately. If our customers do
not renew their subscriptions or if they renew on terms less favorable to us,
our revenue may decline.

We generally recognize revenue from our subscription offerings ratably over
the terms of their subscription agreements. As a result, most of the
subscription revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription
agreements entered into during previous quarters. Any reduction in new or
renewed subscriptions in a quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results
until a later quarter and may decrease our revenue in future quarters. Lower
sales, reduced demand for our products and services and increases in our
attrition rate may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until
future periods. Our subscription model could also make it difficult for us to
rapidly increase our revenue from subscription-based or hosted services
through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers will be
recognized over the applicable subscription term.

Additionally, in connection with our sales efforts to enterprise customers, a
number of factors could affect our revenue, including longer-than-expected
sales and implementation cycles, potential deferral of revenue and alternative
licensing arrangements. If any of our assumptions about revenue from our
subscription-based offerings prove incorrect, our actual results may vary
materially from those anticipated.

We may incur losses associated with currency fluctuations and may not be able
to effectively hedge our exposure.

Our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates due to the global scope of our business. Geopolitical and economic
events, including war, trade disputes, economic sanctions and emerging market
volatility, and associated uncertainty have caused, and may in the future
cause, currencies to fluctuate. We attempt to mitigate a portion of these
risks through foreign currency hedging based on our judgment of the
appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity and expense. We regularly
review our hedging program and make adjustments that we believe are
appropriate. Our hedging

activities have not and may not in the future offset more than a portion of
the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign
currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition
or results of operations.

If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, then we
could be required to record a significant charge to earnings.

GAAP requires us to test for goodwill impairment at least annually. In
addition, we review our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets for
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value
may not be recoverable, including declines in stock price, market
capitalization or cash flows, and slower growth rates in our industry.
Depending on the results of our review, we could be required to record a
significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during
the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible
assets was determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.

We have issued $4.15 billion of notes in debt offerings and may incur other
debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and
future financial results.

We have $4.15 billion in senior unsecured notes and a $1.5 billion senior
unsecured revolving credit agreement, which is currently undrawn. This debt
may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by,
among other things:

•increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and
industry conditions;

•requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash flows from
operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash
flows available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and
acquisitions; and

•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our
business and our industry.

Our senior unsecured notes and senior unsecured credit agreement impose
restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified
covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by
events beyond our control. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain
a waiver from the noteholders or lenders, then, subject to applicable cure
periods, any outstanding debt may be declared immediately due and payable.

In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively
impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well
as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. Under
certain circumstances, if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative
action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit
facility could increase. Downgrades in our credit ratings could also restrict
our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and affect the terms
of any such financing.

Our investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the financial
markets.

Our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of December 2, 2022
consisted of asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, foreign
government securities, money market funds, municipal securities, time
deposits, U.S. agency securities and U.S. Treasury securities. We follow an
established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help
mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth
credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as
our maximum exposure to various asset classes.

Should financial market conditions worsen in the future, including from
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or the Russia-Ukraine war, investments in
some financial instruments may pose risks arising from market liquidity and
credit concerns. In addition, any deterioration of the capital markets could
cause our other income and expense to vary from expectations. As of December
2, 2022, we had no material impairment charges associated with our short-term
investment portfolio, and although we believe our current investment portfolio
has little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market
conditions, market liquidity or credit availability, and we can provide no
assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired.

General Risk Factors

Catastrophic events, including global pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic,
may disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial condition and
results of operations.

We are a highly automated business and rely on our network infrastructure and
enterprise applications, internal technology systems and website for our
development, marketing, operations, support, hosted services and sales
activities. In

31

* * *

Table of Contents

addition, some of our businesses rely on third-party hosted services, and we
do not control the operation of third-party data center facilities serving our
customers from around the world, which increases our vulnerability. A
disruption, infiltration or failure of these systems or third-party hosted
services in the event of a major earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other
weather event, power loss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware
malfunctions, pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), cyber-attack, war,
terrorist attack or other catastrophic event that our disaster recovery plans
do not adequately address, could cause system interruptions, reputational
harm, loss of intellectual property, delays in our product development,
lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss of
critical data. Any of these events could prevent us from fulfilling our
customers' orders or could negatively impact a country or region in which we
sell our products, which could in turn decrease that country's or region's
demand for our products. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of
our research and development activities, certain of our data centers and
certain other critical business operations are located in the San Francisco
Bay Area, and additional facilities where we conduct significant operations
are located in the Salt Lake Valley Area, both of which are near major
earthquake faults. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or
disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information
technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal
business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be
adversely affected. The adverse effects of any such catastrophic event would
be exacerbated if experienced at the same time as another unexpected and
adverse event, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

The occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as the
COVID-19 pandemic, have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on how
we and our customers are operating our businesses and our operating results.
Our operations have also been and may in the future be negatively affected by
a range of external factors related to the pandemic that are not within our
control, including the emergence and spread of more transmissible variants.
The extent to which global pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, impact
our financial condition or results of operations will depend on factors such
as the duration and scope of the pandemic, as well as whether there is a
material impact on the businesses or productivity of our customers, partners,
employee, suppliers and other partners. To the extent that the pandemic harms
our business and results of operations, many of the other risks described in
this Part I, Item 1A of this report may be heightened.

Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business.

While we seek to partner with organizations that mitigate their business risks
associated with climate change, we recognize that there are inherent risks
wherever business is conducted. Access to clean water and reliable energy in
the communities where we conduct our business, whether for our offices or for
our vendors, is a priority. Our major sites in California, Utah and India are
vulnerable to climate change effects. For example, in California, increasing
intensity of drought throughout the state and annual periods of wildfire
danger increase the probability of planned power outages in the communities
where we work and live. While this danger has a low-assessed risk of
disrupting normal business operations, it has the potential impact on
employees' abilities to commute to work or to work from home and stay
connected effectively. Climate-related events, including the increasing
frequency of extreme weather events and their impact on U.S., India and other
major regions' critical infrastructure, have the potential to disrupt our
business, our third-party suppliers and/or the business of our customers, and
may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to
maintain or resume operations. To inform our disclosures and take potential
action as appropriate, Adobe is aligned with the guidelines of the Financial
Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures
recommendations and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and the
Global Reporting Initiative environmental metrics. Regulatory developments,
changing market dynamics and stakeholder expectations regarding climate change
may impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Uncertainty about current and future economic conditions and other adverse
changes in general political conditions in any of the major countries in which
we do business could adversely affect our operating results.

As our business has grown, we have become increasingly subject to the risks
arising from adverse changes in economic and political conditions, both
domestically and globally, including trends toward protectionism and
nationalism, other unfavorable changes in economic conditions, such as
inflation, rising interest rates or a recession, and other events beyond our
control, such as economic sanctions, natural disasters, pandemics, including
the COVID-19 pandemic, epidemics, political instability, armed conflicts and
wars, including the Russia-Ukraine war. Worsening economic conditions have had
and may continue to have an adverse impact on the businesses and financial
health of many of our customers and hurt their creditworthiness. As a result,
current or potential customers may be unable to fund software purchases, which
could cause them to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and
services. Uncertainty about the effects of current and future economic and
political conditions on us, our customers, suppliers and partners makes it
difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about
future investments. If economic growth in countries where we do business
slows, customers may delay or reduce technology purchases, advertising
spending or marketing spending. This could result in reductions in sales of
our products and services, more extended sales cycles, slower adoption of new
technologies and increased price competition. Among our customers are
government entities, including the U.S. federal government, and our revenue
could decline if spending cuts impact the government's ability to purchase our
products and services. Deterioration in economic conditions in

32

Table of Contents

any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower or
impaired collections on accounts receivable, which may adversely impact our
liquidity and financial condition. A disruption in financial markets could
impair our banking partners, on which we rely for operating cash management
and derivative programs. Any of these events would likely harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Revenue, margin or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market
generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline.

In the past, the market price for our common stock experienced significant
fluctuations and it may do so in the future. A number of factors may affect
the market price for our common stock, such as:

•shortfalls in, or changes in expectations about, our revenue, margins,
earnings, Annualized Recurring Revenue ("ARR"), sales of our Digital
Experience offerings or other key performance metrics;

•changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;

•whether our results meet analysts' expectations;

•compression or expansion of multiples used by investors and analysts to value
high technology SaaS companies;

•the announcement of new products or services, product enhancements, service
introductions, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or our
competitors;

•the loss of large customers or our inability to increase sales to existing
customers, retain customers or attract new customers;

•recruitment or departure of key personnel;

•variations in our or our competitors' results of operations, changes in the
competitive landscape generally and developments in our industry;

•general socio-economic, political or market conditions;

•macroeconomic conditions and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,
inflation and rising interest rates and global conflicts, including the
Russia-Ukraine war; and

•unusual events such as significant acquisitions by us or our competitors,
divestitures, litigation, regulatory actions and other factors, including
factors unrelated to our operating performance.

In addition, the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general
may experience uneven investor confidence, which may cause the market price
for our common stock to decline for reasons unrelated to our operating
performance. Volatility in the market price of a company's securities for a
period of time may increase the company's susceptibility to securities class
action litigation. Oftentimes, this type of litigation is expensive and
diverts management's attention and resources which may adversely affect our
business.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated
Financial Statements and Notes thereto. Discussion regarding our financial
condition and results of operations for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020
is included in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 3, 2021, filed with the SEC on January 21, 2022.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP and
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions,
judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on
historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate
our assumptions, judgments and estimates on a regular basis. We also discuss
our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the
Board of Directors.

We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the
accounting for revenue recognition, business combinations and income taxes
have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on
complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, and consequently,
we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our
assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting
policies have not differed materially from actual results.

Revenue Recognition

Our contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For
example, some of our offerings include both on-premise and/or on-device
software licenses and cloud services. Determining whether the software
licenses and the cloud services are distinct from each other, and therefore
performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from
each other, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may require
significant judgment. We have concluded that the on-premise/on-device software
licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud
subscription offerings are not distinct from each other such that revenue from
each offering should be recognized ratably over the subscription period for
which the cloud services are provided. In reaching this conclusion, we
considered the nature of our promise to Creative Cloud and Document Cloud
customers, which is to provide a complete end-to-end creative design or
document workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple devices
and teams. We fulfill this promise by providing access to a solution that
integrates cloud-based and on-premise/on-device features that, together
through their integration, provide functionalities, utility and workflow
efficiencies that could not be obtained from either the on-premise/on-device
software or cloud services on their own.

Cloud-based features that are integral to our Creative Cloud and Document
Cloud offerings and that work together with the on-premise/on-device software
include, but are not limited to: Creative Cloud Libraries, which enable
customers to access their work, settings, preferences and other assets
seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices and collaborate across teams in
real time; shared reviews which enable simultaneous editing and commenting of
digital assets across desktop, mobile and web; automatic cloud rendering of a
design which enables it to be worked on in multiple mediums; and Sensei,
Adobe's cloud-hosted artificial intelligence and machine learning framework,
which enables features such as automated photo-editing, photograph content-
awareness, natural language processing, optical character recognition and
automated document tagging.

Business Combinations

We allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to tangible and
intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated
fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process
requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect
to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations. Although we believe the
assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part
on historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from
management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have
acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:

•future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions,
support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies
and patents;

•expected costs to develop acquired technologies and patents internally into
commercially viable products;

36

* * *

Table of Contents

•historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in
revenue from acquired customers;

•the acquired company's trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about
the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be
used in the combined company's product portfolio;

•the expected use of the acquired assets; and

•discount rates.

In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we
estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed. The
estimated fair value of these obligations is determined utilizing a cost
build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by
estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal
profit margin.

Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy
or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.

Accounting for Income Taxes

We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under
this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable
or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of
temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets
and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
Significant judgment is required in determining our current provision for
income taxes and deferred tax assets or liabilities. We record a valuation
allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount for which realization is
more likely than not.

Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for
income taxes take into account our interpretation and application of current
tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future examinations conducted by
domestic and foreign tax authorities. We have established reserves for income
taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be
challenged by tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes
resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision
for income taxes and associated reserves. To the extent that the final
determination of any of these examinations is different from the amounts
recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes and the
effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information
regarding recent accounting pronouncements that are of significance, or
potential significance to us.

ACQUISITIONS

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the acquisition of
Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a cloud-based video
collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion and we began
integrating Frame.io into our Digital Media reportable segment. In the first
quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the acquisition of Workfront, a privately
held company that provides a workflow platform, for approximately $1.52
billion in cash consideration and we began integrating Workfront into our
Digital Experience reportable segment. See Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview of 2022

For our fiscal 2022, we experienced strong demand across our Digital Media and
Digital Experience offerings, driven by the ongoing shift towards a digital-
first world. As we execute on our long-term growth initiatives, we have
continued to experience growth in software-based subscription revenue across
our portfolio of offerings.

Digital Media

In our Digital Media segment, we are a market leader with Creative Cloud, our
subscription-based offering which provides desktop tools, mobile apps and
cloud-based services for designing, creating and publishing rich content and
immersive 3D experiences. Starting in December 2021, Creative Cloud includes
Adobe Express, a web and mobile application designed to enable a broad
spectrum of users, including novice content creators, communicators and
creative professionals, to create, edit and customize content quickly and
easily with content-first, task-based solutions. Creative Cloud delivers value
with deep, cross-product integration, frequent product updates and feature
enhancements, cloud-enabled services including storage and

37

* * *

Table of Contents

syncing of files across users' devices, machine learning and artificial
intelligence, access to marketplace, social and community-based features with
our Adobe Stock and Behance services, app creation capabilities, tools which
assist with enterprise deployments and team collaboration, and affordable
pricing for cost-sensitive customers.

We offer Creative Cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises. We
expect Creative Cloud will drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a
continued expansion of our customer base by attracting new users with new
features and products like Adobe Express that make creative tools accessible
to first-time creators and communicators, and delivering new features and
technologies to existing customers with our latest releases such as share for
review. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to
enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service.
Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase
our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow our recurring and
predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.

We continue to implement strategies that are designed to accelerate awareness,
consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our Creative Cloud offerings.
These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive,
such as offering new desktop, web and mobile applications, as well as targeted
promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to
experience and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift
towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term License Agreements
("ETLAs"), revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products has been
immaterial to our business.

We are also a market leader with our Document Cloud offerings built around our
Adobe Acrobat family of products, with a set of integrated mobile apps and
cloud-based document services which enable users to create, review, approve,
sign and track documents regardless of platform or application source type.
Document Cloud, which enhances the way people manage critical documents at
home, in the office and across devices, includes Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Acrobat
Sign and Adobe Scan. Adobe Acrobat is offered both through subscription and
perpetual licenses.

As part of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud strategies, we utilize a
data-driven operating model ("DDOM") and our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions
to raise awareness of our products, drive new customer acquisition, engagement
and retention, and optimize customer journeys, and it continues to contribute
strong growth in the business.

Annualized Recurring Revenue ("ARR") is currently the key performance metric
our management uses to assess the health and trajectory of our overall Digital
Media segment. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue
and remaining performance obligations as ARR is a performance metric and is
not intended to be combined with any of these items. We adjust our reported
ARR on an annual basis to reflect any exchange rate changes. Our reported ARR
results in the current fiscal year are based on currency rates set at the
beginning of the year and held constant throughout the year for measurement
purposes. We calculate ARR as follows:

| | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Creative ARR| Annual Value of Creative Cloud Subscriptions and Services  
\+  
Annual Creative ETLA Contract Value  
Document Cloud ARR| Annual Value of Document Cloud Subscriptions and Services  
+  
Annual Document Cloud ETLA Contract Value  
Digital Media ARR| Creative ARR  
\+  
Document Cloud ARR  
  
In March 2022, in response to the Russia-Ukraine war, we announced a halt of
all new sales of our products and services in Russia and Belarus. As a result,
we reduced our Digital Media ARR balance by $75 million, which represented our
Digital Media ARR for existing business in Russia and Belarus. While we
continued to provide Digital Media services in Ukraine, we also reduced our
Digital Media ARR balance by an additional $12 million, which represented our
Digital Media business in Ukraine. This resulted in a total ARR reduction of
$87 million taken at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2022.

Creative ARR exiting fiscal 2022 was $11.60 billion, up from $10.22 billion at
the end of fiscal 2021. Document Cloud ARR exiting fiscal 2022 was $2.37
billion, up from $1.93 billion at the end of fiscal 2021. Total Digital Media
ARR grew to $13.97 billion at the end of fiscal 2022, up from $12.15 billion
at the end of fiscal 2021. Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal 2022 using
currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2023, our Digital Media ARR at the
end of fiscal 2022 would be $13.26 billion or approximately $712 million lower
than the ARR reported above.

Our success in driving growth in ARR has positively affected our revenue
growth. Creative revenue in fiscal 2022 was $10.46 billion, up from $9.55
billion in fiscal 2021 and representing 10% year-over-year growth. Document
Cloud revenue in fiscal 2022 was $2.38 billion, up from $1.97 billion in
fiscal 2021 and representing 21% year-over-year growth. Total Digital Media
segment revenue grew to $12.84 billion in fiscal 2022, up from $11.52 billion
in fiscal 2021 and representing 11% year-over-year growth driven by strong net
new user growth.

Digital Experience

We are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our Digital
Experience segment. The Adobe Experience Cloud applications, services and
platform are designed to manage customer journeys, enable personalized
experiences at scale and deliver intelligence for businesses of any size in
any industry. Our differentiation and competitive advantage are strengthened
by our ability to use the Adobe Experience Platform to integrate our
comprehensive set of solutions.

Adobe Experience Cloud delivers solutions for our customers across the
following strategic growth pillars:

•Data insights and audiences. Our solutions, including Adobe Analytics, Adobe
Experience Platform, Customer Journey Analytics, Adobe Audience Manager and
our Real-time Customer Data Platform, deliver robust customer profiles and AI-
powered analytics across the customer journey to provide timely, relevant
experiences across platforms.

•Content and commerce. Our solutions help customers manage, deliver and
optimize content delivery through Adobe Experience Manager, and enable
shopping experiences that scale from mid-market to enterprise businesses with
Adobe Commerce.

•Customer journeys. Our solutions help businesses manage, test, target,
personalize and orchestrate campaigns and customer journeys across B2E use
cases, including through Marketo Engage, Adobe Campaign, Adobe Target and
Journey Optimizer.

•Marketing workflow. We offer Adobe Workfront, a work management platform
directed toward marketers to orchestrate campaign workflows.

In addition to chief marketing officers, chief revenue officers and digital
marketers, users of our Digital Experience solutions include advertisers,
campaign managers, publishers, data analysts, content managers, social
marketers, marketing executives and information management and technology
executives. These customers often are involved in workflows that utilize other
Adobe products, such as our Digital Media offerings. By combining the
creativity of our Digital Media business with the science of our Digital
Experience business, we help our customers to more efficiently and effectively
make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an
end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.

We utilize a direct sales force to market and license our Digital Experience
solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners, including marketing
agencies, systems integrators and independent software vendors that help
license and deploy our solutions to their customers. We have made significant
investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market,
and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments.

Digital Experience revenue was $4.42 billion in fiscal 2022, up from $3.87
billion in fiscal 2021 which represents 14% year-over-year growth. Driving
this increase was the increase in subscription revenue across our offerings
which grew to $3.88 billion in fiscal 2022 from $3.38 billion in fiscal 2021,
representing 15% year-over-year growth.

Macroeconomic Conditions

As a corporation with an extensive global footprint, we are subject to risks
and exposures from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations caused by
significant events with macroeconomic impacts, including, but not limited to,
the Russia-Ukraine war, COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by central banks
to counter inflation. We continuously monitor the direct and indirect impacts
of these circumstances on our business and financial results, as well as the
overall global economy and geopolitical landscape. Foreign currency exchange
rate fluctuations have negatively impacted our revenue and earnings during
fiscal 2022, and are expected to continue to negatively impact our financial
results in fiscal 2023.

While our revenue and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our
subscription-based business model, the broader implications of these
macroeconomic events on our business, results of operations and overall
financial position, particularly in the long term, remain uncertain. See the
section titled "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of this report for further
discussion of the possible impact of these macroeconomic issues on our
business.

Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2022

•Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $13.97 billion as of December 2,
2022 increased by $1.82 billion, or 15%, from $12.15 billion as of December 3,
2021. The change in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to new user
adoption of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, partially offset
by an $87 million ARR reduction taken in March 2022 in response to the Russia-
Ukraine war.

•Creative revenue of $10.46 billion increased by $913 million, or 10%, during
fiscal 2022, from $9.55 billion in fiscal 2021. Document Cloud revenue of
$2.38 billion increased by $409 million, or 21%, during fiscal 2022, from
$1.97 billion in fiscal 2021. The increases were primarily due to subscription
revenue growth associated with our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud
offerings.

•Digital Experience revenue of $4.42 billion increased by $555 million, or
14%, during fiscal 2022, from $3.87 billion in fiscal 2021. The increase was
primarily due to subscription revenue growth across our offerings.

•Remaining performance obligations of $15.19 billion as of December 2, 2022
increased by $1.20 billion, or 9%, from $13.99 billion as of December 3, 2021,
primarily due to new contracts and renewals for our Digital Media and Digital
Experience offerings, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations.

•Cost of revenue of $2.17 billion increased by $300 million, or 16%, during
fiscal 2022, from $1.87 billion in fiscal 2021 primarily due to increases in
hosting services and data center costs, as well as increases in base and
incentive compensation and related benefits costs.

•Operating expenses of $9.34 billion increased by $1.23 billion, or 15%,
during fiscal 2022, from $8.12 billion in fiscal 2021 primarily due to
increases in base and incentive compensation and related benefits costs, as
well as increased marketing spend.

•Cash flows from operations of $7.84 billion during fiscal 2022 increased by
$608 million, or 8%, from $7.23 billion in fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher
net income after adjustment for non-cash items.

Revenue

Revenue for fiscal 2021 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of
fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2021 was a
53-week year compared with fiscal 2022 and 2020 which were 52-week years.

Product

Our product revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to licenses for on-
premise software purchased on a perpetual basis, for a fixed period of time or
based on usage for certain of our OEM and royalty agreements. We primarily
recognize product revenue at the point in time the software is available to
the customer, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met.

Services and Other

Our services and other revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to
consulting, training, maintenance and support for certain on-premise licenses
that are recognized at a point in time and our advertising offerings. We
typically sell our consulting contracts on a time-and-materials or fixed-fee
basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are performed for time-
and-materials contracts and on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee
contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Our
maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers, partners and
developers to receive desktop product upgrades and enhancements or technical
support, depending on the offering, are generally recognized ratably over the
term of the arrangement. Transaction-based advertising revenue is recognized
on a usage basis as we satisfy the performance obligations to our customers.

Digital Media

Revenue by major offerings in our Digital Media reportable segment for fiscal
2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

Total Digital Media revenue| | $| 12,842 | | | $| 11,520 | | | $| 9,233 | | |
11 | %  
  
Revenue from Digital Media increased $1.32 billion during fiscal 2022 as
compared to fiscal 2021, driven by increases in revenue associated with our
Creative and Document Cloud subscription offerings due to continued demand
amid an increasingly digital environment and strong customer acquisition and
engagement, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations.

Digital Experience

Revenue from Digital Experience increased $555 million during fiscal 2022 as
compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to net new additions across our
subscription offerings, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations.

Overall revenue during fiscal 2022 increased in all geographic regions as
compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to increases in Digital Media revenue
and, to a lesser extent, increases in Digital Experience revenue. Within each
geographic region, the fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were
attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above.

Included in the overall change in revenue for fiscal 2022 as compared to
fiscal 2021 were impacts associated with foreign currency which were mitigated
in part by our foreign currency hedging program. During fiscal 2022, the U.S.
Dollar primarily strengthened against EMEA and APAC foreign currencies as
compared to fiscal 2021, which decreased revenue in U.S. Dollar equivalents by
approximately $486 million. During fiscal 2022, the foreign currency impacts
to revenue were offset in part by net hedging gains from our cash flow hedging
program of $176 million.

See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
details of revenue by geography.

Interest Expense

Interest expense represents interest associated with our debt instruments.
Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February
1 and August 1.

Investment Gains (Losses), Net

Investment gains (losses), net consists principally of unrealized holding
gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets, and
gains and losses associated with our direct and indirect investments in
privately held companies.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on cash,
cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments. Other income
(expense), net also includes realized gains and losses on fixed income
investments and foreign exchange gains and losses.

Other income (expense), increased during fiscal 2022 primarily due to
increases in interest income driven by higher average interest rates.

Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes

(1,084)| | | 42 | %| |  
Percentage of total revenue| | 7 | %| | 6 | %| | (8)| %| |  | |  
Effective tax rate| | 21 | %| | 15 | %| | (26)| %| |  | |  
  
Our effective tax rate increased by approximately six percentage points during
fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower tax benefits
related to stock-based compensation in fiscal 2022.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was the same as the U.S. federal
statutory tax rate primarily due to the impact of the U.S. federal research
tax credit, largely offset by state taxes.

During fiscal 2020, we completed intra-entity transfers of certain IP rights
to our Irish subsidiary in order to better align the ownership of these rights
with how our business operates. The transfers did not result in taxable gains;
however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and
tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these
transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and
related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP
rights transferred. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred
IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit.

We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets
are more likely than not to be realized based on evaluation of all available
positive and negative evidence. On the basis of this evaluation, we continue
to maintain a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the
amount realizable. The total valuation allowance was $402 million as of
December 2, 2022, primarily related to certain state credits.

We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple
domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions. The current U.S. tax law subjects the
earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to U.S. tax and generally allows an
exemption from taxation for distributions from foreign subsidiaries.

In the current global tax policy environment, the domestic and foreign
governing bodies continue to consider, and in some cases introduce, changes in
regulations applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. As
regulations are issued, we account for finalized regulations in the period of
enactment.

See Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information regarding our provision for (benefit from) income taxes.

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

The gross liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and
penalties were $321 million, $289 million and $201 million for fiscal 2022,
2021 and 2020, respectively. If the total unrecognized tax benefits as of
December 2, 2022, December 3, 2021 and November 27, 2020 were recognized, $203
million, $199 million and $136 million would decrease the respective effective
tax rates.

As of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, the combined amounts of accrued
interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns were
approximately $17 million and $22 million, respectively. These amounts were
included in long-term income taxes payable in their respective years.

The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as
are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit
settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance
sheet classification of our tax assets and liabilities. We believe that within
the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will
conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods
will expire, or both. Although the timing of resolution, settlement and
closing of audits is not certain, it is reasonably possible that the
underlying unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $25 million over
the next 12 months.

Our future effective tax rates may be materially affected by changes in the
tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, changes in
jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed,
changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes
in or interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in
which we do business, or unexpected changes in business and market conditions
that could reduce certain tax benefits.

In addition, the United States and other countries and jurisdictions in which
we conduct business, including those covered by governing bodies that enact
tax laws applicable to us, such as the European Commission of the European
Union, could make changes to relevant tax, accounting or other laws and
interpretations thereof that have a material impact to us. These countries,
governmental bodies and intergovernmental economic organizations such as the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, have or could make
unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined and, in some cases,
have proposed or enacted new laws that are contrary to the way in which rules
and regulations have historically been interpreted and applied. In the current
global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and
interpretations could adversely affect our effective tax rates, cause us to
respond by making changes to our business structure, or result in other costs
to us which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.

Moreover, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by
domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of
outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our
provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that
may result from these examinations. Our policy is to record interest and
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We
believe our tax estimates to be reasonable; however, we cannot provide
assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not
have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.

Cash Flows

This data should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows.

A summary of our cash flows for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
(in millions)| 2022| | 2021| | 2020  
Net cash provided by operating activities| $| 7,838 | | | $| 7,230 | | | $|

| | (26)| | | 3 |  
Net change in cash and cash equivalents| $| 392 | | | $| (634)| | | $| 1,828 |  
  
Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. Our primary uses of cash
are our stock repurchase program as described below and general business
expenses including payroll, marketing and third-party hosting services. Other
sources of cash include proceeds from participation in the employee stock
purchase plan. Other uses of cash include business acquisitions, purchases of
property and equipment and payments for taxes related to net share settlement
of equity awards.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

For fiscal 2022, net cash provided by operating activities of $7.84 billion
was primarily comprised of net income adjusted for the net effect of non-cash
items. The primary working capital sources of cash were increases in deferred
revenue driven by Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings, partially
offset by increases in trade receivables attributable to the timing of
billings.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

For fiscal 2022, net cash used for investing activities of $570 million was
primarily due to ongoing capital expenditures and business acquisitions. See
Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information regarding these acquisitions.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

For fiscal 2022, net cash used for financing activities of $6.83 billion was
primarily due to payments for our common stock repurchases and taxes paid
related to the net share settlement of equity awards, offset in part by
proceeds from re-issuance of treasury stock mainly for our employee stock
purchase plan. See the section titled "Stock Repurchase Program" below.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Considerations

Our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate
during fiscal 2023 due to changes in our planned cash outlay.

Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and
uncertainties, including, but not limited to, risks detailed in the section
titled "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of this report. Based on our current
business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, cash
equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from
operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our
working capital, operating resource expenditure and capital expenditure
requirements for the next twelve months.

Our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of December 2, 2022
consisted of asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, foreign
government securities, money market funds, municipal securities, time
deposits, U.S. agency

securities and U.S. Treasury securities. We use professional investment
management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash.

We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-
term investments, purchases of computer systems for research and development,
sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff, and facilities
expansion. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under
our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products
or technologies that are complementary to our business.

On September 15, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we
intend to acquire Figma, Inc. ("Figma") for approximately $20 billion,
comprised of approximately half cash and half stock, subject to customary
purchase price adjustments. Approximately 6 million additional restricted
stock units will be granted to Figma's Chief Executive Officer and employees
that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is
subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and is
expected to close in 2023. We will be required to pay Figma a reverse
termination fee of $1 billion if the transaction fails to receive regulatory
clearance, assuming all other closing conditions have been satisfied or
waived, or if it fails to close within 18 months from September 15, 2022. We
expect to finance the cash portion of the consideration using cash on hand and
short-term debt instruments. While the transaction is pending, at a minimum we
expect to maintain share repurchases sufficient to offset the dilution of
equity issuances to our employees.

Revolving Credit Agreement

During 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the "Revolving Credit
Agreement") with a syndicate of lenders, providing for a five-year $1.5
billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility through June 30, 2027,
which replaces our previous five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving
credit agreement dated as of October 17, 2018. Subject to the agreement of
lenders, we may obtain up to an additional $500 million in commitments, for a
maximum aggregate commitment of $2 billion. As of December 2, 2022, there were
no outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement and the entire $1.5
billion credit line remains available for borrowing.

Under the terms of our Revolving Credit Agreement, we are not prohibited from
paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or if
one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the
foreseeable future.

Senior Notes

We have $4.15 billion senior notes outstanding, which rank equally with our
other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. As of December 2, 2022, the
carrying value of our senior notes was $4.13 billion and our maximum
commitment for interest payments was $416 million for the remaining duration
of our outstanding senior notes. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears
on February 1 and August 1. Our senior notes do not contain any financial
covenants. See Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
further details regarding our debt.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we reclassified the senior notes due
February 1, 2023 as current debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of
December 2, 2022, the carrying value of our current debt was $500 million, net
of the related discount and issuance costs. We intend to repay the current
portion of our debt on or before the due date.

Contractual Obligations

Our purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services
entered into in the ordinary course of business. As of December 2, 2022, the
value of our non-cancellable unconditional purchase obligations was $6.09
billion, primarily relating to contracts with vendors for third-party hosting
and data center services. See Note 16 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information regarding our purchase obligations.

We lease certain facilities and data centers under non-cancellable operating
lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2032\. As of December
2, 2022, the value of our obligations under operating leases was $548 million.
See Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information regarding our lease obligations.

Other

Our transition tax liability related to historical undistributed foreign
earnings, which was accrued as a result of the U.S. Tax Act, was approximately
$313 million as of December 2, 2022 and is payable in installments through
fiscal 2026. As we repatriate foreign earnings for use in the United States,
the distributions will generally be exempt from federal income taxes. In
addition, the U.S. Tax Act requires companies to capitalize and amortize
research and development expenditures starting fiscal 2023. If not modified,
we anticipate an adverse impact to our effective rates for income taxes paid,
which will be partially offset by the increase in the foreign-derived
intangible income deduction, for fiscal 2023 and beyond.

The Inflation Reduction Act enacted on August 16, 2022 introduced new
provisions including a corporate book minimum tax effective for us beginning
in fiscal 2024 and an excise tax on net stock repurchases made after December
31, 2022. We continue to monitor developments and evaluate impacts, if any, of
these provisions to our results of operations and cash flows.

Stock Repurchase Program

To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our
stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we may repurchase our
shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with
third parties. In December 2020, our Board of Directors granted authority to
repurchase up to $15 billion in our common stock through the end of fiscal
2024.

During fiscal 2022, we repurchased a total of 15.7 million shares, including
approximately 10.4 million shares at an average price of $375.03 through
structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2021 and fiscal
2022, as well as 5.3 million shares at an average purchase price of $451.55
through an accelerated share repurchase agreement entered into during the
first quarter of fiscal 2022.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we entered into a structured stock
repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided
them with a prepayment of $1.75 billion. As of December 2, 2022, $583 million
of prepayment remained under our outstanding structured stock repurchase
agreement.

Subsequent to December 2, 2022, as part of the December 2020 stock repurchase
authority, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a
large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of
$1.4 billion and received an initial delivery of 3.2 million shares, which
represents approximately 75% of our prepayment. Upon completion of the $1.4
billion accelerated share repurchase agreement, $5.15 billion remains under
our December 2020 authority.

See section titled "Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder
Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities" in Part II, Item 5 of this
report for stock repurchases during the quarter ended December 2, 2022 and
Note 14 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details
regarding our stock repurchase program.

Indemnifications

In the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying
scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual
property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our
products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers
under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these
indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to
estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on
our future results of operations.

To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we
indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while
the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The
indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the
officer's or director's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future
payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements
is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that
reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts
paid.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

All market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading
purposes.

Foreign Currency Risk

Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Instruments

In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars
and various other currencies, which subject us to exposure from movements in
exchange rates. We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward
contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated
revenue and expenses. Additionally, we hedge our net recognized foreign
currency monetary assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward
contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be
adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.

Our significant foreign currency revenue exposures for fiscal 2022, 2021 and
2020 were as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
(in millions)| 2022| | 2021| | 2020  
Euro| €| 2,487 | | | €| 2,209 | | | €| 1,887 |  
Japanese Yen| ¥| 118,456 | | | ¥| 104,829 | | | ¥| 88,640 |  
British Pounds| £| 737 | | | £| 669 | | | £| 562 |  
Australian Dollars| $| 876 | | | $| 768 | | | $| 645 |  
  
As of December 2, 2022, the total notional amounts of all outstanding foreign
exchange contracts, including options and forwards, were $3.25 billion, which
included the notional equivalent of $1.32 billion in Euros, $602 million in
Indian Rupees, $480 million in British Pounds, $394 million in Japanese Yen,
$338 million in Australian Dollars and $112 million in other foreign
currencies. As of December 2, 2022, all contracts were set to expire at
various dates through November 2023. The bank counterparties in these
contracts could expose us to credit-related losses that would be largely
mitigated with master netting arrangements with the same counterparty by
permitting net settlement transactions. In addition, we enter into collateral
security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when
the net fair value of these contracts fluctuates from contractually
established thresholds.

A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange
derivatives as of December 2, 2022. This sensitivity analysis measures the
hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange
rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes
option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar
and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset
would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging
instruments by $75 million. A 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar
would lead to an increase in the fair value of these financial instruments by
$17 million.

As a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local
currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge
exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies
substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses. We
also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and
retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar functional currency foreign
subsidiaries. As of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, this long-term
investment exposure totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $770 million
and $749 million, respectively. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term
investment exposures.

We do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor
do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets
the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our
hedging program and assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge
currency exposures on an ongoing basis.

Cash Flow Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Revenue and Expenses

We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge
foreign currency revenue denominated in Euros, British Pounds, Japanese Yen
and Australian Dollars, or foreign currency expenses in Indian Rupees. We
hedge these cash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash
flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These foreign
exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve
months. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted
revenue and expenses in the normal course of business and accordingly, they
are not speculative in nature.

We record changes in fair value of these cash flow hedges of foreign currency
denominated revenue and expenses in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction
occurs. When the forecasted transaction affects earnings, we reclassify the
related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue or

50

Table of Contents

operating expenses, as applicable. In the event the underlying forecasted
transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we
reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) to revenue or operating expenses, as
applicable. For the fiscal year ended December 2, 2022, there were no net
gains or losses recognized in revenue or operating expenses relating to hedges
of forecasted transactions that did not occur.

Non-Designated Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities

Our derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign
currency forward contracts that we primarily use to hedge monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies to reduce the risk that
our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign
currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair
value with changes in fair value of these contracts recorded to other income
(expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. These contracts
reduce the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and
liabilities. At December 2, 2022, the outstanding balance sheet hedging
derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.

See Note 6 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information
regarding our derivative financial instruments.

Interest Rate Risk

Short-Term Investments and Fixed Income Securities

At December 2, 2022, we had debt securities classified as short-term
investments of $1.86 billion. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect
the market value of these investments. A sensitivity analysis was performed on
our short-term investment portfolio as of December 2, 2022, based on an
estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that
would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve. A 150 basis
point increase in interest rates would lead to a $20 million decrease in the
market value of our short-term investments. Conversely, a 150 basis point
decrease in interest rates would lead to a $20 million increase in the market
value of our short-term investments.

Senior Notes

As of December 2, 2022, we had $4.15 billion of senior notes outstanding which
bear interest at fixed rates, and therefore do not subject us to financial
statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. As of December 2,
2022, the total carrying amount of our senior notes was $4.13 billion and the
related fair value based on observable market prices in less active markets
was $3.88 billion.

See Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information
regarding our senior notes.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Operations

Founded in 1982, Adobe is one of the largest and most diversified software
companies in the world. We offer a line of products and services used by
creative professionals, including photographers, video editors, graphic and
experience designers and game developers; communicators, including content
creators, students, marketers and knowledge workers; businesses of all sizes;
and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing,
engaging and transacting with compelling content and experiences across
personal computers, smartphones, other electronic devices and digital media
formats.

We market our products and services directly to enterprise customers through
our sales force and local field offices. We license our products to end users
through app stores and our own website at www.adobe.com. We offer many of our
products via a Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS") model or a managed services
model (both of which are referred to as hosted or cloud-based) as well as
through term subscription and pay-per-use models. We also distribute certain
products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers
("VARs"), systems integrators ("SIs"), independent software vendors ("ISVs"),
retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs").
In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software
developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our
products run on desktop and laptop computers, smartphones, tablets, other
devices and the web, depending on the product. We have operations in the
Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"); and Asia-Pacific ("APAC").

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include those of Adobe and
its subsidiaries, after elimination of all intercompany accounts and
transactions. We have prepared the accompanying Consolidated Financial
Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America ("GAAP") and pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").

Use of Estimates

In preparing Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in
conformity with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we
must make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the
Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. Estimates are used
for, but not limited to, sales allowances and programs, bad debts, stock-based
compensation, determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed
liabilities, litigation and income taxes. Actual results may differ materially
from these estimates.

Fiscal Year

Our fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the Friday closest to
November 30\. Our financial results for fiscal 2021 benefited from an extra
week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial
calendar whereby fiscal 2021 was a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2022 and
2020 which were 52-week years.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts, which are not material, have been reclassified to
conform to current year presentation in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Significant Accounting Policies

Revenue Recognition

Our revenue is derived from the sale of cloud-enabled software subscriptions,
cloud-hosted offerings, term-based, royalty, and perpetual software licenses,
associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services,
training and technical support. Most of our enterprise customer arrangements
involve multiple promises to our customers.

Revenue is recognized when a contract exists between us and a customer and
upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an
amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for
those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various
combinations of products and services, which may be

58

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

ADOBE INC.

  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

  

capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance
obligations, or in the case of offerings such as cloud-enabled Creative Cloud
and Document Cloud, accounted for as a single performance obligation. Revenue
is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from
customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.

Subscription, Product and Services Offerings

We enter into revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a
combination of cloud-enabled subscriptions, cloud-hosted offerings, term-
based, royalty, and perpetual software licenses, associated software
maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and technical
support. Certain revenue arrangements provide customers with unilateral
cancellation rights, or options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based
licenses or use committed funds to purchase other Adobe products or services.

Fully hosted subscription services (SaaS) allow customers to access hosted
software during the contractual term without taking possession of the
software. Cloud-hosted subscription services may be sold on a fee-per-
subscription period basis or based on consumption or usage.

We recognize revenue ratably over the contractual service term for hosted
services that are priced based on a committed number of transactions where the
delivery and consumption of the benefit of the services occur evenly over
time, beginning on the date the services associated with the committed
transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through
the end of the contractual service term. Over-usage fees and fees based on the
actual number of transactions are billed in accordance with contract terms as
these fees are incurred and are included in the transaction price of an
arrangement as variable consideration. Fees based on a number of transactions,
where invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and
consumption, are typically accounted for utilizing the "as-invoiced" practical
expedient. Revenue for subscriptions sold as a fee per period is recognized
ratably over the contractual term as the customer simultaneously receives and
consumes the benefit of the underlying service.

When cloud-enabled services are highly integrated and interrelated with on-
premise software, such as in our cloud-enabled Creative Cloud and Document
Cloud offerings, the individual components are not considered distinct and
revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the
cloud-enabled services are provided.

The subscription support plans related to those customer arrangements whose
revenues we classify as subscription revenues represent stand-ready
performance obligations. Revenue from these subscription support plans is
recognized ratably over their respective contractual terms and classified as
subscription revenue.

Licenses for on-premise software may be purchased on a perpetual basis, as a
subscription for a fixed period of time or based on usage for certain of our
OEM and royalty agreements. Revenue from non-cloud enabled on-premise licenses
without unilateral cancellation rights or monthly renewal options is
recognized at the point in time the software is available to the customer,
provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met, and classified as
product revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income. Revenue from on-
premise term license or term licensing arrangements with unilateral
cancellation rights or monthly renewal options, and any associated maintenance
and support, is classified as subscription revenue.

Our services and other revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to
consulting, training, maintenance and support for certain on-premise licenses
that are recognized at a point in time and our advertising offerings. We
typically sell our consulting contracts on a time-and-materials or fixed-fee
basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are performed for time-
and-materials contracts and on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee
contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Our
maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers, partners and
developers to receive desktop product upgrades and enhancements or technical
support, depending on the offering, are generally recognized ratably over the
term of the arrangement. Our transaction-based advertising offerings, where
fees are based on a number of impressions per month and invoicing is aligned
to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically
accounted for utilizing the "as-invoiced" practical expedient.

Judgments

Our contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For
example, some of our offerings include both on-premise and/or on-device
software licenses and cloud services. Determining whether the software
licenses and the cloud services are distinct from each other, and therefore
performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from

59

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

ADOBE INC.

  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

  

each other, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may require
significant judgment. We have concluded that the on-premise/on-device software
licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud
subscription offerings are not distinct from each other such that revenue from
each offering should be recognized ratably over the subscription period for
which the cloud services are provided. In reaching this conclusion, we
considered the nature of our promise to Creative Cloud and Document Cloud
customers, which is to provide a complete end-to-end creative design or
document workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple devices
and teams. We fulfill this promise by providing access to a solution that
integrates cloud-based and on-premise/on-device features that, together
through their integration, provide functionalities, utility and workflow
efficiencies that could not be obtained from either the on-premise/on-device
software or cloud services on their own.

Cloud-based features that are integral to our Creative Cloud and Document
Cloud offerings and that work together with the on-premise/on-device software
include, but are not limited to: Creative Cloud Libraries, which enable
customers to access their work, settings, preferences and other assets
seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices and collaborate across teams in
real time; shared reviews which enable simultaneous editing and commenting of
digital assets across desktop, mobile and web; automatic cloud rendering of a
design which enables it to be worked on in multiple mediums; and Sensei,
Adobe's cloud-hosted artificial intelligence and machine learning framework,
which enables features such as automated photo-editing, photograph content-
awareness, natural language processing, optical character recognition and
automated document tagging.

Standalone selling price is established by maximizing the amount of observable
inputs, primarily actual historical selling prices for performance obligations
where available, and includes consideration of factors such as go-to-market
model and geography. Individual products may have multiple values for
standalone selling price depending on factors such as where they are sold and
what channel they are sold through. Where standalone selling price may not be
directly observable (e.g., the performance obligation is not sold separately),
we maximize the use of observable inputs by using information that may include
reviewing pricing practices, performance obligations with similar customers
and selling models.

Capitalized costs to obtain a contract are amortized over the expected period
of benefit, which we have determined, based on analysis, to be 5 years. We
evaluated qualitative and quantitative factors to determine the period of
amortization, including contract length, renewals, customer life and the
useful lives of our products and acquired products. When the expected period
of benefit of an asset which would be capitalized is less than one year, we
expense the amount as incurred, utilizing the practical expedient. We
regularly evaluate whether there have been changes in the underlying
assumptions and data used to determine the amortization period.

When revenue arrangements include components of third-party goods and
services, for example in transactions which involve resale, fulfillment or
providing advertising impressions to our end customer, we evaluate whether we
are the principal, and report revenues on a gross basis, or an agent, and
report revenues on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain
control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the
customer by evaluating indicators such as which party is primarily responsible
for fulfilling the promise to provide the goods or services, which party has
discretion in establishing price and the underlying terms and conditions
between the parties to the transaction.

We offer limited rights of return, rebates and price protection of our
products under various policies and programs with our distributors, resellers
and/or end-user customers. We estimate and record reserves for these programs
as variable consideration when estimating transaction price. Returns, rebates
and other offsets to transaction price are estimated at contract inception on
a portfolio basis and assessed for reasonableness each reporting period when
additional information becomes available.

General Contract Provisions

We maintain revenue reserves for rebates, rights of return and other limited
price adjustments. Distributors are allowed limited rights of return of
products purchased during the previous quarter. In addition, distributors are
allowed to return products that have reached the end of their lives, as
defined by us, and for products that are being replaced by new versions. We
offer rebates to our distributors, resellers and/or end-user customers.
Transaction price is reduced for these amounts based on actual performance
against objectives set forth by us for a particular reporting period, such as
volume and timely reporting.

On a quarterly basis, the amount of revenue that is reserved is calculated
based on our historical trends and data specific to each reporting period. The
primary method of establishing these reserves is to review historical data
from prior periods as a

60

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

ADOBE INC.

  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

  

percent of revenue to determine a historical reserve rate. We then apply the
historical rate to the current period revenue as a basis for estimating future
returns. When necessary, we also provide a specific reserve in excess of
portfolio-level estimated requirements. This estimate can be affected by the
amount of a particular product in the channel, the rate of sell-through,
product plans and other factors.

Although our subscription contracts are generally non-cancellable, a limited
number of customers have the right to cancel their contracts by providing
prior written notice to us of their intent to cancel the remainder of the
contract term and consumers have a period of time to terminate certain
agreements without penalty. In the event a customer cancels their contract,
they are generally not entitled to a refund for prior services we have
provided to them. Contracts that include termination rights without
substantive penalty are accounted for as contracts only for the committed
period. Periods of time after the right of termination are accounted for as
optional purchases when they do not represent material rights. For certain of
our usage-based license agreements, typically in our royalty and OEM
businesses, reporting may be received after the end of a fiscal period. In
such instances, we estimate and accrue license revenue. We base our estimates
on multiple factors, including historical sales information, seasonality and
other business information which may impact our estimates. We do not estimate
variable consideration for our sales and usage-based license royalty
agreements, consistent with the associated exception for sales and usage-based
royalties for the license of intellectual property under the revenue
recognition standard.

Property and Equipment

We record property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Property and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line
method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 20 years for
computers and other equipment, which includes our corporate jet, 2 to 5 years
for furniture and fixtures, 5 to 25 years for building improvements and up to
40 years for buildings. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the
straight-line method over the lesser of the remaining respective lease term or
estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 15 years.

Leases

We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception.
In certain of our lease arrangements, primarily those related to our data
center arrangements, judgment is required in determining if a contract
contains a lease. For these arrangements, there is judgment in evaluating if
the arrangement involves an identified asset that is physically distinct or
whether we have the right to substantially all of the capacity of an
identified asset that is not physically distinct. In arrangements that involve
an identified asset, there is also judgment in evaluating if we have the right
to direct the use of that asset.

We do not have any finance leases. Operating leases are recorded in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Right-of-use ("ROU") assets and lease liabilities
are measured at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the
remaining lease payments over the lease term, determined using the discount
rate for the lease at the commencement date. Because the rate implicit in our
leases is not readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate as
the discount rate, which approximates the interest rate at which we could
borrow on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments and in
similar economic environments. As of December 2, 2022, our leases had
remaining lease terms of up to 9 years, some of which included options to
extend the lease for up to 14 years and options to terminate the lease within
1 year. Optional periods to extend the lease, including by not exercising a
termination option, are included in the lease term when it is reasonably
certain that the option will be exercised. We also have one land lease that
expires in 2091\. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. We account for lease and non-lease components,
principally common area maintenance for our facilities leases, as a single
lease component for our facilities and data center leases.

In accordance with accounting requirements, leases with an initial term of 12
months or less are recorded on the balance sheet, with lease expense for these
leases recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Goodwill, Intangibles and Other Long-Lived Assets

Goodwill is assigned to one or more reporting units on the date of
acquisition. We review our goodwill for impairment annually during our second
quarter of each fiscal year and between annual tests if an event occurs or
circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of
any one of our reporting units below its respective carrying amount. In
performing our goodwill impairment test, we first perform a qualitative
assessment, which requires that we consider events or

61

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

ADOBE INC.

  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

  

circumstances including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market
considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in
management or key personnel, changes in strategy, changes in customers,
changes in the composition or carrying amount of a reporting unit's net assets
and changes in our stock price. If, after assessing the totality of events or
circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair
values of our reporting units are greater than the carrying amounts, then the
quantitative goodwill impairment test is not performed.

If the qualitative assessment indicates that the quantitative analysis should
be performed, we then evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair
value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value, including the
associated goodwill. To determine the fair values, we use the equal weighting
of the market approach based on comparable publicly traded companies in
similar lines of businesses and the income approach based on estimated
discounted future cash flows. Our cash flow assumptions consider historical
and forecasted revenue, operating costs and other relevant factors.

We completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of
fiscal 2022. We determined, after performing a qualitative review of each
reporting unit, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of
our reporting units substantially exceeds the respective carrying amounts.
Accordingly, there was no indication of impairment and the quantitative
goodwill impairment test was not performed. We did not identify any events or
changes in circumstances since the performance of our annual goodwill
impairment test that would require us to perform another goodwill impairment
test during the fiscal year.

We amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful
lives and review them for impairment whenever an impairment indicator exists.
We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate
that the carrying amounts of our long-lived assets, including our intangible
assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances
occur, we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of
such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash
flows. If the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount
of these assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on any excess of the
carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. We did not recognize any
intangible asset impairment charges for all periods presented.

Our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging
from 2 to 14 years. Amortization is based on the pattern in which the economic
benefits of the intangible asset will be consumed or on a straight-line basis
when the consumption pattern is not apparent. The weighted average useful
lives of our intangible assets were as follows:

| | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
|

Weighted Average

Useful Life (years)  
  
Customer contracts and relationships| 10  
Purchased technology| 5  
Trademarks| 9  
|  
|  
Other | 4  
  
Income Taxes

We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under
this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable
or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of
temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets
and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
Significant judgment is required in determining our current provision for
income taxes and deferred tax assets or liabilities. We record a valuation
allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount for which realization is
more likely than not.

Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for
income taxes take into account our interpretation and application of current
tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future examinations conducted by
domestic and foreign tax authorities. We have established reserves for income
taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be
challenged by tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes
resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision
for income taxes and associated reserves. Our policy is to record interest and
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

Taxes Collected from Customers

We net taxes collected from customers against those remitted to government
authorities in our financial statements. Accordingly, taxes collected from
customers are not reported as revenue.

Treasury Stock

Prepayments made for repurchases of our common stock are classified as
treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and only shares physically
delivered to us at period ends are excluded from the computation of earnings
per share.

We account for treasury stock under the cost method. When treasury stock is
re-issued at a price higher than its cost, the difference is recorded as a
component of additional paid-in-capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
When treasury stock is re-issued at a price lower than its cost, the
difference is recorded as a component of additional paid-in-capital to the
extent that there are previously recorded gains to offset the losses. If there
are no treasury stock gains in additional paid-in-capital, the losses upon re-
issuance of treasury stock are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in
our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Advertising Expenses

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses for fiscal
2022, 2021 and 2020 were $1.04 billion, $865 million and $592 million,
respectively. Prior year amounts have been recast to conform to current year
presentation, which reflect changes to modernize the categorization of costs
reported as advertising expenses, primarily associated with the inclusion of
certain digital advertising costs. There was no impact to the Consolidated
Statements of Income resulting from this change.

Foreign Currency Translation

We translate assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, whose functional
currency is their local currency, at exchange rates in effect at the balance
sheet date. We translate revenue and expenses at the monthly average exchange
rates. We include accumulated net translation adjustments in stockholders'
equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Derivative Financial Instruments

In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars
and in various other currencies. We may use foreign exchange option contracts
or forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency
denominated revenue and expenses primarily in Euros, British Pounds, Japanese
Yen, Australian Dollars and Indian Rupees. Additionally, we hedge our net
recognized foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities with foreign
exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows
will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.

We recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses
resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of
the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge
accounting. Contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are adjusted to
fair value through earnings.

Gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of foreign exchange
forward contracts which hedge certain balance sheet positions are recorded
each period as a component of other income (expense), net in our Consolidated
Statements of Income. Foreign exchange option contracts and forward contracts
hedging forecasted foreign currency revenue and expenses and Treasury lock
agreements are designated as cash flow hedges with gains and losses recorded
net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
our Consolidated Balance Sheets until the forecasted transaction occurs. When
the forecasted transaction affects earnings, we reclassify the related gain or
loss on the foreign currency revenue, foreign currency expense or Treasury
lock cash flow hedge to revenue, operating expense or interest expense, as
applicable.

Concentration of Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit
risk are short-term fixed-income investments, structured repurchase
transactions, foreign currency and interest rate hedge contracts and trade
receivables.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

  

Our investment portfolio consists of investment-grade securities diversified
among security types, industries and issuers. Our cash and investments are
held and primarily managed by recognized financial institutions that follow
our investment policy. Our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any
one security issue or issuer and we believe no significant concentration of
credit risk exists with respect to these investments.

We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in
derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the
same counterparty. We also enter into collateral security agreements with
certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair
value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates from contractually
established thresholds.

Credit risk in receivables is limited to OEMs, dealers and distributors of
hardware and software products to the retail market, customers to whom we
license software directly and our SaaS offerings. A credit review is completed
for our new distributors, dealers and OEMs. We also perform ongoing credit
evaluations of our customers' financial condition and require letters of
credit or other guarantees, whenever deemed necessary. The credit limit given
to the customer is based on our risk assessment of their ability to pay,
country risk and other factors and is not contingent on the resale of the
product or on the collection of payments from their customers. Certain
contracts with advertising agencies contain sequential liability provisions,
under which the agency is not required to pay until payment is received from
the agency's customers. In these circumstances, we evaluate the credit-
worthiness of the agency's customers in addition to the agency itself. If we
license our software or provide SaaS services to a customer where we have a
reason to believe the customer's ability and intention to pay is not probable,
the arrangement is not considered to be a revenue contract. Accordingly, we
will not recognize any consideration received as revenue until termination or
substantive completion of the services.

Adopted Accounting Guidance and Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective

There have been no recent accounting pronouncements, changes in accounting
pronouncements or recently adopted accounting guidance during fiscal 2022 that
are of significance or potential significance to us.

NOTE 2. REVENUE

Segment Information

We report segment information based on the "management" approach. The
management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for
making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable
segments.

Our Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, reviews
revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but
does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition,
with the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate our assets by
the reportable segments.

Our business is organized into the following reportable segments:

•Digital Media--Our Digital Media segment provides products, services and
solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish
and promote their content anywhere and accelerate their productivity by
modernizing how they view, share, engage with and collaborate on documents and
creative content. Our customers include creative professionals, including
photographers, video editors, graphic and experience designers and game
developers, communicators, including content creators, students, marketers and
knowledge workers, and consumers.

•Digital Experience--Our Digital Experience segment provides an integrated
platform and set of applications and services that enable brands and
businesses to create, manage, execute, measure, monetize and optimize customer
experiences that span from analytics to commerce. Our customers include
marketers, advertisers, agencies, publishers, merchandisers, merchants, web
analysts, data scientists, developers and executives across the C-suite.

•Publishing and Advertising--Our Publishing and Advertising segment contains
legacy products and services that address diverse market opportunities,
including eLearning solutions, technical document publishing, web
conferencing, document and forms platform, web application development, high-
end printing and our Adobe Advertising Cloud offerings.

Contract Balances

Trade Receivables

A receivable is recorded when an unconditional right to invoice and receive
payment exists, such that only the passage of time is required before payment
of consideration is due. Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the
timing of invoicing to customers. Certain performance obligations may require
payment before delivery of the license or service to the customer. Included in
trade receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are unbilled receivable
balances which have not yet been invoiced, and are typically related to
license revenue or services which are delivered prior to invoicing. As of
December 2, 2022, the balance of trade receivables, net of allowances for
doubtful accounts, was $2.07 billion, inclusive of unbilled receivables of $93
million. As of December 3, 2021, the balance of trade receivables, net of
allowance for doubtful accounts, was $1.88 billion, inclusive of unbilled
receivables of $82 million.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which reflects our best
estimate of potentially uncollectible trade receivables and is based on both
specific and general reserves. We maintain general reserves on a collective
basis by considering factors such as historical experience, credit-worthiness,
the age of the trade receivable balances, current economic conditions and a
reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic conditions. The
allowance for doubtful accounts was $23 million and $16 million as of December
2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, respectively.

Contract Assets

A contract asset is recognized when a conditional right to consideration
exists and transfer of control has occurred. Contract assets are typically
related to subscription and hosted service contracts where the transaction
price allocated to the satisfied performance obligations exceeds the value of
billings to date. Contract assets are included in prepaid expenses and other
current assets for the current portion and other assets for the long-term
portion on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We regularly review contract asset
balances for impairment, considering factors such as historical experience,
credit-worthiness, age of the balance, current economic conditions and a
reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic conditions. Contract
asset impairments were not material in fiscal 2022 and 2021. Contract assets
were $97 million and $85 million as of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021,
respectively.

Deferred Revenue and Remaining Performance Obligations

Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in
advance of revenue recognition from subscription services, including non-
cancellable and non-refundable committed funds and refundable customer
deposits. Deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when transfer of control
to customers has occurred. Customers are typically invoiced for these
agreements in regular installments and revenue is recognized ratably over the
contractual subscription period. The deferred revenue balance is influenced by
several factors, including the compounding effects of renewals, invoice
duration, invoice timing, size and new business linearity within the quarter.
Deferred revenue does not represent the total contract value of annual or
multi-year non-cancellable subscription agreements.

Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally
include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the
timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have
determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing
component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers
with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services,
such as invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue
recognized ratably over the contract period, and not to receive financing from
our customers. Any potential financing fees are considered insignificant in
the context of our contracts.

As of December 2, 2022, the balance of deferred revenue was $5.41 billion,
which includes $99 million of refundable customer deposits. Refundable
customer deposits represent arrangements in which the customer has a
unilateral cancellation right for which we are obligated to refund amounts
paid related to products or services not yet delivered or provided at the time
of cancellation on a prorated basis. Arrangements with some of our enterprise
customers with non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds provide
options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use some or
all funds to purchase other Adobe products or services. Non-cancellable and
non-refundable committed funds related to these agreements comprised
approximately 5% of the total deferred revenue.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

  

As of December 3, 2021, the balance of deferred revenue was $4.88 billion.
Significant movements in the deferred revenue balance during the period
consisted of increases due to payments received prior to transfer of control
of the underlying performance obligations to the customer and deferred revenue
assumed through acquisition, which were offset by decreases due to revenue
recognized in the period. During the year ended December 2, 2022,
approximately $4.72 billion of revenue was recognized that was included in the
balance of deferred revenue as of December 3, 2021.

Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents
contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred
revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future
periods. Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is
influenced by several factors, including the timing of renewals and average
contract term. We applied practical expedients to exclude amounts related to
performance obligations that are billed and recognized as they are delivered,
optional purchases that do not represent material rights, sales- and usage-
based royalties not yet consumed and any estimated amounts of variable
consideration that are subject to constraint.

Remaining performance obligations were approximately $15.19 billion as of
December 2, 2022. Non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds related
to some of our enterprise customer agreements referred to in the paragraph
above comprised approximately 5% of the total remaining performance
obligations. Approximately 72% of the remaining performance obligations,
excluding the aforementioned enterprise customer agreements, are expected to
be recognized over the next 12 months with the remainder recognized
thereafter.

Contract Acquisition Costs

We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a
customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year.
We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements
to be capitalized.

The costs capitalized are primarily sales commissions paid to our sales force
personnel. Capitalized costs may also include portions of fringe benefits and
payroll taxes associated with compensation for incremental costs to acquire
customer contracts and incentive payments to partners.

Capitalized costs to obtain a contract are amortized over the expected period
of benefit, which we have determined, based on analysis, to be 5 years.
Amortization of capitalized costs are included in sales and marketing expense
in our Consolidated Statements of Income. During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020,
we amortized $238 million, $212 million and $186 million of capitalized
contract acquisition costs into sales and marketing expense, respectively. We
did not incur any impairment losses for all periods presented.

Capitalized contract acquisition costs were $629 million and $611 million as
of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, of which $406 million was long-term
and included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for both
periods presented. The remaining balance of the capitalized costs to obtain
contracts was current and included in prepaid expenses and other current
assets.

Refund Liabilities

We record refund liabilities for amounts that may be subject to future
refunds, which include sales returns reserves and customer rebates and
credits. Refund liabilities are included in accrued expenses on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refund liabilities were $106 million and $128
million as of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, respectively.

Significant Customers

For all periods presented, there were no customers that represented at least
10% of net revenue or that were responsible for over 10% of our trade
receivables.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS

Figma

On September 15, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we
intend to acquire Figma, Inc. ("Figma") for approximately $20 billion,
comprised of approximately half cash and half stock, subject to customary
purchase price adjustments. Approximately 6 million additional restricted
stock units will be granted to Figma's Chief Executive Officer and employees
that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is
subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and is
expected to close in 2023. We will be required to pay Figma a reverse
termination fee of $1 billion if the transaction fails to receive regulatory
clearance, assuming all other closing conditions have been satisfied or
waived, or if it fails to close within 18 months from September 15, 2022.

Figma is a privately held company that provides a web-first collaborative
product design platform. Following the closing, we intend to integrate Figma
into our Digital Media reportable segment for financial reporting purposes.

Frame.io

On October 7, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held
company that provides a cloud-based video collaboration platform, for
approximately $1.24 billion, primarily in cash consideration. The financial
results of Frame.io have been included in our Consolidated Financial
Statements since the date of the acquisition. Frame.io is reported as part of
our Digital Media reportable segment.

NOTE 4. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid marketable securities with remaining
maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. We classify our
investments in marketable debt securities as "available-for-sale." We carry
these investments at fair value, based on quoted market prices or other
readily available market information. Unrealized gains and unrealized non-
credit-related losses of marketable debt securities are included in
accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes, in our Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Unrealized credit-related losses are recorded to other income
(expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income with a corresponding
allowance for credit-related losses in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains
and losses are determined using the specific identification method and
recognized when realized in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of short-term fixed
income debt securities classified as short-term investments based on stated
effective maturities as of December 2, 2022:

---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

Due between two and three years| | | 248 |  
Due after three years| | | 9 |  
Total| | | $| 1,860 |  
  
We review our debt securities classified as short-term investments on a
regular basis for impairment. For debt securities in unrealized loss
positions, we determine whether any portion of the decline in fair value below
the amortized cost basis is due to credit-related factors if we neither intend
to sell nor anticipate that it is more likely than not that we will be
required to sell prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. We consider
factors such as the extent to which the market value has been less than the
cost, any noted failure of the issuer to make scheduled payments, changes to
the rating of the security and other relevant credit-related factors in
determining whether or not a credit loss exists. During fiscal 2022 and 2021,
we did not recognize an allowance for credit-related losses on any of our
investments.

See Note 4 for further information regarding the fair value of our financial
instruments.

Our fixed income available-for-sale debt securities consist of high quality,
investment grade securities from diverse issuers with a weighted average
credit rating of AA-. We value these securities based on pricing from
independent pricing vendors who use matrix pricing valuation techniques
including market approach methodologies that model information generated by
market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, as well as
discounted cash flow methodologies. Inputs include quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or inputs other than quoted prices that are
observable either directly or indirectly in determining fair value, including
benchmark yields, issuer spreads off benchmark yields, interest rates and U.S.
Treasury or swap curves. We therefore categorize all of our fixed income
available-for-sale securities as Level 2. We perform routine procedures such
as comparing prices obtained from multiple independent sources to ensure that
appropriate fair values are recorded.

The fair values of our money market funds, time deposits and deferred
compensation plan assets, which consist of money market and other mutual
funds, are based on quoted prices in active markets at the measurement date.

Our over-the-counter foreign currency derivatives are valued using pricing
models and discounted cash flow methodologies based on observable foreign
exchange and interest rate data at the measurement date.

Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair
values that approximate their carrying values.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

The fair value of our senior notes was $3.88 billion as of December 2, 2022,
based on observable market prices in less active markets and categorized as
Level 2. See Note 17 for further details regarding our debt.

NOTE 6. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

We may use derivatives to partially offset our business exposure to foreign
currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, and certain
existing assets and liabilities. We do not use any of our derivative
instruments for trading purposes.

We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in
derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the
same counterparty. We do not offset fair value amounts recognized for
derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. We also enter into
collateral security agreements with certain of our counterparties to exchange
cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments
fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. Collateral posted is
included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and collateral received
is included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Cash Flow Hedges

In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars
and in various other currencies. We may use foreign exchange option contracts
or forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency
denominated revenue and expenses. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at
fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. As of December 2, 2022 and
December 3, 2021, total notional amounts of outstanding cash flow hedges were
$2.43 billion and $2.06 billion, respectively, hedging exposures denominated
in Euros, Indian Rupees, British Pounds, Japanese Yen and Australian Dollars.

In June 2019, we entered into Treasury lock agreements with large financial
institutions which fixed benchmark U.S. Treasury rates for an aggregate
notional amount of $1 billion of our future debt issuance. These derivative
instruments hedged the impact of changes in the benchmark interest rate to
future interest payments and were settled upon debt issuance in the first
quarter of fiscal 2020. We incurred a loss related to the settlement of the
instruments which is amortized to interest expense over the term of our debt
due February 1, 2030. See Note 17 for further details regarding our debt.

As of December 2, 2022, we had net derivative gains on our foreign exchange
option contracts expected to be recognized within the next 18 months, of which
$53 million of gains are expected to be recognized into revenue within the
next 12 months. In addition, we had net derivative losses on our foreign
exchange forward contracts, of which $7 million of losses are expected to be
recognized into operating expenses within the next 12 months, and net
derivative losses on our Treasury lock agreements, of which $5 million is
expected to be recognized into interest expense within the next 12 months.

To receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally
documented at the inception of the hedge, and the hedges must be highly
effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions.
We record changes in fair value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the
forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction affects
earnings, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the foreign currency
revenue, foreign currency expense or Treasury lock cash flow hedge to revenue,
operating expense or interest expense, as applicable. In the event the
underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that
it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow
hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to the same income
statement line item as the hedged item. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the
inception of the hedge prospectively, and on an ongoing basis both
retrospectively and prospectively. If we do not elect hedge accounting, or the
contract does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in fair
value from period to period are recorded in the same income statement line
item as the hedged item.

For fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were no net gains or losses recognized
in income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.

Non-Designated Hedges

Our derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign
currency forward contracts that we primarily use to hedge monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. The changes in fair
value of these contracts are recorded to other income (expense), net in our
Consolidated Statements of Income. Changes in the fair value of the underlying
assets and liabilities associated with the hedged risk are generally offset by
the changes in the fair value of the related contracts.

Intra-Entity Transfers of Certain Intellectual Property Rights ("IP rights")

During fiscal 2020, we completed intra-entity transfers of certain IP rights
to our Irish subsidiary in order to better align the ownership of these rights
with how our business operates. The transfers did not result in taxable gains;
however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and
tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these
transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and
related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP
rights transferred. The determination of the fair value involves significant
judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The
tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized
over the period of economic benefit.

Reconciliation of Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes

Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities

The tax effects of the temporary differences that gave rise to significant
portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 2, 2022 and
December 3, 2021 were as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
(in millions)| | 2022| | 2021  
Deferred tax assets:| |  | |

Capitalized expenses| | 298 | | | 355 |

Total gross deferred tax assets| | 1,779 | | | 2,145 |  
Valuation allowance| | (402)| | | (335)|  
Total deferred tax assets| | 1,377 | | | 1,810 |  
Deferred tax liabilities:| | | |  
Acquired intangible assets| | 354 | | | 447 |  
Operating lease right-of-use assets| | 97 | | | 111 |

| | | |  
Total deferred tax liabilities| | 628 | | | 730 |  
Net deferred tax assets| | $| 749 | | | $| 1,080 |  
  
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax
consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax
bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards.

As of December 2, 2022, we had federal and state net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $202 million and $467 million, respectively. We
also had federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $39
million and $362 million, respectively. The majority of the federal net
operating loss and state tax credit carryforwards can be carried forward
indefinitely, and the remaining will expire in various years from fiscal 2023
through 2040. Certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are
subject to an annual limitation and/or are reduced by a valuation allowance.
The net carrying amount of such assets is expected to be fully realized.

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management determined
that it is more likely than not that we will not fully realize certain
available tax attributes and other tax assets in domestic and foreign
jurisdictions. Deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance to the
extent it is more likely than not that they are not expected to be realized.
As of December 2, 2022, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of $402
million primarily related to certain state credits. For fiscal 2022, the
increase in the valuation allowance was $67 million.

As we repatriate foreign earnings for use in the United States, the
distributions will generally be exempt from federal income taxes. As of
December 2, 2022, the cumulative amount of foreign earnings considered
permanently reinvested upon which taxes have not been provided, and the
corresponding unrecognized deferred tax liability, was not material.

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

During fiscal 2022 and 2021, the aggregate changes in our total gross amount
of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
(in millions)| | 2022| | 2021  
Beginning balance| | $| 289 | | | $| 201 |

Tax settlements| | (18)| | | (4)|  
Foreign exchange gains and losses| | (1)| | | (3)|  
Ending balance| | $| 321 | | | $| 289 |  
  
Our policy is to record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax
positions within the provision for (benefit from) income taxes. The combined
amount of accrued interest and penalties included in long-term income taxes
payable related to tax positions taken on our tax returns were approximately
$17 million and $22 million for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.

While we file federal, state and local income tax returns globally, our major
tax jurisdictions are Ireland, California and the United States. We are
subject to the examination of our income tax returns by various domestic and
foreign tax authorities with 2018 being the earliest fiscal year open for
examination in all of our major tax jurisdictions. We regularly assess the
likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the
adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential
adjustments that may result from these examinations. We believe our tax
estimates to be reasonable; however, we cannot provide assurance that the
final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse
effect on our financial position and results of operations.

The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as
are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit
settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance
sheet classification of our tax assets and liabilities. We believe that within
the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will
conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods
will expire, or both. Although the timing of resolution, settlement and
closing of audits is not certain, it is reasonably possible that the
underlying unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $25 million over
the next 12 months.

NOTE 11. BENEFIT PLANS

Retirement Savings Plan

The Adobe Inc. 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan, qualified under Section 401(k)
of the Internal Revenue Code, is a retirement savings plan covering
substantially all of our U.S. employees. Under the plan, eligible employees
may contribute up to 65% of their pretax or after-tax salary, subject to the
IRS annual contribution limits. In fiscal 2022, we matched 50% of the first 6%
of the employee's eligible compensation. We contributed $76 million, $64
million and $59 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We are
under no obligation to continue matching future employee contributions and, at
our discretion, may change our practices at any time.

Deferred Compensation Plan

The Adobe Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded, non-qualified,
deferred compensation arrangement under which certain executives are able to
defer a portion of their annual compensation. Participants may elect to
contribute up to 75% of their base salary and 100% of other specified
compensation, including commissions, bonuses and directors' fees. Participants
are able to elect the payment of benefits to begin on a specified date at
least three years after the end of the plan year in which election is made or,
with respect to equity awards, vests. Members of the Board of Directors are
also eligible to participate and are able to defer cash compensation and elect
cash benefit distributions in the same manner as executives. Beginning January
1, 2020, only members of the Board are permitted to defer equity awards. For
cash benefit elections, distributions are made in

79

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

ADOBE INC.

  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

  

cash in the form of a lump sum, or five, ten, or fifteen-year annual
installments. For equity award elections, distributions are made in stock in
the form of a lump sum payment only.

Certain deferred compensation is invested in money market and other mutual
funds and subsequently recorded as other assets on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets, with corresponding unrealized holding gains and losses recorded as
investment gains (losses) in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
Undistributed deferred compensation is recorded as long-term liabilities on
our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, the invested amounts under the
plan totaled $160 million and $151 million, respectively. As of December 2,
2022 and December 3, 2021, undistributed deferred compensation due to
participants totaled $178 million and $174 million, respectively.

NOTE 12. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Our stock-based compensation programs are long-term retention programs that
are intended to attract, retain and provide incentives for employees, officers
and directors, and to align stockholder and employee interests. We have the
following stock-based compensation plans and programs:

Restricted Stock Units and Performance Share Programs

We grant restricted stock units and performance share awards to eligible
employees under our 2019 Equity Incentive Plan ("2019 Plan"). Restricted stock
units generally vest over four years. Certain grants have other vesting
periods approved by the Executive Compensation Committee of our Board of
Directors (the "ECC").

As of December 2, 2022, we had reserved 52.0 million shares of our common
stock for issuance under our 2019 Plan and had 30.5 million shares available
for grant.

Our Performance Share Programs aim to help focus key employees on building
stockholder value, provide significant award potential for achieving
outstanding company performance and enhance our ability to attract and retain
highly talented and competent individuals. The ECC approves the terms of each
of our Performance Share Programs, including the award calculation
methodology.

In January 2022, the ECC approved the 2022 Performance Share Program. Shares
outstanding under our 2022 Performance Share Program may be earned based on
the achievement of (i) an objective relative total stockholder return measured
over a three-year performance period, as well as (ii) revenue-based financial
metrics measured over three one-year performance periods. Each type of
performance goal is weighted 50% and achievement of each performance goal is
determined independently of the other. Shares associated with each performance
goal are not awarded until the corresponding performance targets are defined.

Shares outstanding under our 2021 and 2020 Performance Share Programs may be
earned based on the achievement of an objective relative total stockholder
return measured over a three-year performance period.

Performance share awards in each of our 2022, 2021 and 2020 Performance Share
Programs will be earned and cliff-vest upon the later of (i) the three-year
anniversary of the earliest vesting commencement date in the respective
Performance Share Program, or (ii) the ECC's certification of the level of
achievement of the final performance period in the respective Performance
Share Program, contingent upon the participant's continued service.
Participants can earn between 0% and 200% of the target number of performance
shares.

As of December 2, 2022, the shares awarded under our 2022, 2021 and 2020
Performance Share Programs remained outstanding and were yet to be earned.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Our Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") allows eligible employee
participants to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount through
payroll deductions. The ESPP consists of twenty-four-month offering periods
with four six-month purchase periods in each offering period. Employees
purchase shares in each purchase period at 85% of the market value of our

80

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

ADOBE INC.

  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

  

common stock at either the beginning of the offering period or the end of the
purchase period, whichever price is lower. If the market value of our common
stock at the end of a purchase period is lower than the market value at the
beginning of the offering period, participants are rolled over into the
subsequent offering, resulting in a reset of the offering price and the
twenty-four month offering period.

The ESPP will continue until the earlier of termination by the Board of
Directors or the date on which all of the shares available for issuance under
the plan have been issued.

As of December 2, 2022, we had reserved 103.0 million shares of our common
stock for issuance under the ESPP and approximately 10.7 million shares remain
available for future issuance.

Issuance of Shares

Upon vesting of restricted stock units and performance shares or purchase of
shares under the ESPP, we will issue treasury stock. If treasury stock is not
available, common stock will be issued. In order to minimize the impact of on-
going dilution from issuance of shares, we instituted a stock repurchase
program. See Note 14 for information regarding our stock repurchase programs.

Valuation of Stock-Based Compensation

Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair
value of the award.

Our restricted stock units are valued based on the fair market value of the
award on the grant date. Our performance share awards which are contingent
upon achievement of relative total stockholder return are valued using a Monte
Carlo Simulation model. Our performance share awards which are contingent upon
achievement of revenue-based financial metrics are valued based on the fair
market value of the award on the grant date.

We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of
ESPP purchase rights. The determination of the grant date fair value of our
ESPP purchase rights is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions
regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables
include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the
awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, a risk-
free interest rate and any expected dividends.

Summary of Restricted Stock Units

Restricted stock unit activity for fiscal 2022 was as follows:

(1) The aggregate fair value is calculated using the closing stock price as of
December 2, 2022 of $341.53.

Shares awarded during fiscal 2022 include 0.2 million additional shares
awarded for the final achievement of the 2019 Performance Share Program which
was certified in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The remaining awarded
shares were for the 2022 Performance Share Program. Shares released during
fiscal 2022 resulted from 168% achievement of target for the 2019 Performance
Share Program.

The weighted average grant date fair values of performance share awards
granted during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $402.24, $325.24 and $271.62,
respectively. The total fair value of performance share awards vested during
fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $192 million, $212 million and $273 million,
respectively.

Summary of Employee Stock Purchase Plan Shares

Employees purchased 0.8 million shares at an average price of $333.92, 1.0
million shares at an average price of $294.15, and 1.2 million shares at an
average price of $218.37 for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The
intrinsic value of shares purchased during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $73
million, $256 million and $216 million, respectively. The intrinsic value is
calculated as the difference between the market value on the date of purchase
and the purchase price of the shares.

During fiscal 2022, the rollover provision of our ESPP was triggered and
resulted in incremental expense to be recognized over the new twenty-four-
month offering period, which did not have a material impact on our
Consolidated Statements of Income.

Compensation Costs

We recognize the estimated compensation costs of restricted stock units, net
of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
period of the entire award, which is generally the vesting period. The
estimated compensation cost is based on the fair value of our common stock on
the date of grant.

Compensation costs for our performance share awards which are contingent upon
achievement of relative total stockholder return are recognized, net of
estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite performance
period or service period of the entire award, whichever is longer.
Compensation costs for our performance share awards which are contingent upon
achievement of revenue-based financial metrics are recognized, net of
estimated forfeitures, based upon the expected levels of achievement, which
are assessed periodically until certification by the ECC.

We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in
subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use
historical data to estimate forfeitures and record stock-based compensation
expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.

As of December 2, 2022, there was $2.83 billion of unrecognized compensation
cost, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, related to non-vested stock-based
awards and purchase rights which will be recognized over a weighted average
period of 2.29 years. Total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted
for future changes in estimated forfeitures.

Total stock-based compensation costs included in our Consolidated Statements
of Income for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:

NOTE 14. STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our
stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we may repurchase our
shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with
third parties. In December 2020, our Board of Directors granted additional
authority to repurchase up to $15 billion in common stock through the end of
fiscal 2024.

During fiscal 2022, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement
("ASR") with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a
prepayment of $2.4 billion. Under the terms of the ASR, the financial
institution agreed to deliver a portion of shares to us at contract inception
and the remaining shares at settlement, which occurred in fiscal 2022. The
total number of shares delivered and average purchase price paid per share
were determined upon settlement based on the Volume Weighted Average Price
("VWAP") over the term of the ASR, less an agreed upon discount.

During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we entered into several structured stock
repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided
them with prepayments totaling $4.15 billion, $3.95 billion and $3.05 billion,
respectively. Under the terms of these structured stock repurchase agreements,
the financial institutions agreed to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals
during the respective contract terms, and the number of shares delivered each
month was determined based

83

* * *

Table of Contents

  

  

ADOBE INC.

  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

  

on the total notional amount of the contracts, the number of trading days in
the intervals and the VWAP of our stock during the intervals less an agreed
upon discount.

We enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing
shares at a guaranteed discount to the VWAP of our common stock over a
specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the
discount that we receive is expected to be higher than the foregone return on
our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit
commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the
agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return
any portion of the prepayment to us.

During fiscal 2022, we repurchased a total of 15.7 million shares, including
approximately 10.4 million shares at an average price of $375.03 through
structured repurchase agreements, as well as 5.3 million shares at an average
purchase price of $451.55 through the ASR described above. Comparatively, we
repurchased approximately 7.2 million shares at an average price of $536.17
per share in fiscal 2021 and 8.0 million shares at an average price of $376.38
per share in fiscal 2020.

For fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, the prepayments were classified as treasury
stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the payment date, though only
shares physically delivered to us by December 2, 2022, December 3, 2021 and
November 27, 2020 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As
of December 2, 2022, $583 million of prepayment remained under our outstanding
structured stock repurchase agreement.

Subsequent to December 2, 2022, as part of the December 2020 stock repurchase
authority, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a
large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of
$1.4 billion and received an initial delivery of 3.2 million shares, which
represents approximately 75% of our prepayment. Upon completion of the $1.4
billion accelerated share repurchase agreement, $5.15 billion remains under
our December 2020 authority.

NOTE 15. NET INCOME PER SHARE

Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding for the period, excluding unvested restricted stock
units and performance awards. Diluted net income per share is based upon the
weighted average common shares outstanding for the period plus dilutive
potential common shares, including unvested restricted stock units, stock
purchase rights and performance share awards using the treasury stock method.
Performance share awards are included based on the number of shares that would
be issued as if the end of the reporting period was the end of the performance
period and the result was dilutive.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income
per share for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020:

Royalties

We have royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings
and products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit
or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, which was recorded
in our cost of revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income, was
approximately $228 million, $202 million and $176 million in fiscal 2022, 2021
and 2020, respectively.

Indemnifications

In the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying
scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual
property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our
products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers
under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these
indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to
estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on
our future results of operations.

To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we
indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while
the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The
indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the
officer's or director's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future
payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements
is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that
reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts
paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements
in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal.

Legal Proceedings

In connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement
of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights, we have
been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations
or complex, protracted litigation. Intellectual property disputes and
litigation may be very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations
by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical
personnel. Although we have successfully defended or resolved past litigation
and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and
disputes. Third-party intellectual property disputes could subject us to
significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing
arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from licensing certain of our
products or offering certain of our services, subject us to injunctions
restricting our sale of products or services, cause severe disruptions to our
operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy
indemnification commitments with our customers including contractual
provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

  

In addition to intellectual property disputes, we are subject to legal
proceedings, claims, including claims relating to commercial, employment and
other matters, and investigations, including government investigations. Some
of these disputes, legal proceedings and investigations may include
speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We
consider all claims on a quarterly basis in accordance with GAAP and based on
known facts assess whether potential losses are considered reasonably possible
or probable and estimable. Based upon this assessment, we then evaluate
disclosure requirements and whether to accrue for such claims in our financial
statements. This determination is then reviewed and discussed with the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors.

We make a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability
has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the
impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and
other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Unless otherwise
specifically disclosed in this note, we have determined that no provision for
liability nor disclosure is required related to any claim against us because:
(a) there is not a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts
already recognized (if any) may be incurred with respect to such claim; (b) a
reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated; or (c) such
estimate is immaterial.

All legal costs associated with litigation are expensed as incurred.
Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, we believe that we have valid
defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against us. It is possible,
nevertheless, that our consolidated financial position, results of operations
or cash flows could be negatively affected by an unfavorable resolution of one
or more of such proceedings, claims or investigations.

In connection with our anti-piracy efforts, conducted both internally and
through organizations such as the Business Software Alliance, from time to
time we undertake litigation against alleged copyright infringers. Such
lawsuits may lead to counter-claims alleging improper use of litigation or
violation of other laws. We believe we have valid defenses with respect to
such counter-claims; however, it is possible that our consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows could be negatively affected in
any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these counter-
claims.

Senior Notes

In January 2015, we issued $1 billion of senior notes due February 1, 2025.
The related discount and issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over
the term of the notes using the effective interest method. Interest is payable
semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1.

In February 2020, we issued $500 million of senior notes due February 1, 2023,
$500 million of senior notes due February 1, 2025, $850 million of senior
notes due February 1, 2027, and $1.30 billion of senior notes due February 1,
2030. Our total proceeds of approximately $3.14 billion, net of issuance
discount, were used for general corporate purposes including repayment of debt
instruments due in fiscal 2020. The related discount and issuance costs are
amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the notes using the
effective interest method. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears on
February 1 and August 1.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we reclassified the senior notes due
February 1, 2023 as current debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of
December 2, 2022, the carrying value of our current debt was $500 million, net
of the related discount and issuance costs. We intend to repay the current
portion of our debt on or before the due date.

Our senior notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated
indebtedness. We may redeem the notes at any time, subject to a make-whole
premium. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain change of control
triggering events, we may be required to repurchase the notes, at a price
equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to
the date of repurchase. The notes do not contain financial covenants but
include covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on assets and to enter
into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to significant allowances.

Revolving Credit Agreement

In June 2022, we entered into a credit agreement ("Revolving Credit
Agreement"), providing for a five-year $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving
credit facility, which replaced our previous five-year $1 billion senior
unsecured revolving credit agreement entered into in October 2018 (the "Prior
Revolving Credit Agreement"). The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for
loans to Adobe and certain of its subsidiaries that may be designated from
time to time as additional borrowers. Pursuant to the terms of the Revolving
Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the agreement of lenders to provide
additional commitments, obtain up to an additional $500 million in
commitments, for a maximum aggregate commitment of $2 billion. At our
election, loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest at
either the (i) term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), plus a margin,
(ii) adjusted daily SOFR rate, plus a margin, (iii) alternative currency rate,
plus a margin, or (iv) base rate, which is defined as the highest of (a) the
federal funds rate plus 0.500%, (b) the agent's prime rate, or (c) term SOFR
plus 1.00%. The margin for term SOFR, adjusted daily SOFR, and alternative
currency rate loans is based on our debt ratings, and ranges from 0.460% to
0.900%. In addition, facility fees determined according to our debt ratings
are payable on the aggregate commitments, regardless of usage, quarterly in an
amount ranging from 0.04% to 0.10% per annum. We are permitted to permanently
reduce the aggregate commitment under the Revolving Credit Agreement at any
time. Subject to certain conditions stated in the Revolving Credit Agreement,
Adobe and any of its subsidiaries designated as additional borrowers may
borrow, prepay and re-borrow amounts at any time during the term of the
Revolving Credit Agreement.

The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties,
affirmative and negative covenants, including events of default and
indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders. The negative covenants
include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and indebtedness,
certain merger transactions, dispositions and other matters, all subject to
certain exceptions.

The facility will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and
payable on the maturity date unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier
upon the occurrence of certain events, including an event of default, or (b)
the maturity date is further extended upon our request, subject to the
agreement of the lenders.

As of December 2, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under this
Revolving Credit Agreement.

In connection with and at the time that we entered into the Revolving Credit
Agreement, the Prior Revolving Credit Agreement originally scheduled to expire
in October 2023 was terminated. There were no outstanding borrowings or
letters of credit issued under the Prior Revolving Credit Agreement at the
time of termination. There were no penalties paid as a result of the
termination of the Prior Revolving Credit Agreement.

NOTE 18. LEASES

We lease certain facilities and data centers under non-cancellable operating
lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2032\. We also have
one land lease that expires in 2091\. Our lease agreements do not contain any
material residual value guarantees, material variable payment provisions or
material restrictive covenants.

Operating lease expense was $121 million for fiscal 2022 and $119 million for
both fiscal 2021 and 2020. We recognized operating lease expense in cost of
revenue and operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Our
operating lease expense includes variable lease costs and is net of sublease
income, both of which are not material.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors

Adobe Inc.:

Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Adobe Inc. and
subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, the
related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three fiscal year
period ended December 2, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the
consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's
internal control over financial reporting as of December 2, 2022, based on
criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

  

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three fiscal
year period ended December 2, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 2, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

  

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial
statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements and an
opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on
our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

  

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.

  

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.

  

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

90

* * *

Table of Contents

  

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

  

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the
current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that:
(1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated
financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective,
or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not
alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken
as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,
providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts
or disclosures to which it relates.

  

Performance obligations in cloud-enabled software subscriptions

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, cloud-enabled
services are highly integrated and interrelated with on-premise or on-device
software licenses in the Company's Creative Cloud and Document Cloud
subscription offerings. Because of this, the cloud-based services and the on-
premise/on-device software licenses are not considered distinct from each
other and the applicable subscription is accounted for as a single performance
obligation.

We identified the assessment of performance obligations in these cloud-enabled
software subscription offerings as a critical audit matter. A high degree of
subjective auditor judgment was required to assess the nature of the Company's
Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, their intended benefit to
customers as an integrated offering, and the level of integration that exists
between the cloud-enabled services and the on-premise/on-device licenses.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical
audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness
of an internal control related to the assessment of distinct performance
obligations. We read the Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription
offering agreements to understand the contractual terms and conditions. We
participated in product demonstrations and performed interviews with the
Company's product and engineering department to both understand and observe
specific functionalities of the integrated offering and evaluate the nature of
the promise made to the Company's Creative Cloud and Document Cloud customers.
We evaluated the features and functionalities of the Creative Cloud and
Document Cloud subscription that can be accessed only when using the on-
premise/on-device software while connected to the Adobe cloud to assess that
customers receive the intended benefit from each solution only as an
integrated offering.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 2, 2022. Based on
their evaluation as of December 2, 2022, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended) were effective at the reasonable assurance level to
ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K was (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and regulations and (ii)
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our
internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all
fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect
the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must
be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in
all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Adobe have been
detected.

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our management assessed the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December
2, 2022. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Our
management has concluded that, as of December 2, 2022, our internal control
over financial reporting are effective based on these criteria.

KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our
financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued
an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting, which
is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during
the quarter ended December 2, 2022 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
