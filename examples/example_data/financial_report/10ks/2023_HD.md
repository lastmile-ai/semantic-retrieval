PART I

Item 1\. Business.

INTRODUCTION

The Home Depot, Inc. is the world's largest home improvement retailer based on
net sales for fiscal 2022. We offer our customers a wide assortment of
building materials, home improvement products, lawn and garden products, decor
products, and facilities maintenance, repair and operations products. We also
provide a number of services, including home improvement installation services
and tool and equipment rental. As of the end of fiscal 2022, we operated 2,322
stores located throughout the U.S. (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico
and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam), Canada, and Mexico.
The Home Depot stores average approximately 104,000 square feet of enclosed
space, with approximately 24,000 additional square feet of outside garden
area. We also maintain a network of distribution and fulfillment centers, as
well as a number of e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. When
we refer to "The Home Depot," the "Company," "we," "us" or "our" in this
report, we are referring to The Home Depot, Inc. and its consolidated
subsidiaries.

  

The Home Depot, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 1978.
Our Store Support Center (corporate headquarters) is located at 2455 Paces
Ferry Road, Atlanta, Georgia 30339. Our telephone number at that address is
(770) 433-8211.

OUR BUSINESS

OUR STRATEGY

The retail landscape has changed rapidly over the past several years, with
customer expectations constantly evolving. In fiscal 2022, we continued to
operate with agility to meet the challenges created by a fluid domestic and
global business environment, including supply chain disruptions, tight labor
market conditions, and ongoing inflationary pressures. Our ability to operate
successfully and meet the needs of our customers was due in significant part
to our investments over the past several years aimed at creating an
interconnected, frictionless shopping experience that enables our customers to
seamlessly blend the digital and physical worlds. Going forward, we will
leverage the momentum of these investments and continue to invest in our
business in support of the following goals:

•We intend to provide the best customer experience in home improvement;

•We intend to extend our position as the low-cost provider in home
improvement; and

•We intend to be the most efficient investor of capital in home improvement.

We believe that these goals will help us grow faster than the market and
deliver value to our shareholders. We are steadfast in this commitment, while
also recognizing that exercising corporate responsibility and being informed
by the needs of our other stakeholders, including our customers, associates,
supplier partners, and communities, creates value for all stakeholders,
including our shareholders.

DELIVER SHAREHOLDER VALUE

We deliver on our objective to create shareholder value through our
disciplined approach to capital allocation. Our capital allocation principles
are as follows:

•First, we intend to reinvest in our business to drive growth faster than the
market.

•Second, after meeting the needs of the business, we look to pay a quarterly
dividend, which we intend to increase as we grow earnings.

•Third, after reinvesting in our business and paying our dividend, we intend
to return excess cash to our shareholders through share repurchases.

In fiscal 2022, we invested $3.1 billion in capital expenditures to support
our business, advance our goals, and continue to build an interconnected
customer experience. We also focused on driving productivity throughout the
business to lower our costs. The combination of reinvesting in the business to
drive higher sales and supporting productivity to lower costs creates what we
refer to as a virtuous cycle, which has allowed us to improve the customer
experience, increase our competitiveness in the market, and deliver
shareholder value.

In fiscal 2022, we returned over $14 billion to shareholders in the form of
cash dividends and share repurchases. Our capital allocation is discussed
further in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.

OUR CUSTOMERS

We serve two primary customer groups -- consumers (including both DIY and DIFM
customers) and professional customers -- and have developed varying approaches
to meet their diverse needs:

DIY Customers

These customers are typically homeowners who purchase products and complete
their own projects and installations. Our associates assist these customers
both in our stores and through online resources and other media designed to
provide product and project knowledge. We also offer a variety of clinics and
workshops both to share this knowledge and to build an emotional connection
with our DIY customers.

Professional Customers (or "Pros")

These customers are primarily professional renovators/remodelers, general
contractors, maintenance professionals, handymen, property managers, building
service contractors and specialty tradespeople, such as electricians, plumbers
and painters. These customers build, renovate, remodel, repair, and maintain
residential properties, multifamily properties, hospitality properties, and
commercial facilities, including education, healthcare, government,
institutional, and office buildings.

We have a number of initiatives designed to drive growth with our Pros,
including a customized online experience, a dedicated sales force, an
extensive delivery network, our Pro Xtra loyalty program, enhanced credit
offerings, and inventory management programs. Building on our historical
strength as a destination for urgent purchase needs, we are investing in
capabilities that will help us better serve our Pros' planned purchase needs
(in-store or via our dedicated sales team), including our expanded supply
chain capabilities and advance ordering through our interconnected digital
platforms. We believe that focusing on meeting the Pros' planned purchase
needs, particularly for larger renovator/remodeler Pros, will help us drive
growth and deliver value to our shareholders.

We extended our reach in the MRO marketplace with our fiscal 2020 acquisition
of HD Supply, a leading national distributor and provider of MRO products and
related value-added services to multifamily, hospitality, healthcare, and
government housing facilities, among others, and in fiscal 2021 we integrated
our legacy Interline Brands business into HD Supply. Our MRO operations use a
distribution center-based model that sells products primarily through a
professional sales force and through e-commerce platforms and print catalogs.

We recognize the great value our Pros provide to their clients, and we strive
to make their jobs easier and help them grow their businesses. We believe that
investments aimed at deepening our relationships with our Pros are yielding
increased engagement and will continue to translate into incremental sales to
these customers.

DIFM Customers

Intersecting our DIY customers and our Pros are our DIFM customers. These
customers are typically homeowners who use Pros to complete their project or
installation. Currently, we offer installation services in a variety of
categories, such as flooring, water heaters, bath, garage doors, cabinets,
cabinet makeovers, countertops, sheds, furnaces and central air systems, and
windows. DIFM customers can purchase these services in our stores, online, or
in their homes through in-home consultations. In addition to serving our DIFM
customer needs, we believe our focus on the Pros who perform services for
these customers helps us drive higher product sales.

OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

A typical The Home Depot store stocks approximately 30,000 to 40,000 items
during the year, including both national brand name and proprietary products.
Our online product offerings complement our stores by serving as an extended
aisle, and we offer a significantly broader product assortment through our
websites and mobile applications, including homedepot.com, our primary
website; homedepot.ca and homedepot.com.mx, our websites in Canada and Mexico;
hdsupply.com, our website for our MRO products and related services;
blinds.com, our online site for custom window coverings; and
thecompanystore.com, our online site featuring textiles and decor products.

We believe our merchandising organization is a key competitive advantage,
delivering product innovation, assortment and value, which reinforces our
position as the product authority in home improvement. In fiscal 2022, we
continued to invest in merchandising resets in our stores to refine
assortments, optimize space productivity, introduce innovative new products to
our customers, and improve visual merchandising to drive a better shopping
experience. At the same time, we remain focused on offering everyday values in
our stores and online. To help our merchandising organization keep pace with
changing customer expectations and increasing desire for innovation,
localization, and personalization, we are continuing to invest in tools to
better leverage our data and drive a deeper level of collaboration with our
supplier partners. As a result, we have continued to focus on enhanced

merchandising information technology tools to help us: (1) build an
interconnected shopping experience that is tailored to our customers' shopping
intent and location; (2) provide the best value in the market; and (3)
optimize our product assortments. Our merchandising team leverages technology
and works closely with our inventory and supply chain teams, as well as our
supplier partners, to manage our assortments, drive innovation, and adjust
inventory levels to respond to fluctuations in demand, which helped us
navigate the challenges of continuing global supply chain disruption in fiscal
2022. As cost pressures have risen in several product categories in the
current environment, our tools have helped our merchandising, finance and data
analytics teams as they work with our supplier partners to manage these
pressures.

To complement our merchandising efforts, we offer a number of services for our
customers, including installation services for our DIY and DIFM customers, as
noted above. We also provide tool and equipment rentals at locations across
the U.S. and Canada, providing value and convenience for both Pros and
consumers. To improve the customer experience and continue to grow this
differentiated service offering, we are continuing to invest in more locations
(including piloting rental locations in Mexico), more tools, and better
technology.

Sourcing and Quality Assurance

We maintain a global sourcing program to obtain high-quality and innovative
products directly from manufacturers in the U.S. and around the world. During
fiscal 2022, in addition to our U.S. sourcing operations, we maintained
sourcing offices in Mexico, Canada, China, India, Vietnam and Europe. To
ensure that suppliers adhere to our high standards of social and environmental
responsibility, we also have a global responsible sourcing program. Under our
supplier contracts, our suppliers are obligated to ensure that their products
comply with applicable international, federal, state and local laws. These
contracts also require compliance with our responsible sourcing standards,
which cover a variety of expectations across multiple areas of social
compliance, including supply chain transparency, compliance with local laws,
health and safety, environmental laws and regulations, compensation, hours of
work, and prohibitions on child and forced labor. To drive accountability with
our suppliers, our standard supplier buying agreement includes a factory audit
right related to these standards, and we conduct factory audits and compliance
visits with non-Canada and non-U.S. suppliers of private branded and direct
import products. Our 2022 Responsible Sourcing Report, available on our
website at https://corporate.homedepot.com under "Responsibility > Sourcing
Responsibly," provides more information about this program. In addition, we
have both quality assurance and engineering resources dedicated to
establishing criteria and overseeing compliance with safety, quality and
performance standards for our private branded products.

Intellectual Property

Our business has one of the most recognized brands in North America. As a
result, we believe that The Home Depot® trademark has significant value and is
an important factor in the marketing of our products, e-commerce, stores and
business. We have registered or applied for registration of trademarks,
service marks, copyrights and internet domain names, both domestically and
internationally, for use in our business, including our proprietary brands
such as HDX®, Husky®, Hampton Bay®, Home Decorators Collection®, Glacier Bay®,
Vigoro®, Everbilt® and Lifeproof®. The duration of trademark registrations
varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and
may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their
registrations are properly maintained.

We also maintain patent portfolios relating to our business operations, retail
services, and products, and we seek to patent or otherwise protect innovations
we incorporate into our business. Patents generally have a term of twenty
years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built
over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent
portfolio vary. Although our patents have value, no single patent is essential
to our business. We continuously assess our merchandising departments and
product lines for opportunities to expand the assortment of products offered
within The Home Depot's portfolio of proprietary and exclusive brands.

COMPETITION AND SEASONALITY

Our industry is highly competitive, very fragmented, and evolving. As a
result, we face competition for customers for our products and services from a
variety of retailers, suppliers, service providers, and distributors and
manufacturers that sell products directly to their respective customer bases.
These competitors range from traditional brick-and-mortar, to multichannel, to
exclusively online, and they include a number of other home improvement
retailers; electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses; and
lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with
specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and
national hardware stores, paint stores, specialty and mass digital retailers,
warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, MRO distributors, home
decor retailers, and other retailers, as well as with

providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental. The
internet facilitates competitive entry, price transparency, and comparison
shopping, increasing the level of competition we face.

Both in-store and online, we compete primarily based on customer experience,
price, quality, product availability and assortment, and delivery options. We
also compete based on store location and appearance, presentation of
merchandise, and ease of shopping experience. Our Pros also look for a
dedicated sales team, competitive credit and pricing options, project planning
tools, and product depth and job lot quantities, particularly for their
planned purchase needs. Furthermore, with respect to delivery options,
customers are increasingly seeking faster and/or guaranteed delivery times,
low-price or free shipping, and/or convenient pickup options. Our ability to
be competitive on delivery and pickup times, options and costs depends on many
factors, including the success of our supply chain investments, described more
fully under "Our Supply Chain" below.

Our business is subject to seasonal influences. Generally, our highest volume
of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter, as we move into the spring
season in the regions in which we operate.

INTERCONNECTED SHOPPING EXPERIENCE

We continue to enhance our capabilities to provide our customers with a
frictionless interconnected shopping experience across our stores, online, on
the job site, and in their homes, focusing on continued investments in our
website and mobile apps to enhance the digital customer experience.

Digital Experience

Enhancements to our digital properties are critical for our increasingly
interconnected customers, who often research products online and check
available inventory before going into one of our stores to view the products
in person or talk to an associate and then make their purchase in store or
online. While in the store, customers may also go online to access ratings and
reviews, compare prices, view our extended assortment, and purchase additional
products. Our investments in a truly interconnected experience are focused on
bringing together the power of our physical retail presence and the
frictionless interaction of our digital capabilities.

A significant majority of the traffic in our digital channels is on mobile
devices. Mobile customers expect more simplicity and relevancy in their
digital interactions. As a result, we have made investments to our digital
properties to improve the overall presentation and ease of navigation for the
user. We have also enhanced the "shopability" of an online product by
including more information on the product's landing page, including related
products and/or parts of a collection, as well as various fulfillment options.
We believe our focus on improving search capabilities, site functionality,
category presentation, product content, speed to checkout, and enhanced
fulfillment options has yielded higher traffic, better conversion and
continued sales growth.

Further, we do not view the interconnected shopping experience as a specific
transaction; rather, we believe it encompasses an entire journey from
inspiration and know-how, to purchase and fulfillment, to post-purchase care
and support. Customers expect more personalized messaging, so we are
continuing to focus on connecting marketing activities with the online and in-
store experiences to create seamless engagement across channels. From the
inspirational point of the purchase journey to providing product know-how, we
continue to invest in the infrastructure and capabilities needed to deliver
the most relevant marketing messages to our customers based upon what is
important to them today.

Store Experience

Our stores remain the hub of our business, and we continue to invest to
improve the customer shopping experience through easier navigation and
increased convenience and speed of checkout. In fiscal 2022, we continued to
leverage the investments made in our stores over the past several years to
operate effectively and meet changing customer expectations. These investments
include wayfinding signage and store refresh packages; self-service lockers,
online order storage areas at front entrances and curbside pickup to provide
convenient pickup options for online orders; electronic shelf label
capabilities; and the re-design of front-end areas, including reconfigured
service desks, improved layouts in checkout areas, and expanded and enhanced
self-checkout options. To improve the customer's experience in our stores, we
have also empowered our customers with additional self-help tools, including
mobile app-enabled store navigation. Our app provides store-specific maps,
which allow customers to pinpoint the exact location of an item on their
mobile devices. We believe these investments are driving higher customer
satisfaction scores, and we will continue to invest to improve the customer
experience going forward.

Investing in Associate Productivity. We continually strive to improve our
store operations for our associates. Our goal is to remove complexity and
inefficient processes from the stores to allow our associates to focus on our
customers. To this end, we have continued to focus our efforts in such areas
as optimizing product flow to decrease the amount of time a store associate
spends locating product and to improve on-shelf product availability; creating

simpler order management system; expanding in-aisle, real-time mobile learning
tools for our associates' own development and to assist with customer
questions; and using labor model tools to better align associate activity with
customer needs. For several years, our associates have used web-enabled
handheld devices to help them more efficiently meet the needs of the business
and serve customers. In fiscal 2022, we began rolling out the next generation
of digital phones to our stores, which we call "hdPhones," so that each
associate will have a digital device during their shift. The new devices offer
enhanced functionality to allow associates to readily query inventory, access
applications that support customer service, and drive on-shelf availability of
product.

Investing in Safety. We are committed to maintaining a safe shopping and
working environment for our customers and associates. We empower trained EH&S
associates to evaluate, develop, implement and enforce policies, processes and
programs on a Company-wide basis. Our EH&S policies are woven into our
everyday operations and are part of The Home Depot culture. Common program
elements include daily store inspection checklists (by department); routine
follow-up audits from our store-based safety team members and regional,
district and store operations field teams; equipment enhancements and
preventative maintenance programs to promote physical safety; departmental
merchandising safety standards; training and education programs for all
associates, with varying degrees of training provided based on an associate's
role and responsibilities; and awareness, communication and recognition
programs designed to drive operational awareness and an understanding of EH&S
matters.

OUR SUPPLY CHAIN

We continue to focus on building best-in-class competitive advantages in our
supply chain to be responsive to our customers' expectations for how, when and
where they choose to receive our products and services. As part of enhancing
the interconnected shopping experience, we continue to invest in expanding our
supply chain network, with the goal of achieving the fastest, most efficient
and most reliable delivery capabilities in home improvement. Our efforts are
focused on ensuring product availability and increasing the speed and
reliability of delivery for our customers while managing our costs. Our supply
chain investments have helped us to operate effectively and meet our
customers' needs throughout the challenging environment over the past few
years.

We centrally forecast and replenish the vast majority of our store products
through sophisticated inventory management systems and utilize our network of
distribution centers to serve both our stores' and customers' needs. Our
supply chain includes multiple distribution center platforms in the U.S.,
Canada, and Mexico tailored to meet the needs of our stores and customers
based on types of products, location, transportation, and delivery
requirements. These platforms include rapid deployment centers, stocking
distribution centers, bulk distribution centers, and direct fulfillment
centers, among others. As part of the expansion of our supply chain, we have
invested to further automate and mechanize our rapid deployment center network
to drive efficiency and faster movement of product.

We are also continuing to expand our fulfillment network, investing in a
significant number of new fulfillment facilities to drive speed and
reliability of delivery for our customers and to help us ultimately meet our
goal of reaching 90% of the U.S. population with same or next day delivery for
extended home improvement product offerings, including big and bulky products.
These facilities include omni-channel fulfillment centers, which deliver
product directly to customers, and market delivery operations, which function
as local hubs to consolidate freight for dispatch to customers for the final
mile of delivery, with a focus on appliances. In fiscal 2022, we realized our
goal to control more of our appliance delivery end-to-end and began managing
all of our appliance delivery volume through our market delivery operations.
We have also added flatbed distribution centers, which handle large items like
lumber and building materials that are transported on flatbed trucks. As of
the end of fiscal 2022, we have opened a number of additional fulfillment
facilities, and we will continue to build out our fulfillment network to
support our business. Our network is designed to create a competitive
advantage with unique, industry-leading capabilities for home improvement
needs for both Pros and consumers.

In addition to our distribution and fulfillment centers, we leverage our
stores as a network of convenient customer pickup, return, and delivery
fulfillment locations. Our premium real estate footprint provides a distinct
structural and competitive advantage. For customers who shop online and wish
to pick up or return merchandise at, or have merchandise delivered from, our
stores, we have implemented four interconnected retail programs: BOSS, BOPIS,
BODFS, and BORIS. We also provide curbside pickup to complement our BOPIS
offerings, in addition to the self-service lockers at the front entrance of
many of our stores. We also offer express car and van delivery service that
covers over 80% of the U.S. population. For fiscal 2022, approximately 50% of
our U.S. online orders were fulfilled through a store. We also continue to
focus on developing new capabilities to improve both efficiency and customer
experience in our store delivery program. Our strategic intent is to have a
portfolio of efficient, timely and reliable sources and methods of delivery to
choose from, optimizing order fulfillment and delivery based on customer
needs, inventory locations and available transportation options.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

We view environmental, social and governance matters through the lens of our
business, with an understanding that if we support our associates, our
customers, our supplier partners, and the communities we serve, we also
support our business and create long-term value for our shareholders. As a
result, we believe that ESG is fundamentally embedded in our operations and
culture. We organize our efforts around three pillars: (1) Focus on Our
People, (2) Operate Sustainably, and (3) Strengthen Our Communities.
Highlights of each of these pillars are set forth below. For further
information on our three pillars and other ESG-related matters, see our annual
ESG Report, available on our website at
https://corporate.homedepot.com/responsibility.

Focus on Our People

Our culture and our associates provide intangible and hard-to-replicate
competitive advantages, which have been key to helping us navigate challenging
market conditions. Our associates are essential to providing the experience
and service that our customers demand. To preserve and protect that customer
experience, we focus on cultivating a compelling associate experience, which
we believe supports our ability to attract and retain our associates. This
includes investing in competitive wages and benefits while also providing the
culture, tools, training and development opportunities that make working at
The Home Depot an enjoyable and rewarding experience. These actions are the
foundation of our key tenets of putting customers first and taking care of our
associates.

Culture and Values. The Home Depot has a strong commitment to ethics and
integrity, and we are a values- and culture-centric business. Our commitment
to our core values drives our approach to human capital management. Our
culture is based on our servant leadership philosophy represented by the
inverted pyramid, which puts primary importance on our customers and our
associates by positioning them at the top, with senior management at the base
in a support role. We bring our culture to life through our core values, which
serve as the foundation of our business and as the guiding principles behind
the decisions we make every day.

![hd-20230129_g2.jpg](hd-20230129_g2.jpg)![hd-20230129_g3.jpg](hd-20230129_g3.jpg)

Our values also guide our efforts to create an environment that will help us
attract and retain skilled associates in the competitive marketplace for
talent. We empower our associates to deliver a superior customer experience by
living our values, and we position our associates to embody our core values by
integrating the importance of our culture into ongoing development programs,
performance management practices, and rewards programs. Leaders participate in
programs designed to build and strengthen our culture, such as training on
leadership skills, cross-functional collaboration, inclusiveness, and
associate engagement, and all associates receive annual training on
unconscious bias. Our core values are at the root of our human capital
management programs.

Our Workforce. At the end of fiscal 2022, we employed approximately 471,600
associates, of whom approximately 46,500 were salaried, with the remainder
compensated on an hourly basis. Set forth below is the geographic makeup of
our workforce:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Geographic Location| | Number of Associates| | % of Total Workforce  
United States| | 418,900| | 88.8%

Talent Attraction and Development. As we attract and hire new associates, we
strive to create a customer-like experience for jobseekers as they progress
through the steps of our recruiting process by focusing on speed and
personalization. We employ targeted marketing practices through our careers
website, which personalizes the user's experience based on jobseeker location
and searching behavior. Jobseekers can also apply for roles from anywhere
using desktop or mobile devices. Once a jobseeker has applied for a role and
has been selected to move forward in the recruiting process, we provide self-
service by allowing candidates to schedule or reschedule pre-hire activities
directly from their mobile device. Lastly, we created a quick hiring process
for candidates by leveraging job-matching automation that matches candidates
to jobs that fit their needs.

We offer all of our associates the opportunity to benefit from robust
development opportunities. Our Home Depot University, or "HDU," program, is a
key part of this development, offering relevant content through multiple
platforms, including instructor-led classes, e-learning, mobile learning, and
additional online resources. We invest in ongoing growth and development by
integrating our culture and values into our performance management practices,
providing coaching through continuous leader support, and empowering our
associates to learn new skills at their own pace through mobile applications
our associates can access at any time. We equip our leaders with the tools
they need to develop themselves and their teams through several programs
designed to help them lead inclusively, empower their teams, and serve as
mentors for our associates.

In fiscal 2022, we supported both associate development and engagement by
starting the year with a new store leadership structure. We created new
management positions in our stores focused on the customer service experience,
increasing the number of managers on the floor at any given time. This new
structure frees up time for other store leaders to devote to associate
training and development. The result is an improved customer and associate
experience, while also providing new career paths for associates.

Associate Engagement. Associate engagement is the emotional commitment
associates have to The Home Depot. It is vital to our culture and to our
success. We create an engaging workplace by continuously listening to and
acting on associate feedback. We provide several pulse check surveys to
associates throughout the year that help us determine how emotionally
connected those associates are to our customers, the Company, their jobs,
fellow associates, and leaders. In addition, our annual Voice of the Associate
survey, which includes all associates, serves as our primary means of gauging
associates' level of engagement within their roles. We use the feedback from
these surveys to help improve the overall associate experience. We also
maintain a digital associate engagement platform that links associates with
common interests and fuels connections to co-workers and Company leaders.
Additionally, we have a number of programs to recognize stores and individual
associates for exceptional customer service and demonstrating our core values.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Guided by our core values and grounded in our
culture, we believe that having a diverse, equitable and inclusive Company is
key to our success. We are focused on building a workplace and retail space
that reflect the customers and communities we are proud to serve. We strive to
maintain a Company where our associates are valued and respected and feel a
sense of belonging in the workplace, so that they can provide the customer
experience that supports our business. Our Office of Diversity, Equity and
Inclusion supports our focus on associate diversity, supplier diversity, and
engagement with our communities. Below is the fiscal 2022 diversity data for
our U.S. associates:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

--------

(1) Does not include officers.

Note: Certain percentages may not sum to totals due to rounding.

As a Company, we have identified several priorities designed to guide our
efforts to enhance diversity, equity and inclusion. We believe these
associate-, supplier- and community-focused priorities will further enhance
our customers' experience and make a sustainable difference within the
workplace, marketplace, and community:

•Associate Engagement

◦Increase diverse representation throughout our organization

◦Create an environment where every associate feels included and valued for who
they are

◦Promote equal opportunity in recruitment, hiring, training, development and
advancement

Compensation and Benefits. Consistent with our core values, we take care of
our people by offering competitive compensation and comprehensive benefits
programs. We continuously make wage investments to ensure our compensation
packages reflect the evolving circumstances across our markets, and our
profit-sharing program for hourly associates provides semi-annual cash awards
for performance against our business plan. We transitioned from the enhanced
pay and benefits we provided for our associates in fiscal 2020 to alleviate
some of the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic to permanent
compensation enhancements for our frontline, hourly associates, which we have
continued to make since fiscal 2020. Our associates can take advantage of a
range of benefits, including healthcare and wellness programs, vacation and
leave of absence benefits including parental leave and paid sick/personal time
off, a 401(k) match, our ESPPs, personal finance education and advisory
services, assistance programs to help with managing personal and work-life
challenges, family support programs, and educational assistance.

Operate Sustainably

We have a long-standing and substantial commitment to sustainable business
operations, understanding that if we make our operations more efficient and
sustainable, we can support both our business and the environment. This
philosophy extends from the products and services we offer to our customers;
to our store construction, maintenance and operations; to our supply chain and
packaging initiatives; to our ethical sourcing program. As we strive to
operate sustainably, we have focused on efforts that help protect the climate,
reduce our environmental impact, and source products responsibly, and we have
set goals to drive progress in these areas.

Our 2022 ESG Report, available on our website at
https://corporate.homedepot.com/responsibility, includes more information on
our goals, as well as specific initiatives we have in place to help achieve
these goals. Below are highlights of our sustainability strategy.

Our Environmental Goals. We currently have several goals to help address
climate impact and reduce our environmental footprint:

Our Environmental Programs and Initiatives. In order to progress against our
goals, we have a number of environmentally-focused programs and initiatives,
including:

•Store Operations and Renewable/Alternative Energy. We have reduced store
energy consumption through initiatives such as LED lighting upgrades;
installation of energy-efficient HVAC systems; participation in demand
mitigation; on-site alternative or renewable energy projects such as fuel
cells and solar panels; and contracts with off-site wind and solar power
providers. We have continued to work toward our goal to produce or procure
renewable electricity equivalent to the electricity needs for all Home Depot
facilities by the end of fiscal 2030. We have also continued our focus on
saving water, implementing smart irrigation systems capable of reducing
irrigation-related water use in more than 500 U.S. stores.

•Product Offerings. Through our Eco ActionsTM program, we have helped our
customers more easily identify products related to five areas: carbon
emissions, circularity, responsible chemistry, sustainable forestry, and water
use. Under our Eco Actions program, we sell ENERGY STAR® certified appliances;
WaterSense®-labeled bath faucets, showerheads, aerators, toilets, and
irrigation controllers; LED light bulbs; tankless water heaters; and many
other products. These products, through proper use, help our customers save
money on their utility bills and reduce their environmental impact. Through
Eco Actions, we also provide customers with resources, such as project
tutorials, to take individual action on environmental issues.

•In-Store Recycling Programs. We offer customer-facing recycling programs in
the U.S., including in-store recycling programs for compact fluorescent light
bulbs, rechargeable batteries, and lead acid batteries.

•Chemical Strategy. We are committed to increasing our assortment of products
that meet high environmental standards, and we encourage our suppliers to
invest in developing environmentally-innovative products. We periodically
evaluate our Chemical Strategy to ensure our approach and goals are
appropriate.

•Sustainable Packaging. In addition to our goal related to eliminating EPS and
PVC from our private-brand products, we are continually working with our
suppliers to find ways to make product packaging more recyclable or simply use
less materials, such as through the reduction of single-use plastics.

•Supply Chain Optimization. Through our supply chain initiatives such as space
sharing and optimization technology, we are working to maximize our use of
every mile to make our supply chain more efficient. We also utilize hydrogen
fuel cell technology in a number of our forklifts to make our supply chain
even more environmentally responsible.

•CDP Participation. We are a long-standing participant in the annual CDP
Climate Change reporting process. CDP is an independent, international, not-
for-profit organization providing a global system for companies and cities to
measure, disclose, manage, and share environmental information. In February
2023, we received a score of "B" from CDP. We have also announced that we plan
to begin participating in CDP's Forests reporting process.

•Assessment of SBTi Goals. In fiscal 2021, we announced plans to adopt, by the
end of fiscal 2023, new Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) goals to
reduce Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions in line with Paris Agreement goals. Adoption
of SBTi goals would build on our current science-based goals to reduce Scope 1
and 2 carbon emissions by 2.1% per year, to achieve a 40% reduction by the end
of fiscal 2030 and a 50% reduction by the end of fiscal 2035. In fiscal 2022,
we continued to work on evaluating potential SBTi goals.

Over the past several years, our commitment to sustainable operations has
resulted in a number of environmental awards and recognitions. In 2022, we
received the following awards: an EPA WaterSense® Partner of the Year Award
for our commitment to offering and promoting water-efficient products; an EPA
SmartWay High Performer Award, which recognized us as an industry leader in
improving freight efficiency and environmental performance; an EPA Safer
Choice Partner of the Year Award, which recognizes achievement in products
with safer chemicals that furthers innovative source reduction; and an EPA
ENERGY STAR® Partner of the Year Award for our contribution to promoting
energy efficiency.

Strengthen our Communities

One of our core values is "Giving Back," and we support our communities in a
number of ways. The Home Depot Foundation focuses on improving the homes and
lives of U.S. veterans, assisting communities affected by natural disasters,
and training skilled tradespeople to fill the labor gap. The Company and The
Home Depot Foundation are partnering with industry leaders on training
programs to train the next generation of skilled tradespeople and help them
find careers in the home improvement industry through our Path to Pro program,
which includes a new career networking site to connect skilled tradespeople to
industry Pros. Our Team Depot associate volunteers also extend

the mission of the Home Depot Foundation in communities across the country,
donating thousands of volunteer hours each year on a wide variety of projects.

We partner with diverse suppliers and organizations to further support our
diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. As noted above, our Office of
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion partners with community organizations on
programs designed to close the wealth gap and enhance education outcomes
across underserved and underrepresented communities. To further advance
diversity, equity and inclusion in our communities, we have a supplier
diversity program through which we provide supplier development and other
resources to our diverse suppliers, and in fiscal 2021 we launched a Tier II
supplier diversity program that aims to drive more spending from our direct
suppliers to diverse suppliers. In fiscal 2022, the Company joined the Billion
Dollar Roundtable Inc., or BDR, a not-for-profit organization that promotes
supplier diversity excellence and best practices. The BDR consists of
U.S.-based corporations that spend $1.0 billion or more annually with
minority- and woman-owned suppliers. We are working to cultivate a supplier
base that creates long-lasting growth and mutual business success, while
reflecting the diversity of our customers and strengthening the communities in
which our customers and associates live.

Please see our 2022 ESG Report for additional information about our efforts to
support the communities we serve.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

As a company with both U.S. and international operations, we are subject to
the laws of the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the
rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among
jurisdictions. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations has not had,
and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures,
results of operations, or competitive position as compared to prior periods.

AVAILABLE INFORMATION

Our internet website is www.homedepot.com. We make available on the Investor
Relations section of our website, free of charge, our Annual Reports to
shareholders, Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q,
Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements, and Forms 3, 4 and 5, and
amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing
such documents with, or furnishing such documents to, the SEC.

We include website addresses throughout this report for reference only. The
information contained on these websites is not incorporated by reference into
this report.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Our business, results of operations, and financial condition are subject to
numerous risks and uncertainties. In connection with any investment decision
with respect to our securities, you should carefully consider the following
risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this report and
our other filings with the SEC. Additional risks and uncertainties not
presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our
business operations. Should any of these risks materialize, our business,
results of operations, financial condition and future prospects could be
negatively impacted, which in turn could affect the trading value of our
securities. You should read these Risk Factors in conjunction with Part II,
Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements and related
notes in Item 8\.

STRATEGIC RISKS

Strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products
and services and could decrease our market share.

Our industry is highly competitive, highly fragmented, and evolving. As a
result, we face competition for customers for our products and services from a
variety of retailers, suppliers, service providers, and distributors and
manufacturers that sell products directly to their respective customer bases.
These competitors range from traditional brick-and-mortar, to multichannel, to
exclusively online, and they include a number of other home improvement
retailers; electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses; and
lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with
specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and
national hardware stores, paint stores, specialty and mass digital retailers,
warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, MRO distributors, home
decor retailers, and other retailers, as well as with providers of home
improvement services and tool and equipment rental. The internet facilitates
competitive entry, price transparency, and comparison shopping, increasing the
level of competition we face.

We compete primarily based on customer experience, price, quality, product
availability and assortment, and delivery options, both in-store and online.
We also compete based on store location and appearance, presentation of
merchandise, and ease of shopping experience. Our Pros also look for a
dedicated sales team, competitive credit

and pricing options, project planning tools, and product depth and job lot
quantities, particularly for their planned purchase needs. Furthermore,
customers are increasingly shopping online and seeking faster and/or
guaranteed delivery times, low-price or free shipping, and/or convenient
pickup options. Our ability to be competitive on delivery and pickup times,
options and costs depends on many factors, including leveraging the momentum
of our strategic investments in our supply chain and our interconnected retail
capabilities to further enhance the customer shopping experience. Failure to
successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery and pickup
options could negatively impact our profit margins and the demand for our
products.

We use our marketing, advertising and promotional programs to drive customer
traffic and compete more effectively, and we must regularly assess and adjust
our efforts to address changes in the competitive landscape. Intense
competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors, such as through
aggressive promotional pricing or liquidation events, or our inability to
adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape, could
adversely affect our prices, our margins, or demand for our products and
services. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these
competitive pressures, including through the delivery of a superior
interconnected customer experience or through maintenance of effective sales
and marketing, advertising or promotional programs leveraging both our digital
and physical platforms, our market share and our financial performance could
be adversely affected. In addition, we are operating in a highly inflationary
environment. If inflation increases beyond our ability to control our related
costs, we may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect
of the various cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand, or
it may adversely affect our ability to compete based on price.

We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs,
expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with our
customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.

The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and
respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics; shifts in consumer
preferences, expectations and needs; and unexpected weather conditions, public
health issues (including pandemics and related impacts), natural disasters, or
changes in the macroeconomic environment that impact our customers, while also
managing appropriate inventory levels in our stores and distribution or
fulfillment centers and maintaining an excellent customer experience. It is
difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will
demand. As our customers expect a more personalized experience, our ability to
collect, use and protect relevant customer data is important to our ability to
effectively meet their expectations. Our ability to collect and use that data,
however, is subject to a number of external factors, including the impact of
legislation or regulations governing data privacy and security and customer
expectations around data collection and use. In addition, each of our primary
customer groups has different needs and expectations, many of which evolve as
the demographics in a particular customer group change. Customer preferences
and expectations related to sustainability of products and operations are also
changing. If we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to
meet the individual needs and expectations of or within a customer group, we
may lose market share with respect to those customers.

Customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive
products or services are also becoming more demanding. Customers routinely and
increasingly use technology and a variety of electronic devices and digital
platforms to rapidly compare products and prices, read product reviews,
determine real-time product availability, and purchase products, and new
channels and tools to expand the customer experience appear and change
rapidly. Our Pros also look for additional capabilities, including a dedicated
sales team, competitive credit and pricing options, project planning tools,
and product depth and job lot quantities, particularly for their planned
purchase needs. Once products are purchased, customers seek alternate options
for delivery of those products, including advance ordering through digital
platforms for Pros, and they often expect quick, timely, and low-price or free
delivery and/or convenient pickup options. We must continually anticipate and
adapt to these changes in the shopping and purchasing process by continuing to
adjust and enhance the online and in-store customer experience as well as our
delivery options. The coordinated operation of our network of physical stores,
distribution facilities, and online platforms is fundamental to the success of
our interconnected strategy. We cannot guarantee that our current or future
fulfillment options will be maintained and implemented successfully or that we
will be able to meet customer expectations on delivery or pickup times,
options and costs. In addition, as our customers continue to leverage our
enhanced interconnected shopping and fulfillment options, a greater
concentration of online sales with direct fulfillment could result in a
reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores, which would, in turn, reduce
the opportunities for cross-selling of merchandise that such traffic creates
and could reduce our overall sales and adversely affect our financial
performance. A greater concentration of online sales with direct fulfillment
could also result in higher costs for delivery, potentially impacting our
profit margins.

Failure to provide a relevant or effective online customer experience in a
timely manner that keeps pace with technological developments and dynamic
customer expectations; to maintain appropriate inventory; to provide quick and
low-price or free delivery alternatives and convenient pickup options; to
differentiate the customer experience for our primary customer groups; to
effectively implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment; or
to otherwise timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences,
expectations and home improvement needs could adversely affect our
relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services, and
our market share.

A positive brand and reputation are critical to our business success, and, if
our brand and reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our
relationships with our customers, current and potential associates, suppliers,
vendors, and shareholders, and, consequently, our business and results of
operations or the price of our stock.

Our brand and reputation are critical to attracting customers, current and
potential associates, suppliers and vendors to do business with us. We must
continue to manage and protect our brand and reputation. Negative incidents
can erode trust and confidence quickly, and adverse publicity about us could
damage our brand and reputation; undermine our customers' confidence in us;
reduce demand for our products and services; affect our ability to recruit,
engage, motivate and retain associates; attract regulatory scrutiny; and
impact our relationships with current and potential suppliers and vendors.
Further, our actual or perceived position or lack of position on social,
environmental, governance, political, public policy, economic, geopolitical,
or other sensitive issues, and any perceived lack of transparency about those
matters, could harm our reputation with certain groups. Customers are also
increasingly using social media to provide feedback and information about our
Company, including our products and services, in a manner that can be quickly
and broadly disseminated. Negative sentiment about the Company shared over
social media, or misinformation from fraudulent accounts impersonating the
Company, could impact our brand and reputation, whether or not it is based in
fact.

The execution of initiatives to expand our supply chain and enhance the
interconnected shopping experience could disrupt our operations in the near
term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or
might fail.

We continue to invest in our interconnected retail strategy, including by
making significant investments to expand our supply chain. These investments
are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue
to provide high-quality service to our customers; simplify customer
interactions; provide our customers with a more interconnected shopping
experience; better address Pro planned purchase needs; and create the fastest,
most efficient delivery network for home improvement products. Failure to
choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the
right pace could disrupt our operations. Executing our interconnected retail
strategy requires continual investment in our operations and information
technology systems, as well as the development and execution of new processes,
systems and support. Building out our supply chain also involves significant
real estate projects as we expand our distribution network, requiring us to
identify and secure available locations with appropriate characteristics
needed to support the different types of facilities. If we are unable to
effectively manage the volume, timing, nature, location, and cost of these
investments, projects and changes, our business operations and financial
results could be materially and adversely affected. The cost and potential
problems, defects of design, and interruptions associated with the
implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing
third-party service providers, employing new online tools and services,
implementing new technologies, implementing and restructuring support systems
and processes, securing appropriate facility locations, and addressing impacts
on inventory levels, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations
in the near term, lead to product availability issues, and impact our
profitability.

In addition, our stores are a key element of our interconnected retail
strategy, serving as the hub of our customers' interconnected shopping
experience. We have an aging store base that requires maintenance, investment,
and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our
customers desire. We also need to identify and secure available locations with
appropriate characteristics for new stores to ensure we can continue to serve
our customers effectively. Our investments in our stores may not deliver the
relevant shopping experience our customers expect or fully support an
interconnected shopping experience. We must also maintain a safe store
environment for our customers and associates, as well as protect against loss
or theft of our inventory (also called "shrink"), including as a result of
organized retail crime. High rates of shrink, which we continue to experience,
or an unsafe store environment, requires operational changes that may increase
costs and adversely impact the customer and associate experience.

Our investments to enhance our interconnected shopping experience and expand
our supply chain might not provide the anticipated benefits, might take longer
than expected to complete or realize anticipated benefits, or

might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive
position and our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

If we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and
relationships with certain suppliers of both brand name and proprietary
products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to
differentiate ourselves from our competitors.

As part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic
alliances and exclusive relationships with certain suppliers to market
products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. We have also
developed relationships with certain suppliers to allow us to market
proprietary products that are comparable to national brands. Our proprietary
products differentiate us from other retailers and generally carry higher
margins than national brand products. If we are unable to manage and expand
these alliances and relationships, maintain favorable terms with current
suppliers, or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and
proprietary products, we may not be able to effectively execute product
differentiation, which may impact our sales and gross margin results.

Our strategic transactions involve risks, which could have an adverse impact
on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we may not
realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions.

We regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including
mergers, acquisitions, investments, alliances, and other growth and market
expansion strategies. We generally expect that these transactions will result
in sales increases, cost savings, synergies, enhanced capabilities or various
other benefits. Assessing the viability and realizing the benefits of these
transactions is subject to significant uncertainty. For each of our
acquisitions, we need to determine the appropriate level of integration of the
target company's products, services, associates, and information technology,
financial, human resources, compliance, and other systems and processes, and
then successfully manage that integration into our corporate structure.
Integration can be a complex and time-consuming process, and if the
integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of
time, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the
acquisition. In addition, the integration of businesses may create complexity
in our financial systems, internal controls, technology and cybersecurity
systems, and operations and may make them more difficult to manage. Even if
the target companies are successfully integrated, the acquisitions may fail to
further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased
competition or challenges with respect to our products or services, and expose
us to additional risks and liabilities. Strategic transactions may also be
subject to significant regulatory uncertainty. The changing enforcement
landscape may result in additional costs or delays that affect the anticipated
outcome of a transaction. Any failure in the execution of a strategic
transaction or investment, our approach to the integration of an acquired
asset or business, or achievement of synergies or other benefits could result
in slower growth, higher than expected costs, the recording of an impairment
of goodwill or other intangible assets, and other actions which could
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

OPERATIONAL RISKS

Our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain highly
qualified associates to provide excellent customer service and to support our
strategic initiatives while also controlling our labor costs.

Our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge
from our associates. To meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we
must attract, develop and retain a large number of highly qualified associates
and maintain a productive relationship with those associates. Our ability to
meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to numerous
external factors, including increased market pressures with respect to
prevailing wage rates, unemployment levels, and health and other insurance
costs; the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations,
employment, immigration, minimum wage, and healthcare benefits; changing
demographics and expectations among the workforce; public health concerns; and
our reputation within the labor market. We also compete with other retail
businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest
significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level
of job satisfaction. These positions often have high turnover rates, which can
lead to increased training and retention costs, particularly in a competitive
labor market. We have faced and may continue to face additional challenges in
recruiting and retaining associates due to wage pressure; flexible scheduling
needs; disruption in the availability of childcare; challenges related to a
remote or hybrid working environment for associates who work in our store
support centers; and health and safety concerns. We are also subject to labor
union efforts to organize groups of our associates from time to time and, if
successful, those organizational efforts may decrease our operational
flexibility and efficiency, and/or otherwise negatively impact our operations
or reputation. These factors, together with growing competition among
potential employers, have resulted in and may continue to result in increased
salaries, benefits, or other employee-related

costs, and/or may impair our ability to recruit and retain associates, which
could have an adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition
and results of operations.

In addition, to execute our interconnected retail strategy, including our
supply chain investments, we must attract and retain a large number of skilled
professionals, including technology professionals, to implement our ongoing
technology and other investments. The market for these professionals is very
competitive. An inability to provide wages and/or benefits, including remote
or hybrid work flexibility, that are competitive within the markets in which
we operate could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract
associates. Further, changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect
our labor costs.

Additionally, our ability to successfully execute organizational changes,
including management transitions within the Company's senior leadership, and
to effectively motivate and retain associates is critical to our business
success. If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified associates,
or manage leadership transitions successfully, our ability to effectively
manage our strategy may be negatively impacted, the quality of service we
provide to our customers may decrease, and our financial performance may be
adversely affected.

A failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely
affect our business.

We rely extensively on information technology systems and related personnel to
collect, process, retain, manage, transmit, and protect transactions and data.
Some of these systems are managed or provided by third-party service
providers, including certain cloud platform providers. In managing our
business, we also rely heavily on the integrity of, security of, and
consistent access to, operational and financial data for information such as
sales, customer data, supplier data, associate data, job applicant data,
partner data, demand forecasting, merchandise ordering, inventory
replenishment, supply chain management, payment processing, order fulfillment,
customer service, and post-purchase matters. For these information technology
systems, applications, and processes to operate effectively, we or our service
providers must maintain and update them. Delays in the maintenance, updates,
upgrading, or patching of these systems, applications or processes could
impair, and on occasion have impaired, their effectiveness or could expose us
to security risks. Our systems and the third-party systems with which we
interact are subject to and on occasion have experienced damage or
interruption from a number of causes, including power and other critical
infrastructure outages; computer and telecommunications failures; computer
viruses; data or security breaches; internal or external data theft or misuse;
cyber-attacks, including the use of malicious codes, worms, phishing,
smishing, vishing, spyware, denial of service attacks, and ransomware;
responsive containment measures by us that may involve voluntarily taking
systems offline; natural disasters and catastrophic events such as fires,
floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, or other extreme weather events;
public health concerns, such as pandemics and quarantines; military conflicts,
acts of war, terrorism or civil unrest; other systems outages; inadequate or
ineffective redundancy; and design or usage errors or malfeasance by our
associates, contractors or third-party service providers. In addition, as more
business activities have shifted online, and as many of our store support
associates continue to work in a remote or hybrid environment, we face an
increased risk due to the potential failure of internal or external
information technology infrastructure as well as increased cybersecurity
threats and attempts to breach our security networks.

Although we and our third-party service providers seek to maintain our
respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of
compromise of the integrity, security and consistent operations of these
systems, such efforts are not always successful. As a result, we or our
service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations
of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which
could significantly disrupt our operations or impair data security; impact our
ability to operate or access communications, financial or banking systems; be
costly, time-consuming and resource-intensive to remedy; and adversely impact
our reputation and relationship with our customers, suppliers, shareholders or
regulators.

In addition, we are currently making, and expect to continue to make,
substantial investments in our information technology systems, infrastructure
and personnel, in certain cases with the assistance of strategic partners and
other third-party service providers. These investments involve replacing
existing systems, some of which are older, legacy systems that are less
flexible and efficient, with successor systems; outsourcing certain technology
and business processes to third-party service providers; making changes to
existing systems, including the migration of applications to the cloud;
maintaining or enhancing legacy systems that are not currently being replaced;
or designing or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality.
These efforts can result in significant potential risks, including failure of
the systems to operate as designed, potential loss or corruption of data,
failures in security processes and internal controls, cost overruns,
implementation delays or errors, disruption of operations, and the potential
inability to meet business and reporting requirements. Any system
implementation and transition difficulty may result in operational challenges,
security failures, reputational harm, and increased costs that could adversely
affect our business operations and results of operations.

Disruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our
interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences.

Through our information technology systems, we are able to provide an improved
overall shopping and interconnected experience that empowers our customers to
shop and interact with us from a variety of electronic devices and digital
platforms. We use our digital platforms as sales channels for our products and
services, as methods of providing inspiration, and as sources of product,
project, and other relevant information to our customers to help drive sales.
We also have multiple online communities, digital platforms, and knowledge
centers that allow us to inform, assist and interact with our customers. The
retail industry is continually evolving and expanding, with a significant
increase in sales initiated online and via mobile applications. We may not be
successful at managing this increased volume and related delivery options
without interruption in the future. Additionally, we must effectively respond
to new developments and changing customer preferences with respect to a
digital and interconnected experience. We continually seek to enhance all of
our online and digital properties to provide a personalized, user-friendly
interface for our customers. Disruptions, delays, failures or other
performance issues with our customer-facing technology systems, either due to
increased volume, system modifications, or other factors, or a failure of
these systems to meet our or our customers' expectations, could impair the
value they provide, adversely impact our sales, and negatively affect our
relationship with our customers.

Disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the availability
and distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business.

Disruption within our logistics or supply chain network, such as the industry-
wide supply chain challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, have in the
past and may in the future adversely affect our ability to receive and deliver
inventory in a timely manner, impair our ability to meet customer demand for
products, and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs, and/or
damage to our reputation. Such disruptions may result from damage or
destruction to our distribution or fulfillment centers or those of our supply
chain service providers; weather-related events; cybersecurity incidents or
attacks; natural disasters; international trade disputes, trade policy changes
or restrictions, or import- or export-related governmental sanctions or
restrictions; customs actions, including regulatory enforcement inquiries,
holds, detentions, and exclusions; quotas, tariffs or other import-related
taxes; strikes, lock-outs, work stoppages or slowdowns; shortages of supply
chain labor, including truck drivers; shipping capacity constraints, including
shortages of related equipment; raw material or other shortages; third-party
contract disputes or inability to maintain favorable contract terms; supply or
shipping interruptions or costs; increased costs or unavailability of fuel;
military conflicts or acts of war, as well as any related sanctions or other
government or private responses; acts of terrorism; public health issues,
including pandemics or quarantines (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and related
shut-downs, re-openings, or other actions by government regulators or others;
civil unrest; or other factors beyond our control. In recent years, ports in
the U.S. and elsewhere have been impacted by capacity constraints, port
congestion and delays, periodic labor disputes, security issues, weather-
related events, and natural disasters. Disruptions to our supply chain due to
any of the factors listed above could negatively impact our financial
performance or financial condition.

If our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of customer, associate,
job applicant, business partner, and Company information are not successful,
we could incur substantial costs and reputational damage and could become
subject to litigation and enforcement actions.

Our business, like that of most retailers, involves the collection,
processing, retention, management, transmission, and deletion of personal
information (including identifiers, internet activity, preferences, and
payment information) from our customers, associates, job applicants, and
business partners, as well as confidential Company information. We also work
with third-party service providers that provide technology, systems and
services that we use in connection with the handling of information. Our
information systems, and those of our third-party service providers, are
vulnerable to continually evolving data protection and cybersecurity risks.
Unauthorized parties have in the past gained access, and will continue to
attempt to gain access, to these systems and data through fraud or other means
of deceiving our associates or third-party service providers. Hardware,
software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain
exploitable vulnerabilities, bugs, or defects in design, maintenance or
manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information
security. We have experienced and continue to face the ongoing risk of
exploitation of our software providers and our software development and
implementation process, including from coding and process vulnerabilities and
the installation of so-called back doors that provide unauthorized access to
systems and data. The increased use of a remote workforce has also expanded
the possible attack surface areas. In addition, the risk of cyber-attacks has
increased in connection with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the resulting
geopolitical conflict. In light of this and other geopolitical events, nation-
state actors or their supporters may launch retaliatory cyber-attacks, and may
attempt to cause supply chain and other third-party service provider
disruptions, or take other geopolitically-motivated retaliatory actions that
may disrupt our

business operations, result in data compromise, or both. Nation-state actors
have in the past carried out, and may in the future carry out, cyber-attacks
to achieve their aims and goals, which may include espionage, monetary gain,
disruption, and destruction. To achieve their objectives, nation-state actors
and other cyber criminals have used and may continue to use numerous attack
vectors and methods, including use of stolen passwords, social engineering,
phishing, smishing, vishing, identity spoofing, ransomware or other disruptive
and destructive malware, supply chain compromises, and man-in-the-middle and
denial of service attacks. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access,
disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are constantly changing and
evolving, increasing in frequency and sophistication, and may be difficult to
anticipate or detect for long periods of time.

To protect against unauthorized access to or use of data, prevent data loss,
preserve data integrity, and protect our own access to systems, we have
implemented and regularly review and update systems, processes, and
procedures; third-party assessments and testing; and annual associate training
and other specific training initiatives. However, the ever-evolving threats
mean that we and our third-party service providers and business partners must
continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and
overall security environment, as well as those of companies we acquire. There
is no guarantee that the measures we take will be adequate to safeguard
against all threats, including vulnerabilities, data security breaches, system
compromises or misuses of data. As we saw in connection with the data breach
we experienced in 2014, any significant compromise or breach of our data
security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, associate, job
applicant, business partner, or Company data, could result in significant
costs, including costs to investigate and remediate, as well as lost sales,
fines, lawsuits, regulatory investigations, and damage to our reputation.
Furthermore, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access,
disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not
immediately produce signs of anomalous activity or compromise, we may be
unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative
measures. Additionally, as occurred in the case of the data breach we
experienced in 2014, we or our third-party service providers may not discover
any security breach, vulnerability or compromise of information for a
significant period of time after the occurrence of a security incident.

In addition, data governance failures can adversely affect our reputation and
business. Our business depends on our customers', associates', job applicants'
and business partners' willingness to entrust us with their personal
information. Events that adversely affect that trust, including inadequate
disclosure to our customers, associates, job applicants, or business partners
of our uses of their information or failing to keep our information technology
systems and our customers', associates', job applicants' and business
partners' personal information secure from significant attack, theft, damage,
loss or unauthorized disclosure or access, whether as a result of our action
or inaction (including human error or malfeasance) or that of our service
providers or other third parties, could adversely affect our brand and harm
our reputation. Further, the regulatory environment related to data privacy
and cybersecurity is constantly changing, with new and increasingly rigorous
requirements applicable to our business. The implementation of these
requirements has also become more complex. Maintaining our compliance with
evolving requirements, including state privacy laws, requires significant
effort and cost, requires changes to our business practices, and may limit our
ability to collect and use certain data to support the customer experience. In
addition, failure to comply with applicable requirements could subject us to
fines, sanctions, governmental investigations, lawsuits or reputational
damage. Additionally, our cyber insurance coverage may not be adequate for
liabilities or costs actually incurred, and we cannot be certain that
insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable
terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage of a future
claim.

We are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating
costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability, and
potentially disrupt our business.

We accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit and debit
cards, our private label credit cards, cash, checks, PayPal, installment loan
programs, trade credit, and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options
over time. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules,
regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including
payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and
certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers.
These requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted, making compliance
more difficult, costly, or uncertain. For certain payment methods, including
credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase
over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide
payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit
cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable
to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could
potentially disrupt our business. The payment methods that we offer, and the
selling channels in which we operate, also subject us to potential fraud and
theft by threat actors, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated,
seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist
in our sales, payments and payment processing systems. If we fail to comply
with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if
payment-related data is compromised

due to a breach or misuse of data, we may be liable for costs incurred by
payment card issuing banks and other third parties or we may be subject to
fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate
certain types of payments may be impaired. In addition, our customers could
lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a shift to other
payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in
higher costs. As a result, our business and operating results could be
adversely affected.

Our business is subject to seasonal influences, and uncharacteristic or
significant weather conditions, climate change, natural disasters, as well as
other catastrophic events, could impact our operations.

Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, fires, floods,
droughts or water scarcity, tornadoes, and earthquakes; unseasonable,
unexpected or extreme weather conditions, whether as a result of climate
change or otherwise; acts of terrorism or violence, including active shooter
situations; public health concerns, such as pandemics and quarantines and
related shut-downs, re-openings, or other actions by government regulators or
others; civil unrest; military conflicts or acts of war, as well as any
related sanctions or other government or private responses; or similar
disruptions and catastrophic events can affect consumer spending and
confidence and consumers' disposable income, particularly with respect to home
improvement or construction projects, and could have an adverse effect on our
financial performance. These types of events can also adversely affect our
work force and prevent associates and customers from reaching our stores and
other facilities. They can also, temporarily or on a long-term basis, disrupt
or disable operations of stores, support centers, and portions of our supply
chain and distribution network, including causing reductions in the
availability of inventory and disruption of utility services. In addition,
these events may affect our information systems and digital platforms,
resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our
ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders; to communicate with our
stores, facilities, store support centers or senior management; or to access
financial or banking systems. Unseasonable, unexpected or extreme weather
conditions such as excessive precipitation, warm temperatures during the
winter season, or prolonged or extreme periods of warm or cold temperatures,
could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with customer needs.

Furthermore, the long-term impacts of climate change, whether involving
physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions) or transition risks (such
as regulatory or technology changes) are expected to be widespread and
unpredictable. These changes over time could affect, for example, the
availability and cost of or demand for certain consumer products, commodities,
and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact our ability to
procure certain goods or services for the operation of our business at the
quantities and levels we consider optimal.

As a consequence of these or other catastrophic or uncharacteristic events, we
may experience interruption to our operations, increased costs, or losses of
property, equipment or inventory, which would adversely affect our revenue and
profitability.

If we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of
qualified suppliers, or if our suppliers experience financial difficulties or
other challenges, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that
meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected.

We buy our products from suppliers located around the world, who in turn
procure materials from across the globe. Our ability to continue to identify
and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high
standards for quality and responsible sourcing, as well as our need to access
products in a timely and efficient manner, is a significant challenge. Our
ability to access products from our suppliers can be adversely affected by
economic or political instability; civil unrest; military conflicts or acts of
war, as well as any related sanctions or other government or private
responses; acts of terrorism or violence; public health issues (including
pandemics and related impacts); the financial instability of suppliers;
suppliers' noncompliance with applicable laws; contract disputes or inability
to maintain favorable contract terms; trade restrictions; tariffs; currency
exchange rates; disruptions in our suppliers' logistics or supply chain
networks or information technology systems; inability to sell certain products
due to customs actions, including regulatory enforcement inquiries, holds,
detentions, and exclusions; raw material or other shortages; and other factors
beyond our or our suppliers' control. If we are unable to access products to
meet our customers' demands and expectations in a timely and efficient manner,
our sales and gross margin results may be adversely impacted.

Failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality
and safety and ensure compliance with responsible sourcing laws and standards
could damage our reputation with customers, expose us to litigation or

Product and service quality issues could negatively impact customer confidence
in our brands and our Company. If our product and service offerings do not
meet applicable product standards or our customers' expectations regarding
safety or quality, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be

and reputational risks, as well as governmental enforcement actions. Actual,
potential or perceived product safety concerns, including health-related
concerns, could expose us to litigation or government enforcement actions, and
could result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. We may not be
successful in obtaining adequate contractual indemnification and insurance
coverage from our suppliers and service providers, which may result in claims
having an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. Even with adequate insurance and indemnification, our reputation
as a provider of high-quality products and services, including both national
brand names and our proprietary products, could suffer, damaging our
reputation and impacting customer loyalty. In addition, we and our customers
have expectations around responsible sourcing, which is an increasing focus of
government regulators as well. All of our suppliers must comply with our
responsible sourcing standards, which cover a variety of expectations across
multiple areas of social compliance, including supply chain transparency,
health and safety, environmental laws and regulations, compensation, hours of
work, and prohibitions on child and forced labor. We have a responsible
sourcing audit process, but we are also dependent on our suppliers to ensure
that the products and services we provide to our customers comply with our
standards and applicable law. Actual, potential or perceived supplier non-
compliance could, and in certain instances in the past has, exposed us to
litigation or governmental enforcement actions or resulted in costly product
recalls; inability to sell certain products due to customs actions, including
regulatory enforcement inquiries, holds, detentions, and exclusions; and/or
other liabilities.

Our proprietary products subject us to certain increased risks, including
regulatory, product liability, intellectual property, supplier relations, and
reputational risks.

In addition to other product-related risks discussed in this section, as we
expand our proprietary product offerings, we may become subject to increased
risks due to our greater role in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale
of those products. The risks include greater responsibility to administer and
comply with applicable regulatory requirements, increased potential product
liability and product recall exposure, and increased potential reputational
risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products. To effectively
execute on our product differentiation strategy, we must also be able to
successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and
avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties. In addition,
an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adversely affect sales of
our suppliers' products, which in turn could adversely affect our
relationships with certain of our suppliers. Any failure to appropriately
address some or all of these risks could damage our reputation and have an
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial
condition.

If we are unable to effectively manage our installation services business, we
could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines, lawsuits, reputational damage
or the loss of our general contractor licenses.

We act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our DIFM
customers through professional third-party licensed and insured installers. As
such, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to
general contractors, which include management of background checks, licensing,
permitting, and handling of environmental risks, as well as quality of work
performed by our third-party installers. We have established processes and
procedures to manage these requirements and manage customer satisfaction with
the services provided by our third-party installers. However, as we
experienced in part with our recent EPA investigation and resulting consent
decree in April 2021, if we fail to manage these processes effectively,
collect the appropriate documentation, perform regular job site inspections,
or provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales,
fines, lawsuits, or governmental enforcement actions for violations of
regulatory requirements, as well as claims for property damage or personal
injury. In addition, we may suffer damage to our reputation or the loss of our
general contractor licenses, which could adversely affect our business.

LEGAL, FINANCIAL, REGULATORY, GLOBAL AND OTHER EXTERNAL RISKS

Uncertainty regarding the housing market, economic conditions, political and
social climate, public health issues, and other factors beyond our control
could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of
doing business, and our financial performance.

Our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the
housing and home improvement markets, as well as general economic conditions,
including changes in gross domestic product. Adverse conditions in or
uncertainty about these markets, the economy or the political or social
climate could adversely impact our customers' confidence or financial
condition, causing them to decide against purchasing home improvement products
and services, causing them to delay purchasing decisions, or impacting their
ability to pay for products and services. Other factors beyond our control -
including unemployment and foreclosure rates; inventory loss due to theft
(including as a result of organized retail crime); interest rate fluctuations;
inflation or deflation; fuel and other energy costs; raw material or other
shortages; labor and healthcare costs; the availability of financing; the
state of

the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer
credit; changes in tax rates and policy; weather and natural disasters
(including the potential impacts of climate change); acts of terrorism or
violence, including active shooter situations; public health issues, including
pandemics and related impacts; military conflicts or acts of war, as well as
any related sanctions or other government or private responses; and civil
unrest, could further adversely affect demand for our products and services,
our costs of doing business, and our financial performance. A number of
merchandise categories have been impacted by higher inflation than that which
we have experienced in recent years due to, among other things, the continuing
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chain disruptions, and the
uncertain economic and geopolitical environment. If inflation increases costs
beyond our ability to control our related costs, we may not be able to adjust
prices or use our portfolio strategy to sufficiently offset the effect without
negatively impacting consumer demand or our gross margin. Further, our MRO
customers, who have higher spend and longer-term relationships than a typical
retail customer, primarily use trade credit to finance their purchases, and
some of our Pros use trade credit in order to purchase our products. As a
result, their ability to pay is highly dependent on the economic strength of
the industry in their areas. If these customers are unable to repay the trade
credit from us, we may face greater default risk, which could reduce our cash
flow and adversely affect our results of operations.

Our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded
enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and
regulations.

We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that
govern numerous aspects of our business. In recent years, a number of new laws
and regulations have been adopted, there has been expanded enforcement of
certain existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies,
and the interpretation of certain laws and regulations has become increasingly
complex. These laws and regulations, and related interpretations and
enforcement activity, may change as a result of a variety of factors,
including political, economic or social events. Changes in, expanded
enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and
regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements; the
classification of exempt and non-exempt employees; the distinction between
employees and contractors; other wage, labor or workplace regulations;
healthcare; data privacy and cybersecurity; the sale, marketing, sourcing, and
pricing of some of our products; transportation, logistics and interstate
delivery operations, including Department of Transportation regulations on
vehicles and drivers; international trade; supply chain transparency; taxes,
including changes to corporate tax rates; restrictions on carbon dioxide and
other greenhouse gas emissions; competition and antitrust requirements; ESG
programs, transparency and reporting; unclaimed property; energy costs and
consumption; or hazardous waste disposal and other environmental matters,
including with respect to our installation services business, could increase
our costs of doing business or impact our sales, operations or profitability.

If we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by
international markets, we may not be successful in our international
operations and our sales and profitability may be negatively impacted.

Our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in, and source products
and materials from, international markets is affected by many of the same
risks we face in our U.S. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties
of managing international operations. Our international operations, including
any expansion in international markets, may be adversely affected by local
laws and customs, U.S. laws applicable to foreign operations and other foreign
legal and regulatory constraints, as well as political, social and economic
conditions. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among
others, potential adverse tax consequences; international trade disputes,
trade policy changes or potential tariffs and other import-related taxes and
controls; inability to sell certain products due to customs actions, including
regulatory enforcement inquiries, holds, detentions, and exclusions; greater
difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights; limitations on access to
ports; risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-
bribery law compliance; military conflicts or acts of war, as well as any
related sanctions or other government or private responses; compliance with
forced labor laws; and challenges in our ability to identify and gain access
to local suppliers. For example, trade tensions between the U.S. and China
have led to a series of significant tariffs on the importation of certain
product categories. As a portion of our retail products are sourced, directly
or indirectly, outside of the U.S., major changes in tax or trade policies,
tariffs or trade relations could adversely impact the cost of, demand for, and
profitability of retail product sales in our U.S. locations. Other countries
may also change their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in
response to increased import tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy
and regulations. In addition, our operations in international markets create
risk due to foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates,
which may adversely impact our sales and profitability.

The inflation or deflation of commodity and other prices could affect our
prices, demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins.

Prices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw
materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising
from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, inflationary
pressures, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government
regulations, tariffs and trade restrictions, natural disasters, geopolitical
conflicts, and periodic delays in delivery. For example, Russia's invasion of
Ukraine and the related international responses have exacerbated inflationary
pressures, including causing increases in commodity prices as well as fuel and
other energy costs. Rapid and significant changes in commodity and other
prices, such as changes in lumber prices, and our ability to pass them on to
our customers or manage them through our portfolio strategy, may affect the
demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. If product cost
inflation increases beyond our ability to control our related costs, we may
not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of the various
cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand.

The continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are highly unpredictable,
volatile, and uncertain, and could adversely affect our business operations,
demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business,
availability of labor, access to inventory, supply chain operations, our
ability to predict future performance, our exposure to litigation, and our
financial performance, among other things.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant public health concerns as well as
economic disruption, uncertainty, and volatility, all of which have impacted
our business. While we have taken numerous steps to mitigate the impact of the
pandemic on our results of operations, there can be no assurance that these
efforts will continue to be successful. While efforts to address the pandemic,
including vaccinations, have fostered progress and many restrictions have
relaxed, due to numerous uncertainties and factors beyond our control, we are
unable to predict the ongoing impact that the pandemic and recovery efforts
will have on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial
condition. These factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:

•the ongoing impact of COVID-19, including whether there are further "waves"
or other continued increases or spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases in
future periods in areas in which we or our suppliers operate, and the
potential for longer-term impact as COVID-19 becomes endemic;

•the rapidly changing and fluid circumstances caused by the pandemic and
efforts to contain and recover from it and our ability to respond quickly
enough or appropriately to those circumstances;

•the duration and degree of governmental, business or other actions in
response to the pandemic, including but not limited to quarantine or shut-down
measures and other governmental orders, or the termination of those measures;
fiscal policy changes; or additional measures that may yet be enacted;

•the health of, and longer-term effect of the pandemic on, our associates and
our ability to maintain staffing needs to effectively operate our business;

•changes in labor markets affecting us and our suppliers, including labor
shortages and increased employee turnover;

•evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty,
unemployment rates, inflation and deflation, rising interest rates, and
recessionary pressures, and their ongoing impact on consumer confidence,
economic well-being, spending, and shopping behaviors;

•impacts - financial, operational or otherwise - on our supply chain,
including on manufacturers or suppliers of our products and logistics or
transportation providers, and on our service providers, subcontractors, or
other business partners;

•the effects on our internal control environment and data security as a result
of the remote and hybrid work environment;

•the impact of regulatory and judicial changes in liability for workers'
compensation;

•potential increases in insurance premiums, medical claims costs, and workers'
compensation claims costs; and

•the impact of litigation or claims from customers, associates, suppliers,
regulators or other third parties relating to COVID-19 or our actions in
response thereto.

In addition, as the pandemic subsides, customers have shifted more of their
spending away from home improvement and back to other areas, compared to the
historic levels of home improvement spending we saw during the heights of the
pandemic, which may have an adverse impact on our sales.

The above factors and uncertainties, or others of which we are not currently
aware, may result in adverse impacts to our business, results of operations,
cash flows, and financial condition. In addition to the factors above, the

COVID-19 pandemic has increased a number of other risks to our business,
including but not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in these Risk
Factors:

Associate and Customer Safety-Related Risks. The health and safety of our
associates and customers are of primary concern to our management team. In
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took several steps to support our
associates, including expanding certain compensation and benefits to help
alleviate some of the challenges our associates were facing as a result of
COVID-19, and adopted a number of enhanced safety measures in our stores and
other facilities. We have transitioned from these temporary pay and benefits
programs, as well as many of the enhanced safety measures. However, due to the
unpredictable nature of COVID-19 and the consequences of our actions, we may
see unexpected outcomes from rolling back safety measures as conditions
evolve, particularly if there are further outbreaks. If we do not respond
appropriately to any further COVID-19 outbreaks, if our customers or
associates do not participate in safety measures, or if rolling back safety
measures results in additional outbreaks, the well-being of our associates and
customers could be at risk. Furthermore, any failure to appropriately respond,
or the perception of an inadequate response, could cause reputational harm to
our brand and/or subject us to claims and litigation from associates,
customers, suppliers, regulators or other third parties. Additionally, we have
faced, and may continue to face, periodic labor shortages at our stores due to
COVID-19 and other illnesses like influenza that were less prevalent during
the height of the pandemic, which can result in modifications to our
operations and negatively impact our business, costs and results of
operations.

Additionally, some jurisdictions have taken measures intended to expand the
availability of workers' compensation or to change the presumptions applicable
to workers compensation measures. These actions may increase our exposure to
workers' compensation claims and increase our cost of insurance.

Supply Chain-Related Risks. Circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic
significantly impacted the global supply chain, with restrictions and
limitations on business activities and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic
causing cost increases, labor shortages, capacity constraints, disruptions and
delays. These issues, which may continue or expand depending on the
progression of the pandemic, have placed strain on the domestic and
international supply chain, which has affected and may continue to negatively
affect the flow or availability of certain products. Even if we are able to
find alternate sources for certain products, they may cost more or require us
to incur higher transportation costs, which could adversely impact our
profitability and financial condition. Similarly, increased demand for online
purchases of products impacted our fulfillment operations, as well as those of
our third-party carriers, resulting in delays in delivering products to
customers. The operation of our distribution and fulfillment centers is
crucial to our business operations. We and our suppliers have experienced, and
may continue to experience, labor shortages at some of our distribution and
fulfillment centers, and any such labor shortages, whether temporary or
sustained, may adversely impact the flow or availability of products to our
stores and customers. Any of these circumstances could impair our ability to
meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply
chain costs, or damage to our reputation.

To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic and related recovery efforts continue to
adversely affect the U.S. and global economy and/or to adversely affect our
business, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition, they may
also heighten other risks described in this section and other SEC filings,
including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and
expectations, competition, brand and reputation, implementation of strategic
initiatives, cybersecurity threats, associate and customer privacy, technology
systems disruption, supply chain disruptions, labor availability and cost,
litigation, and regulatory requirements.

We may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance.

We are predominantly self-insured for a number of different risk categories,
such as general liability (including product liability), workers'
compensation, employee group medical, employment practices liability and wage
and hour claims, automobile claims, and network security and privacy
liability, with insurance coverage for certain catastrophic risks above the
self-insurance levels. The types and amounts of insurance may vary from time
to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory
requirements. The occurrence of significant claims, a substantial rise in
costs to maintain our insurance, the failure to maintain adequate insurance
coverage, or disputes with insurers regarding coverage could have an adverse
impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and
judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could
significantly affect our financial results or financial condition.

GAAP and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and
interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to
our business, such as asset impairment, inventories, lease obligations, self-
insurance, vendor allowances, tax matters, business combinations, and
litigation, are complex and involve many

subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in accounting
standards or their application or interpretation, or changes in underlying
assumptions, estimates or judgments, could significantly change our reported
or expected financial performance or financial condition. The implementation
of new accounting standards could also require certain systems, internal
process, internal controls, and other changes that could increase our
operating costs.

We are involved from time to time in a number of legal, regulatory and
governmental enforcement proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes
of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these
outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs.

We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and regulatory matters,
including government inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment,
tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course
of business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some
of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or
refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or
could result in excessive adverse verdicts, fines, or results. Additionally,
as we have seen in the past, involvement in these lawsuits, investigations and
inquiries, and other proceedings, as well as compliance with any settlements
or consent decrees that result from those proceedings, can involve significant
expense, divert management's attention and resources from other matters, and
impact the reputation of the Company.

Since April 19, 1984, our common stock has been listed on the NYSE, trading
under the symbol "HD." We paid our first cash dividend on June 22, 1987 and
have paid a cash dividend during each subsequent quarter. While we currently
expect a cash dividend to be paid in the future, future dividend payments will
depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other
factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors.

At March 1, 2023, there were approximately 110,000 holders of record of our
common stock and approximately 4,938,000 additional "street name" holders
whose shares are held of record by banks, brokers, and other financial
institutions.

(1)These amounts include repurchases pursuant to our Omnibus Stock Incentive
Plan, as Amended and Restated May 19, 2022, and our 1997 Omnibus Stock
Incentive Plan (collectively, the "Plans"). Under the Plans, participants may
surrender shares as payment of applicable tax withholding on the vesting of
restricted stock. Participants in the Plans may also exercise stock options by
surrendering shares of common stock that the participants already own as
payment of the exercise price. Shares so surrendered by participants in the
Plans are repurchased pursuant to the terms of the Plans and applicable award
agreement and not pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs.

(2)On August 18, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a $15.0 billion share
repurchase authorization that replaced the previous authorization of $20.0
billion, which was approved on May 20, 2021. This new authorization does not
have a prescribed expiration date.

SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we issued 483 deferred stock units
under the Home Depot, Inc. Nonemployee Directors' Deferred Stock Compensation
Plan pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2)
of the Securities Act and Rule 506 of the SEC's Regulation D thereunder. The
deferred stock units were credited during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 to
the accounts of those non-employee directors who elected to receive all or a
portion of board retainers in the form of deferred stock units instead of
cash. The deferred stock units convert to shares of common stock on a one-for-
one basis following a termination of service as described in this plan.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we credited 923 deferred stock units
to participant accounts under the Restoration Plans pursuant to an exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act for involuntary, non-
contributory plans. The deferred stock units convert to shares of common stock
on a one-for-one basis following a termination of service as described in
these plans.

We reported net sales of $157.4 billion in fiscal 2022. Net earnings were
$17.1 billion, or $16.69 per diluted share. During fiscal 2022, we opened two
new stores in the U.S. and four new stores in Mexico, and we lost one store in
the U.S. due to a fire, resulting in a total store count of 2,322 at January
29, 2023. At the end of fiscal 2022, a total of 315 of our stores, or 13.6% of
our total store count, were located in Canada and Mexico. Total sales per
retail square foot were $627.17 in fiscal 2022. Our inventory turnover ratio
was 4.2 times at the end of fiscal 2022, compared to 5.2 times at the end of
fiscal 2021. The decrease in our inventory turnover ratio was driven by an
increase in average inventory levels during fiscal 2022 resulting from
strategic investments to promote higher in-stock levels and pull forward
merchandise in response to ongoing global supply chain disruption, as well as
continued investment in our new supply chain facilities and carryover of some
spring seasonal inventory.

We generated $14.6 billion of cash flow from operations and issued $6.9
billion of long-term debt, net of discounts, during fiscal 2022. This cash
flow, together with cash on hand, was used to fund cash payments of $7.8
billion for dividends and $6.7 billion for share repurchases. In addition, we
repaid $2.5 billion of long-term debt and $1.0 billion of net short-term debt
and funded $3.1 billion in capital expenditures during fiscal 2022. In
February 2023, we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to
$2.09 per share.

Our ROIC was 44.6% for fiscal 2022 and 44.7% for fiscal 2021. See the Non-GAAP
Financial Measures section below for our definition and calculation of ROIC,
as well as a reconciliation of NOPAT, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net
earnings (the most comparable GAAP financial measure).

FISCAL 2022 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2021

Sales

We assess our sales performance by evaluating both net sales and comparable
sales.

Net Sales. Net sales for fiscal 2022 increased $6.2 billion, or 4.1%, to
$157.4 billion. The increase in net sales for fiscal 2022 primarily reflected
the impact of positive comparable sales driven by an increase in comparable
average ticket, partially offset by a decrease in comparable customer
transactions. A stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by $339
million in fiscal 2022.

Table of Contents

Online sales, which consist of sales generated online through our websites and
mobile applications for products picked up at our stores or delivered to
customer locations, represented 14.2% of net sales and grew by 7.4% during
fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. The increase in online sales in fiscal
2022 was a result of customers continuing to leverage our digital platforms
and reflects our ongoing investments to enhance these platforms and related
fulfillment capabilities, which support our interconnected retail strategy.

Comparable Sales. Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the
performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in
net sales for a period over the comparable prior-period of equivalent length.
Comparable sales includes sales at all locations, physical and online, open
greater than 52 weeks (including remodels and relocations) and excludes closed
stores. Retail stores become comparable on the Monday following their 52nd
week of operation. Acquisitions are typically included in comparable sales
after they have been owned for more than 52 weeks. Comparable sales is
intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net
sales presented in accordance with GAAP.

Total comparable sales increased 3.1% in fiscal 2022, reflecting an 8.8%
increase in comparable average ticket, partially offset by a 5.4% decrease in
comparable customer transactions compared to fiscal 2021. The increase in
comparable average ticket was primarily driven by inflation, as well as demand
for new and innovative products. The decrease in comparable customer
transactions reflects the impact of macroeconomic factors during fiscal 2022,
including indications of price sensitivity to the broader inflationary
environment and a gradual shift in consumer spending from goods back to
services, resulting in transactions trending towards fiscal 2019, pre-COVID-19
pandemic levels.

For fiscal 2022, 10 of our 14 merchandising departments posted positive
comparable sales, led by Building Materials, Plumbing, Millwork, Paint,
Hardware, and Kitchen and Bath, which posted comparable sales above the
Company average. Our Indoor Garden, Outdoor Garden, Appliances, and Flooring
departments posted negative comparable sales.

Gross Profit

Gross profit increased $1.9 billion, or 3.8%, to $52.8 billion in fiscal 2022.
Gross profit as a percent of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 33.5% in
fiscal 2022 compared to 33.6% in fiscal 2021. The decrease in gross profit
margin was primarily driven by higher product and transportation costs,
pressure from shrink during the second half of the year, and investments in
our supply chain network, offset by the benefit from higher retail prices,
along with favorable product mix.

Operating Expenses

Our operating expenses are composed of SG&A and depreciation and amortization.

Selling, General & Administrative. SG&A increased $878 million, or 3.5%, to
$26.3 billion in fiscal 2022. As a percent of net sales, SG&A was 16.7% in
fiscal 2022 compared to 16.8% in fiscal 2021, primarily reflecting leverage
from a positive comparable sales environment and lower incentive compensation,
partially offset by wage investments for hourly associates and increased
operational costs, including planned investments designed to drive
efficiencies in our stores.

Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased $69
million, or 2.9%, to $2.5 billion in fiscal 2022\. As a percent of net sales,
depreciation and amortization was 1.6% in both fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021,
reflecting leverage from a positive comparable sales environment, offset by
increased depreciation expense from strategic investments in the business.

Interest and Other, net

Interest and other, net increased $259 million, or 19.9%, to $1.6 billion in
fiscal 2022\. As a percent of net sales, interest and other, net, was 1.0% in
fiscal 2022 compared to 0.9% in fiscal 2021, primarily reflecting higher
interest expense due to higher debt balances and increased variable rate
interest on floating rate debt resulting from interest rate swaps, partially
offset by leverage from a positive comparable sales environment.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our combined effective income tax rate was 23.9% in fiscal 2022 compared to
24.4% in fiscal 2021\. The decrease in our effective income tax rate in fiscal
2022 was driven by certain discrete tax benefits recognized in fiscal 2022.

Diluted Earnings per Share

Diluted earnings per share were $16.69 in fiscal 2022 compared to $15.53 in
fiscal 2021\. The increase in diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2022 was
primarily driven by higher net earnings during fiscal 2022, as well as lower
diluted shares due to share repurchases.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

To provide clarity on our operating performance, we supplement our reporting
with certain non-GAAP financial measures. However, this supplemental
information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the
related GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may differ
from similar measures used by other companies.

Return on Invested Capital

We believe ROIC is meaningful for investors and management because it measures
how effectively we deploy our capital base. We define ROIC as NOPAT, a non-
GAAP financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by
average debt and equity. We define average debt and equity as the average of
beginning and ending long-term debt (including current installments) and
equity for the most recent twelve-month period.

The following table presents the calculation of ROIC, together with a
reconciliation of NOPAT to net earnings (the most comparable GAAP measure):

----------

(1)Income tax adjustment is defined as operating income multiplied by our
effective tax rate for the trailing twelve months.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

At January 29, 2023, we had $2.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of
which $825 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We believe that our
current cash position, cash flow generated from operations, funds available
from our commercial paper program, and access to the long-term debt capital
markets should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements, any
required debt payments, and satisfaction of other contractual obligations, but
also to enable us to invest in the business, fund dividend payments, and fund
any share repurchases through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we
believe we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing, if
necessary.

Our material cash requirements include contractual and other obligations
arising in the normal course of business. These obligations primarily include
long-term debt and related interest payments, operating and finance lease
obligations, and purchase obligations. In addition to our cash requirements,
we follow a disciplined approach to capital allocation. This approach first
prioritizes investing in the business, followed by paying dividends, with the
intent of then returning excess cash to shareholders in the form of share
repurchases. For fiscal 2023, we plan to invest approximately $3 billion back
into our business in the form of capital expenditures, in line with our
expectation of approximately two percent of net sales on an annual basis.
However, we may adjust our capital expenditures to support the operations of
the business, to enhance long-term strategic positioning, or in response to
the economic environment, as necessary or appropriate. Capital expenditures
were $3.1 billion in fiscal 2022.

Table of Contents

During fiscal 2022, we paid cash dividends of $7.8 billion to shareholders. In
February 2023, we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from
$1.90 to $2.09 per share. We intend to pay a dividend in the future; however,
any future dividend is subject to declaration by the Board of Directors based
on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other factors
considered relevant by our Board of Directors.

In August 2022, our Board of Directors approved a $15.0 billion share
repurchase authorization that replaced the previous authorization of $20.0
billion, which was approved in May 2021. This new authorization does not have
a prescribed expiration date. As of January 29, 2023, approximately $12.5
billion of the $15.0 billion share repurchase authorization remained
available. During fiscal 2022, we had cash payments of $6.7 billion for
repurchases of our common stock through open market purchases.

DEBT

In July 2022, we expanded our commercial paper program from $3.0 billion to
$5.0 billion to further enhance our financial flexibility. All of our short-
term borrowings in fiscal 2022 were under our commercial paper program, and
the maximum amount outstanding at any time was $2.7 billion. In connection
with our program, we have back-up credit facilities with a consortium of
banks. In July 2022, we also expanded the borrowing capacity under these back-
up facilities from $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion by entering into a five-year
$3.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2027 and a 364-day
$1.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2023. These
facilities replaced our previously existing five-year $2.0 billion credit
facility, which was scheduled to expire in December 2023, and our 364-day $1.0
billion credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in December 2022. At
January 29, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding under our commercial
paper program, and we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained
in our credit facilities, none of which are expected to impact our liquidity
or capital resources.

We also issue senior notes from time to time as part of our capital management
strategy. In March 2022, we issued $4.0 billion of senior notes. The net
proceeds from this issuance were used for general corporate purposes,
including repayment of outstanding indebtedness and repurchases of shares of
our common stock. In September 2022, we issued an additional $3.0 billion of
senior notes. The net proceeds from this issuance were used for general
corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of our common stock.
During fiscal 2022, we repaid $2.25 billion of senior notes. At January 29,
2023, we had an aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding of
$41.2 billion, with $1.0 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest
payments associated with these senior notes total $24.9 billion, with $1.7
billion payable within 12 months, based on current interest rates, which
include the impact of our active interest rate swap agreements.

The indentures governing our senior notes do not generally limit our ability
to incur additional indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or
specified levels of net worth or liquidity. The indentures governing the notes
contain various customary covenants; however, none are expected to impact our
liquidity or capital resources. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial
statements for further discussion of our debt arrangements.

LEASES

We use operating and finance leases largely to fund a portion of our real
estate, including our stores, distribution centers, and store support centers.
At January 29, 2023, we had aggregate lease obligations of $14.7 billion, with
$1.5 billion payable within 12 months. Aggregate lease obligations include
$2.1 billion of obligations related to leases not yet commenced. See Note 3 to
our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our operating
and finance leases.

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER

Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm
commitments for inventory purchases, media and sponsorship spend, software and
license commitments, and legally binding service contracts. We issue inventory
purchase orders in the ordinary course of business, which are typically
cancellable by their terms, therefore we do not consider purchase orders that
are cancellable to be firm inventory commitments. At January 29, 2023, we had
aggregate purchase obligations of $1.8 billion, with $947 million payable
within 12 months.

At January 29, 2023, we had aggregate liabilities for unrecognized tax
benefits totaling $643 million, none of which are expected to be paid in the
next 12 months. The timing of payment, if any, associated with our long-term
unrecognized tax benefit liabilities is unknown. See Note 5 to our
consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our unrecognized
tax benefits.

We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements.

CASH FLOWS SUMMARY

![hd-20230129_g5.jpg](hd-20230129_g5.jpg)

Operating Activities

Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of
liquidity. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from
our customers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services,
associate compensation, operations, occupancy costs, and income taxes. Cash
provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in
working capital. Working capital at any point in time is subject to many
variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion,
the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $2.0 billion in fiscal
2022 compared to fiscal 2021, primarily driven by changes in working capital,
slightly offset by an increase in net earnings. Changes in working capital
were driven by inventory management actions and the related timing of vendor
payments. These inventory management actions, which began in fiscal 2021 and
moderated during the second half of fiscal 2022, reflect strategic investments
in inventory to support the demand environment, promote higher in-stock
levels, and pull forward merchandise for seasonal events in response to global
supply chain disruption, as well as investments in our new supply chain
facilities.

Investing Activities

Cash used in investing activities increased by $171 million in fiscal 2022
compared to fiscal 2021, primarily resulting from increased capital
expenditures, partially offset by cash paid for an acquired business during
fiscal 2021.

Financing Activities

Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2022 primarily reflected $7.8
billion of cash dividends paid, $6.7 billion of share repurchases, $2.5
billion of repayments of long-term debt, and $1.0 billion of net repayments of
short-term debt, partially offset by $6.9 billion of net proceeds from long-
term debt.

Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 primarily reflected $14.8
billion of share repurchases, $7.0 billion of cash dividends paid, and $1.5
billion of repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by $3.0 billion of
net proceeds from long-term debt and $1.0 billion of net proceeds from short-
term debt. Fiscal 2021 reflected elevated share repurchase activity following
the temporary suspension of repurchases during fiscal 2020 in order to enhance
our liquidity position at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with
GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our
consolidated financial statements. The following discussion addresses our most
critical accounting estimates, which are those that are both important to the
representation of our financial condition and results of operations, and that
require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex
estimates.

MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES

We value the majority of our inventory under the retail inventory method,
using the first-in, first-out method, with the remainder of our inventories
valued under a cost method. Under the retail inventory method, inventories are
stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the
retail value of inventories.

The retail value of our inventory is adjusted as needed to reflect current
market conditions. Because these adjustments are based on current prevailing
market conditions, the value of our inventory approximates the lower of cost
or market. The valuation under the retail inventory method is based on a
number of factors such as markups, markdowns, and inventory losses (or
shrink). As such, there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final
determination of inventory cost and gross profit. We determine markups and
markdowns based on the consideration of a variety of factors such as current
and anticipated demand, customer preferences and buying trends, age of the
merchandise, and weather conditions.

We calculate shrink based on actual inventory losses identified as a result of
physical inventory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inventory
losses between physical inventory counts. The estimate for shrink occurring in
the interim period between physical inventory counts is calculated on a store-
specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results. A 10% increase
in the shrink rate used to estimate our inventory shrink reserve would have
increased cost of sales by approximately $113 million for fiscal 2022.
Historically, the difference between estimated shrink and actual inventory
losses has not been material to our annual financial results.

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood for a material change in
the estimates or assumptions we use to value our inventory under the retail
inventory method. We believe that the retail inventory method provides an
inventory valuation which approximates cost and results in valuing our
inventory at the lower of cost or market.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

For information on our accounting policies and on accounting pronouncements
that have impacted or are expected to materially impact our financial
condition, results of operations, or cash flows, see Note 1 to our
consolidated financial statements.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

INTEREST RATE RISK

We have exposure to interest rate risk in connection with our long-term debt
portfolio. We use interest rate swap agreements to manage our fixed/floating-
rate debt portfolio, none of which are for trading or speculative purposes. At
January 29, 2023, after giving consideration to our interest rate swap
agreements, floating-rate debt principal was $5.4 billion, or approximately
13% of our senior notes portfolio. Our interest rate swap agreements were in
an aggregate liability position of $778 million at January 29, 2023. The
changes in the fair values of our interest rate swap agreements offset the
changes in the fair value of the hedged long-term debt. Based on our January
29, 2023 floating-rate debt principal, a one percentage point increase in the
interest rate of floating-rate debt would increase our annual interest expense
by approximately $54 million.

The United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority announced the phased
cessation of publication of LIBOR beginning after 2021 and continuing through
2023. While the discontinuance of LIBOR tenors that are scheduled to occur in
2023 will impact our interest rate swaps, we do not anticipate the transition
to a new reference rate will have a material impact on our consolidated
financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK

We are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on
the translation of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars and on the
purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in
their local currencies. We use derivative instruments to hedge a portion of
our foreign currency exchange rate risk, none of which are for trading or
speculative purposes. Our foreign currency related hedging arrangements
outstanding at the end of fiscal 2022 were not material.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

We experience inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain
commodity products. This price volatility could potentially have a material
impact on our financial condition and/or our results of operations. In order
to mitigate price volatility, we monitor commodity price fluctuations and may
adjust our selling prices accordingly; however, our ability to recover higher
costs through increased pricing may be limited by the competitive environment
in which we operate. We currently do not use derivative instruments to manage
these risks.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors

The Home Depot, Inc.:

  

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Home
Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of January 29, 2023 and January
30, 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive
income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in
the three-year period ended January 29, 2023, and the related notes
(collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company as of January 29, 2023 and January 30,
2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 29, 2023, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023, based on criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our
report dated March 15, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent
with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included
performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the
consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in
the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the
current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that:
(1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated
financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective,
or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not
alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken
as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,
providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts
or disclosures to which it relates.

  

Estimation of store shrink

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the majority
of the Company's U.S. merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost
(first-in, first out) or market as determined by the retail inventory method,
which is based on a number of factors such as markups, markdowns, and
inventory losses (or shrink). Shrink is the difference between the recorded
amount of inventory and the physical inventory count. The Company calculates
shrink based on actual inventory losses identified as a result of physical
inventory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inventory losses
between physical inventory counts. The estimate for shrink occurring in the
interim period between physical inventory counts is calculated on a store-
specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results.

We identified the evaluation of the estimation of store shrink occurring in
the period between physical inventory counts and fiscal year-end as a critical
audit matter. Evaluating the Company's estimation of shrink at the end of the
fiscal year using interim inventory loss experience in U.S. retail stores
involved auditor judgment.

Table of Contents

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical
audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness
of certain internal controls related to the process of developing the estimate
of store shrink. We evaluated the appropriateness of the Company using interim
physical inventory counts to estimate inventory losses in U.S. retail stores
at the end of the fiscal year by:

•Evaluating the method and certain assumptions used;

•Testing the application of the method and certain assumptions used;

•Performing a current year trend analysis; and

•Performing a sensitivity analysis over the shrink reserve estimate.

THE HOME DEPOT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business

The Home Depot, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (the "Company," "Home
Depot," "we," "our" or "us"), is a home improvement retailer that sells a wide
assortment of building materials, home improvement products, lawn and garden
products, decor items, and facilities maintenance, repair and operations
products, in stores and online. We also provide a number of services,
including home improvement installation services and tool and equipment
rental. We operate in the U.S. (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and
the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam), Canada, and Mexico.

Consolidation and Presentation

Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our
wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions are
eliminated in consolidation. Our fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period ending
on the Sunday nearest to January 31st. All periods presented include 52 weeks.

Use of Estimates

We have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting
of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses in preparing these
financial statements in conformity with GAAP. While we believe these estimates
and assumptions are reasonable, actual results could differ from these
estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and highly liquid
investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less.

Receivables, net

The following table presents components of receivables, net:

| | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
in millions| January 29,  
2023| | January 30,  
2022  
Card receivables| $| 1,003 | | | $| 1,028 |  
Rebate receivables| 948 | | | 1,170 |  
Customer receivables| 871 | | | 703 |  
Other receivables| 495 | | | 525 |  
Receivables, net| $| 3,317 | | | $| 3,426 |  
  
Card receivables consist of payments due from financial institutions for the
settlement of credit card and debit card transactions. Rebate receivables
represent amounts due from vendors for volume and co-op advertising rebates.
Customer receivables relate to credit extended directly to certain customers
in the ordinary course of business. The valuation allowance related to these
receivables was not material to our consolidated financial statements at the
end of fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021.

Merchandise Inventories

Inventory cost includes the amount we pay to acquire inventory, including
freight and import costs, as well as operating costs and depreciation
associated with our sourcing and distribution network, and is net of certain
vendor allowances. The majority of our merchandise inventories are stated at
the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, as determined by the retail
inventory method, which is based on a number of factors such as markups,
markdowns, and inventory losses (or shrink). As the inventory retail value is
adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, inventory valued using the
retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. Certain subsidiaries,
including retail operations in Canada and Mexico, and distribution centers,
record merchandise inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value,
as determined by a cost method. These merchandise inventories represent
approximately 42% of the total merchandise inventories balance. We evaluate
the inventory valued using a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure
that it is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the
adjustments recorded to merchandise inventories valued under a cost method
were not material to our consolidated financial statements at the end of
fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021.

Table of Contents

Physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each
store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in merchandise
inventories are properly stated. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory,
swell) is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the
physical inventory count. We calculate shrink based on actual inventory losses
identified as a result of physical inventory counts during each fiscal period
and estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts. The estimate
for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inventory counts
is calculated on a store-specific basis and is primarily based on recent
shrink results. Historically, the difference between estimated shrink and
actual inventory losses has not been material to our annual financial results.

Property and Equipment

Buildings and related improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment are
recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their
estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements and assets held under finance
leases are amortized using the straight-line method over the original term of
the lease or the useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter.

The following table presents the estimated useful lives of our property and
equipment:

| | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
| Life  
Buildings and improvements|

5 - 45 years  
  
Furniture, fixtures and equipment|

2 - 20 years  
  
Leasehold improvements|

5 - 45 years  
  
We capitalize certain costs, including interest, related to construction in
progress and the acquisition and development of software. Costs associated
with the acquisition and development of software are amortized using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which
ranges from three to seven years. Certain development costs not meeting the
criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred.

We evaluate our long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential
impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined
with a history of losses, our decision to relocate or close a store or other
location before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or when
changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the
lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual
store level. The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated
for recoverability by comparing their undiscounted future cash flows with
their carrying value. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted
future cash flows, we then measure the asset group's fair value to determine
whether an impairment loss should be recognized. If the resulting fair value
is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the
difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value. Impairment
losses on property and equipment are recorded as a component of SG&A.
Impairment charges for long-lived assets were not material to our consolidated
financial statements in fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, or fiscal 2020.

Leases

We enter into contractual arrangements for the utilization of certain non-
owned assets which are evaluated as finance or operating leases upon
commencement, and are accounted for accordingly. Specifically, a contract is
or contains a lease when (1) the contract contains an explicitly or implicitly
identified asset and (2) we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits
from the use of that underlying asset and direct how and for what purpose the
asset is used during the term of the contract in exchange for consideration.
We assess whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception of the
contract.

Our leases include certain retail locations, warehouse and distribution space,
office space, equipment, and vehicles. A substantial majority of our leases
have remaining lease terms of one to 20 years. Our real estate leases
typically provide the option to extend the lease for five-year terms, and some
of our leases may include the option to terminate in less than five years. The
lease term used to calculate the right-of-use asset and lease liability at
commencement includes the impacts of options to extend or terminate the lease
when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. When
determining whether it is reasonably certain that we will exercise an option
at commencement, we consider various existing economic factors, including
market conditions, real estate strategies, the nature, length, and terms of
the agreement, as well as the uncertainty of the condition of leased equipment
at the end of the lease term. Based on these determinations, we generally
conclude that the exercise of renewal options would not be reasonably certain
in determining the lease term at commencement.

Table of Contents

The discount rate used to calculate the present value of lease payments is the
rate implicit in the lease, when readily determinable. As the rate implicit in
the lease is rarely readily determinable, we use a secured incremental
borrowing rate, which is updated on a quarterly basis, as the discount rate
for the present value of lease payments.

Real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance, and operating expenses applicable
to the leased asset are generally our obligations under our lease agreements.
In instances where these payments are fixed, they are included in the
measurement of our lease liabilities, and when variable, are excluded and
recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is
incurred. Certain of our lease agreements also include rental payments based
on an index or rate and others include rental payments based on a percentage
of sales. For variable payments dependent upon an index or rate, we apply the
active index or rate as of the lease commencement date. Variable lease
payments not based on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of
our lease liabilities as they cannot be reasonably estimated, and are
recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is
incurred.

Leases that have a term of twelve months or less upon commencement are
considered short-term in nature. Short-term leases are not included on the
consolidated balance sheets and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the
lease term. We have also elected to not separate lease and non-lease
components for certain classes of assets including real estate and certain
equipment.

Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or
material restrictive covenants.

Business Combinations

The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded at their fair
values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the
fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is
recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which is up to one year
from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon
conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded
to earnings.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net
assets acquired. We do not amortize goodwill, but assess the recoverability of
goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators
warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports
its carrying value. Each fiscal year, we may assess qualitative factors to
determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each
reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining
whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments, with
a quantitative assessment completed as facts and circumstances warrant. We
completed our last quantitative assessment in fiscal 2019 and concluded that
the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective
carrying values, including goodwill.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we completed our annual assessment of
the recoverability of goodwill for our U.S., Canada, and Mexico reporting
units based on qualitative factors. We performed a qualitative assessment to
determine if there were any indicators of impairment and concluded that while
there have been events and circumstances in the macro-environment that have
impacted us, we have not experienced any entity-specific indicators that would
indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our
reporting units were less than their carrying amounts. There were no
impairment charges related to goodwill for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, or fiscal
2020.

The following table presents the changes in the carrying amount of our
goodwill:

Other Intangible Assets

Intangible assets other than goodwill are included in other assets on the
consolidated balance sheets. We amortize the cost of definite-lived intangible
assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range
up to 20 years, as this approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.
Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of
each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. During
the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we completed our annual assessment of the
recoverability of our indefinite-lived intangible assets based on quantitative
factors and concluded no impairment losses should be recognized. There were no
impairment losses related to intangible assets for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021,
and fiscal 2020.

The following table presents information regarding our intangible assets:

Debt

We record any premiums or discounts associated with an issuance of long-term
debt as a direct addition or deduction to the carrying value of the related
senior notes. We also record debt issuance costs associated with an issuance
of long-term debt as a direct deduction to the carrying value of the related
senior notes. Premium, discount, and debt issuance costs are amortized over
the term of the respective notes using the effective interest rate method.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

We use derivative instruments in the management of our interest rate exposure
on long-term debt and our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. We enter
into derivative instruments for risk management purposes only; we do not enter
into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. All
derivative instruments are recognized at their fair values in either assets or
liabilities at the balance sheet date and are classified as either current or
non-current based on each contract's respective maturity. While we enter into
master netting arrangements, our policy is to present the fair value of
derivative instruments on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets.

Changes in the fair values for derivative instruments designated as cash flow
or net investment hedges are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings, which for net
investment hedges is upon sale or substantial liquidation of the underlying
net investment. Changes in fair value of outstanding fair value hedges and the
offsetting changes in fair values of the hedged item are

recognized in earnings. We record realized gains and losses from derivative
instruments in the same financial statement line item as the hedged item.

Derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, if any, are recorded
at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings each period
in the same financial statement line item as the hedged item. Cash flows from
the settlement of derivative instruments appear in the consolidated statements
of cash flows in the same categories as the cash flows of the hedged item.

Self-Insurance Reserves

We are self-insured for certain losses related to general liability (including
product liability), workers' compensation, employee group medical, and
automobile claims. We recognize the expected ultimate cost for claims incurred
(undiscounted) at the balance sheet date as a liability. The expected ultimate
cost for claims incurred is estimated based upon analysis of historical data
and actuarial estimates. Our self-insurance liabilities, which are included in
accrued salaries and related expenses, other accrued expenses and other long-
term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, were $1.3 billion at both
January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022.

We also maintain network security and privacy liability insurance coverage to
limit our exposure to losses such as those that may be caused by a significant
compromise or breach of our data security.

Treasury Stock

Treasury stock is reflected as a reduction of stockholders' equity at cost. We
use the weighted average purchase cost to determine the cost of treasury stock
that is reissued, if any.

Net Sales

We recognize revenue, net of expected returns and sales tax, at the time the
customer takes possession of merchandise or when a service is performed. Our
liability for sales returns is estimated based on historical return levels and
our expectation of future returns. We also recognize a return asset, and
corresponding adjustment to cost of sales, for our right to recover the goods
returned by the customer, measured at the former carrying amount of the goods,
less any expected recovery cost. At each financial reporting date, we assess
our estimates of expected returns, refund liabilities, and return assets.
Adjustments related to changes in return estimates were immaterial in fiscal
2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020.

Services revenue is generated through a variety of installation, home
maintenance, and professional service programs. In these programs, the
customer selects and purchases material for a project, and we provide or
arrange for professional installation. These programs are offered through our
stores, online, and in-home sales programs. Under certain programs, when we
provide or arrange for the installation of a project and the subcontractor
provides material as part of the installation, both the material and labor are
included in services revenue. We recognize services revenue when the service
for the customer is complete, which is not materially different from
recognizing the revenue over the service period as the substantial majority of
our services are completed within one week.

For products and services sold in stores or online, payment is typically due
at the point of sale. When we receive payment from customers before the
customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been
performed, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue until the sale
or service is complete. Such performance obligations are part of contracts
with expected original durations of typically three months or less. As of
January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, deferred revenue for products and
services was $2.0 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively.

We further record deferred revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize
the associated revenue upon the redemption of those gift cards, which
generally occurs within six months of gift card issuance. As of January 29,
2023 and January 30, 2022, our performance obligations for unredeemed gift
cards were $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. Gift card breakage
income, which is our estimate of the portion of our gift card balance not
expected to be redeemed, is recognized in net sales and was immaterial in
fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020.

We also have agreements with third-party service providers who directly extend
credit to customers, manage our PLCC program, and own the related receivables.
We have evaluated the third-party entities holding the receivables under the
program and concluded that they should not be consolidated. The agreement with
the primary third-party service provider for our PLCC program expires in 2028,
with us having the option, but no obligation, to purchase the existing
receivables at the end of the agreement. Deferred interest charges incurred
for our deferred financing programs offered to these customers, interchange
fees charged to us for their use of the cards, and any profit sharing with the
third-party service providers are included in net sales.

Table of Contents

Cost of Sales

Cost of sales includes the actual cost of merchandise sold and services
performed; the cost of transportation of merchandise from vendors to our
distribution network, stores, or customers; shipping and handling costs from
our stores or distribution network to customers; and the operating cost and
depreciation of our sourcing and distribution network. Vendor allowances that
are not reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs are
also included within cost of sales.

Vendor Allowances

Vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a
result of attaining certain purchase levels and co-op advertising allowances
for the promotion of vendors' products that are typically based on guaranteed
minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain
purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those
allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued
over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. Volume rebates and
certain co-op advertising allowances reduce the carrying cost of inventory and
are recognized in cost of sales when the related inventory is sold.

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative expenses include compensation and benefits
for retail and store support center associates, occupancy and operating costs
of retail locations and store support centers, insurance-related expenses,
advertising costs, credit and debit card processing fees, and other
administrative costs.

Advertising Expense

Advertising costs, including digital, television, radio and print, are
expensed when the advertisement first appears. Certain co-op advertising
allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable
costs incurred to promote vendors' products are recorded as an offset against
advertising expense.

The following table presents net advertising expense included in SG&A:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

Net advertising expense| $| 1,085 | | | $| 1,044 | | | $| 909 |  
  
Stock-Based Compensation

We are currently authorized to issue incentive and nonqualified stock options,
stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units,
performance shares, performance units, and deferred shares to certain of our
associates and non-employee directors under certain stock incentive plans. We
measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards
made to associates and non-employee directors based on estimated fair values.
The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is
recognized as stock-based compensation expense, on a straight-line basis, over
the requisite service period or as restrictions lapse. We include estimated
forfeitures expected to occur when calculating stock-based compensation
expense. Additional information on our stock-based payment awards is included
in Note 8.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. We
provide for federal, state, and foreign income taxes currently payable, as
well as for those deferred due to timing differences between reporting income
and expenses for financial statement purposes versus tax purposes. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax
rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a
change in income tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period
that includes the enactment date. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of
realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation
allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that it is more
likely than not that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized.

We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are
more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are
measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being
realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in
which the change in judgment occurs.

Table of Contents

We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return which includes certain
eligible subsidiaries. Non-U.S. subsidiaries and certain U.S. subsidiaries,
which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, are not eligible to
be included in our consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Separate
provisions for income taxes have been determined for these entities. For
unremitted earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, we are required to make an
assertion regarding reinvestment or repatriation for tax purposes. For any
earnings that we do not make a permanent reinvestment assertion, we recognize
a provision for deferred income taxes. For earnings where we have made a
permanent reinvestment assertion, no provision is recognized. See Note 5 for
further discussion.

We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in interest
expense and SG&A, respectively, on our consolidated statements of earnings.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are recognized in
other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated
balance sheets.

We are subject to global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") tax, an
incremental tax on foreign income. We have made an accounting election to
record this tax in the period the tax arises.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income includes net earnings adjusted for certain gains and
losses that are excluded from net earnings and recognized within accumulated
other comprehensive loss as a component of equity, which consist primarily of
foreign currency translation adjustments. Accumulated other comprehensive loss
also includes net losses on cash flow hedges that were immaterial as of
January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022. Reclassifications from accumulated
other comprehensive loss into earnings were immaterial in fiscal 2022, fiscal
2021, and fiscal 2020.

Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into
U.S. dollars at the current rate of exchange on the last day of the reporting
period. Revenues and expenses are translated using average exchange rates for
the period and equity transactions are translated using the actual rate on the
day of the transaction. Cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of January 29, 2023 and
January 30, 2022 were losses of $597 million and $575 million, respectively.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

ASU No. 2021-10. In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10,
"Government Assistance (Topic 832)," to improve the transparency of government
assistance received by business entities that are accounted for by applying
either the International Accounting Standards 20 grant model or Accounting
Standards Codification 958-605 contribution model by analogy. Topic 832
requires disclosure of the nature of the transactions and the related
accounting policy used, the line items on the balance sheet and income
statement that are affected and the amounts applicable to each financial
statement line item, and significant terms of the transactions. On January 31,
2022, we adopted ASU No. 2021-10 with no impact to our financial statements or
related disclosures as the transactions in scope of this guidance were
immaterial.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

ASU No. 2022-04. In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04,
"Liabilities--Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50) - Disclosure of
Supplier Finance Program Obligations," to enhance the transparency of supplier
finance programs used by an entity in connection with the purchase of goods
and services. The standard requires entities that use supplier finance
programs to disclose the key terms, including a description of payment terms,
the confirmed amount outstanding under the program at the end of each
reporting period, a description of where those obligations are presented on
the balance sheet, and an annual rollforward, including the amount of
obligations confirmed and the amount paid during the period. The guidance does
not affect the recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation
of obligations covered by supplier finance programs. ASU No. 2022-04 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including
interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the requirement on
rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating
the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial statement
disclosures.

ASU No. 2020-04. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, "Reference
Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform
on Financial Reporting," which provides practical expedients and exceptions
for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions
affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The expedients
and exceptions provided by the amendments in this update apply only to
contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR
or another reference rate expected to be discontinued as a result of reference
rate reform. ASU No. 2020-04 is effective as of March 12,

2020 and may be applied to contract modifications and hedging relationships
from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to
March 12, 2020. This guidance was subsequently amended by ASU No. 2022-06,
"Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848,"
which was effective upon issuance in December 2022 and extended the temporary
relief provided by Topic 848 through December 31, 2024. While the
discontinuance of LIBOR will impact our interest rate swap agreements, we do
not anticipate the transition to a new reference rate and adoption of this
standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition,
results of operations, or cash flows.

Recent accounting pronouncements adopted or pending adoption not discussed
above are either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact
on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

2.SEGMENT REPORTING AND NET SALES

We currently conduct our retail operations in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico,
each of which represents one of our three operating segments. Our operating
segments reflect the way in which internally-reported financial information is
regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker to analyze
performance, make decisions and allocate resources. For disclosure purposes,
we aggregate these three operating segments into one reportable segment due to
the similar nature of their operations and economic characteristics.

Short-Term Debt

In July 2022, we expanded our commercial paper program from $3.0 billion to
$5.0 billion to further enhance our financial flexibility. All of our short-
term borrowings in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 were under our commercial paper
program. In connection with our program, we had back-up credit facilities with
a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $5.0 billion at January 29, 2023,
which consisted of a five-year $3.5 billion credit facility scheduled to
expire in July 2027 and a 364-day $1.5 billion credit facility scheduled to
expire in July 2023. These facilities replaced our previously existing five-
year $2.0 billion credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in December
2023, and our 364-day $1.0 billion credit facility, which was scheduled to
expire in December 2022.

At January 29, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding under our commercial
paper program, and at January 30, 2022, we had $1.0 billion of borrowings
outstanding under our commercial paper program with a weighted-average
interest rate of 0.1%.

The following table presents additional information on borrowings under our
commercial paper program during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021:

•Issuance costs totaled $22 million.

Repayments. In March 2022, we repaid our $700 million 3.25% senior notes and
$300 million floating rate senior notes at maturity. In May 2022, we repaid
our $1.25 billion 2.625% senior notes, which had a maturity date of June 2022,
at the Par Call Date for the notes.

Redemption. All of our senior notes may be redeemed by us at any time, in
whole or in part, at the redemption price plus accrued interest up to the
redemption date. With respect to the 5.875% 2036 notes, the redemption price
is equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be
redeemed, or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled
payments of principal and interest on the notes to be redeemed that would be
due after the related redemption date. With respect to all other notes, prior
to the Par Call Date, as defined in the respective notes, the redemption price
is equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be
redeemed or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled
payments of principal and interest to the Par Call Date. On or after the Par
Call Date, the redemption price is equal to 100% of the principal amount of
the notes. Additionally, if a Change in Control Triggering Event occurs, as
defined in the notes, holders of all such notes have the right to require us
to redeem those notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes
plus accrued interest up to the redemption date.

The indentures governing the notes do not generally limit our ability to incur
additional indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or
specified levels of net worth or liquidity. The indentures governing the notes
contain various customary covenants; however, none are expected to impact our
liquidity or capital resources.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

We use derivative instruments as part of our normal business operations in the
management of our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
and interest rates on certain debt. Our objective in managing these exposures
is to decrease the volatility of cash flows affected by changes in the
underlying rates and minimize the risk of changes in the fair value of our
senior notes.

Fair Value Hedges. We had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with
combined notional amounts of $5.4 billion at January 29, 2023 and January 30,
2022. These agreements were accounted for as fair value hedges that swap fixed
for variable rate interest to hedge changes in the fair values of certain
senior notes. At January 29, 2023, the fair values of these agreements totaled
$778 million, all of which is recognized in other long-term liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheet. At January 30, 2022, the fair values of these
agreements totaled $191 million, with $58 million recognized in other assets
and $249 million recognized in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheet. All of our interest rate swap agreements designated as fair
value hedges meet the shortcut method requirements under GAAP. Accordingly,
the changes in the fair values of these agreements offset the changes in the
fair value of the hedged long-term debt.

Cash Flow Hedges. At January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, we had outstanding
foreign currency forward contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges, which
hedge the variability of forecasted cash flows associated with certain
payments made in our foreign operations. At January 29, 2023 and January 30,
2022, the notional amounts and the fair values of these contracts were not
material. Additionally, the realized and unrealized gains and losses on these
instruments were not material during fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal
2020.

We also settled forward-starting interest rate swap agreements in prior years,
which were used to hedge the variability in future interest payments
attributable to changing interest rates on forecasted debt issuances.
Unamortized losses on these forward-starting swaps, which were designated as
cash flow hedges, are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the
respective notes. Unamortized losses recognized on these swaps remaining in
accumulated other comprehensive loss were immaterial as of January 29, 2023
and January 30, 2022, as were the losses recognized within interest expense
for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020.

We expect an immaterial amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
loss as of January 29, 2023 to be reclassified into earnings within the next
12 months.

Net Investment Hedges. During fiscal 2022, we issued foreign currency forward
contracts accounted for as net investment hedges, which hedged against foreign
currency exposure on our net investment in certain subsidiaries. These foreign
currency forward contracts were immaterial and were settled in fiscal 2022.
The related foreign currency translation adjustment amounts recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive loss upon settlement were also immaterial.
There were no arrangements accounted for as net investment hedges outstanding
as of January 29, 2023 or January 30, 2022.

Collateral. We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which are
designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions
with the same counterparty. To further limit our credit risk, we enter into
collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or
posted when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments exceeds or
falls below contractually established thresholds. The cash collateral posted
by the Company related to derivative instruments under our collateral security
arrangements was $634 million as of January 29, 2023, which was recorded in
other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. We did not hold any
cash collateral as of January 29, 2023, and cash collateral both held and
posted was immaterial as of January 30, 2022.

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ("2022 Tax Act") was
enacted into law. The key tax provisions include a 15% minimum tax on adjusted
financial statement income. We do not expect any impact to the Company's
effective tax rate as a result of the new 15% minimum tax under the 2022 Tax
Act.

As of January 29, 2023, we recorded deferred tax assets of $115 million for
net operating losses, primarily related to state jurisdictions. These losses
expire at various dates beginning in 2023. We have concluded that it is more
likely than not that tax benefits related to substantially all net operating
losses will be realized based upon the expectation that we will generate the
necessary taxable income in future periods.

Reinvestment of Unremitted Earnings

Substantially all of our current year foreign cash earnings in excess of
working capital and cash needed for strategic investments are not intended to
be indefinitely reinvested offshore. Therefore, the tax effects of
repatriation for applicable state taxes and foreign withholding taxes of such
cash earnings have been provided for in the accompanying consolidated
statements of earnings. We have the intent and ability to reinvest
substantially all of the $4.1 billion of non-cash unremitted earnings of our
non-U.S. subsidiaries indefinitely. Accordingly, no provision for state taxes
or foreign withholding taxes was recorded on these unremitted earnings in the
accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. It is impracticable for us
to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities on these
indefinitely reinvested earnings due to the complexities associated with the
hypothetical calculation.

Tax Return Examination Status

Our income tax returns are routinely examined by U.S. federal, state and
local, and foreign tax authorities. As of January 29, 2023, the Company is no
longer subject to U.S. federal examinations by tax authorities for years
before fiscal 2010. Our U.S. federal tax returns for fiscal years 2010 through
2021, with the exception of 2015, are currently under examination by the IRS.
With respect to the fiscal years 2010 to 2014, the IRS has issued a proposed
adjustment relating to transfer pricing between our entities in the U.S. and
China. We are defending our position using all available remedies. There are
also ongoing U.S. state and local audits and other foreign audits covering
fiscal years 2013 through 2020. We do not expect the results from any ongoing
income tax audit to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

Over the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that the resolution of
federal and state tax examinations, as well as the expiration of statutes of
limitations, could reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by an immaterial
amount. We do not anticipate the resolution of these matters will result in a
material change to our consolidated financial condition or results of
operations.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

The following table reconciles the beginning and ending amount of our gross
unrecognized tax benefits:

million at January 29, 2023, January 30, 2022, and January 31, 2021,
respectively.

Interest and Penalties

Net adjustments to accruals for interest and penalties associated with
uncertain tax positions were immaterial in fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and
fiscal 2020. Our total accrued interest and penalties associated with
uncertain tax positions were immaterial as of January 29, 2023 and January 30,
2022.

Share Repurchases

In August 2022, our Board of Directors approved a $15.0 billion share
repurchase authorization that replaced the previous authorization of $20.0
billion, which was approved in May 2021. This new authorization does not have
a prescribed expiration date. As of January 29, 2023, approximately $12.5
billion of the $15.0 billion share repurchase authorization remained
available.

In March 2020, we suspended our share repurchases to enhance our liquidity
position as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We resumed share repurchases in
the first quarter of fiscal 2021.

The following table presents information about our repurchases of common
stock, all of which were completed through open market purchases:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

Total cost of shares repurchased

| $| 6,504 | | | $| 15,001 | | | $| 597 |  
  
These amounts may differ from the repurchases of common stock amounts in the
consolidated statements of cash flows due to unsettled share repurchases at
the end of a period.

7.FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of an asset is considered to be the price at which the asset
could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated knowledgeable and
willing parties. A liability's fair value is defined as the amount that would
be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, rather than the amount
that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Assets and
liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using a three-tier fair value
hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The
levels of the fair value hierarchy are:

•Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities;

•Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets in Level 1 that
are either directly or indirectly observable; and

•Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists,
therefore requiring management judgment to develop the Company's own models
with estimates and assumptions.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

The following table presents the assets and liabilities that are measured at
fair value on a recurring basis:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

Total

| $| -- | | | $| (778)| | | $| -- | | | $| -- | | | $| (191)| | | $| -- |  
  
The fair values of our derivative instruments are determined using an income
approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the respective interest rate or
foreign currency forward curves and discount rates. Our derivative instruments
are discussed further in Note 4.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Long-lived assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets are subject to
nonrecurring fair value measurement for the assessment of impairment. We did
not have any material assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value
on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, or fiscal 2020.

Other Fair Value Disclosures

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, short-term
debt, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to their short-term
nature.

Incentive Plan (the "1997 Plan" and collectively with the Omnibus Plan, the
"Plans") provide that incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance
shares, performance units, deferred shares, and other stock-based awards may
be issued to certain of our associates and non-employee directors. Under the
Omnibus Plan, the maximum number of shares of our common stock authorized for
issuance is 80 million shares plus a number of shares (not to exceed 10
million) related to underlying awards outstanding as of May 19, 2022, which
can be returned to the share pool if those awards are subsequently terminated
or expire unexercised, or are cancelled, forfeited or lapse for any reason,
with any award other than a stock option or stock appreciation right reducing
the number of shares available for issuance by 2.11 shares. At January 29,
2023, there were approximately 80 million shares available for future grants
under the Omnibus Plan. No additional equity awards could be issued from the
1997 Plan after May 26, 2005.

The following table presents total stock-based compensation expense, net of
estimated forfeitures, including expense related to our ESPPs, and related
income tax benefit:

After-tax stock-based compensation expense| $| 294 | | | $| 317 | | | $| 252 |  
  
At January 29, 2023, there was $424 million of unrecognized stock-based
compensation expense, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted
average period of two years.

The award types issued under the Plans are as follows:

Stock Options. Under the terms of the Plans, incentive stock options and
nonqualified stock options must have an exercise price at or above the fair
market value of our stock on the date of the grant. Typically, nonqualified
stock options vest at the rate of 25% per year commencing on the second
anniversary date of the grant and expire on the tenth anniversary date of the
grant. Additionally, a majority of our stock options may become non-
forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60, provided the associate has had
five years of continuous service. No incentive stock options have been issued
under the Omnibus Plan.

We estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Our determination of fair value of
stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-
pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding
a number of variables.

The following table presents the per share weighted average fair value of
stock options granted and the assumptions used in determining fair value at

Shares of common stock issued from stock option exercises may be issued from
authorized and unissued common stock or treasury stock.

Restricted Stock and Performance Share Awards. Restrictions on the restricted
stock issued under the Plans generally lapse over various periods up to five
years. At the grant date of the award, recipients of restricted stock are
granted voting rights and generally receive dividends on unvested shares, paid
in the form of cash on each dividend payment date. Dividends paid on unvested
shares were immaterial for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020.
Additionally, the majority of our restricted stock awards may become non-
forfeitable upon the associate's attainment of age 60, provided the associate
has had five years of continuous service.

We have also granted performance share awards under the Plans. These awards
provide for the issuance of shares of our common stock at the end of the
three-year performance cycle based upon our performance against target average
ROIC and operating profit over that performance cycle. Additionally, the
awards become non-forfeitable upon the associate's attainment of age 60,
provided the associate has had five years of continuous service and minimum
performance targets are achieved. Recipients of performance share awards have
no voting rights until the shares are issued following completion of the
performance period. Dividend equivalents accrue on the performance shares (as
reinvested shares) and are paid upon the payout of the award based upon the
actual number of shares earned. The fair value of the restricted stock and
performance shares is based on the closing stock price on the date of grant
and is expensed over the period during which the restrictions lapse.

Restricted Stock Units. Each restricted stock unit entitles the associate to
one share of common stock to be received upon vesting up to five years after
the grant date. Additionally, the majority of these awards may become non-
forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60, provided the associate has had
five years of continuous service. Recipients of restricted stock units have no
voting rights until the vesting of the award. Recipients receive dividend
equivalents that accrue on unvested units and are paid out in the form of
additional shares of stock on the vesting date. The fair value of the
restricted stock units is based on the closing stock price on the date of
grant and is expensed over the period during which the units vest.

Deferred Shares. We grant awards of deferred shares to non-employee directors
under the Plans. Each deferred share entitles the non-employee director to one
share of common stock to be received following termination of Board service.
Recipients of deferred shares have no voting rights and receive dividend
equivalents that accrue and are paid out in the form of additional shares of
stock upon payout of the underlying shares following termination of service.
The fair value of the deferred shares is based on the closing stock price on
the date of grant and is expensed immediately upon grant.

directors:

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

We maintain two ESPPs: a U.S. and a non-U.S. plan. The plan for U.S.
associates is a tax-qualified plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue
Code. The non-U.S. plan is not a Section 423 plan. At January 29, 2023, there
were approximately 16 million shares available under the U.S. plan and
approximately 18 million shares available under the non-U.S. plan. The
purchase price of shares under the ESPPs is equal to 85% of the stock's fair
market value on the last day of the purchase period, which is a six-month
period ending on December 31 and June 30 of each year. During fiscal 2022,
there were approximately 1 million shares purchased under the ESPPs at an
average price of $247.86. Under the outstanding ESPPs at January 29, 2023,
associates have contributed $22 million to purchase shares at 85% of the
stock's fair market value on the last day of the current purchase period, June
30, 2023.

9.EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

We maintain active defined contribution retirement plans for our associates
(the "Benefit Plans"). All associates satisfying certain service requirements
are eligible to participate in the Benefit Plans. We make cash contributions
each payroll period up to specified percentages of associates' contributions
as approved by our Board of Directors.

We also maintain the Restoration Plans to provide certain associates deferred
compensation that they would have received under the Benefit Plans as a
matching contribution if not for the maximum compensation limits under the
Internal Revenue Code. We fund the Restoration Plans through contributions
made to grantor trusts, which are then used to purchase shares of our common
stock in the open market.

The following table presents our contributions to the Benefit Plans and the
Restoration Plans:

11.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

At January 29, 2023, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $486
million, primarily related to certain business transactions, including
insurance programs, trade contracts, and construction contracts.

We are involved in litigation arising in the normal course of business. In
management's opinion, any such litigation is not expected to have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations,
or cash flows.

12\. HD SUPPLY ACQUISITION

On November 16, 2020, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement
to acquire HD Supply, a leading national distributor of MRO products to
multifamily, hospitality, healthcare, and government housing facilities, among
others. Under the terms of the merger agreement, a subsidiary of Home Depot
made a cash tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of the common
stock of HD Supply Holdings, Inc., the ultimate parent entity of HD Supply,
for $56 per share, and the acquisition was completed on December 24, 2020. The
acquisition was funded through cash on hand, a portion of which was replaced
with the proceeds from our issuance of $3.0 billion of senior notes in January
2021.

The following table summarizes total purchase consideration:

| | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
in millions |  
Total cash consideration for outstanding shares| $| 8,637 |  
  
Value of stock-based awards attributed to services already rendered (1)

| 55 |  
Total purchase consideration| $| 8,692 |  
  
----------

(1) In connection with the completion of the acquisition, all HD Supply stock-
based awards were cash settled for an aggregate value of $111 million. As the
settlement of the awards was at the discretion of the Company, the portion of
the fair value of the awards attributed to services previously provided of $55
million was included as part of purchase consideration, with the remaining $56
million recognized as post-combination expense within SG&A in our consolidated
statement of earnings for fiscal 2020.

The total purchase consideration of $8.7 billion, less cash acquired of $912
million, resulted in a net cash outflow of $7.8 billion on the consolidated
statement of cash flows in fiscal 2020.

Net sales and net earnings for fiscal 2020 attributable to HD Supply after the
completion of the acquisition were immaterial. Pro forma results of operations
would not be materially different as a result of the acquisition and therefore
are not presented.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules
and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on
that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule
13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with
the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023 based on
the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of January 29, 2023 in providing reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
January 29, 2023 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

We are in the process of an ongoing business transformation initiative, which
includes upgrading and migrating certain accounting and finance systems. We
plan to continue to migrate additional business processes over the course of
the next few years and have modified and will continue to modify the design
and implementation of certain internal control processes as the transformation
continues.

Except as described above, there were no other changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended January 29, 2023 that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors

The Home Depot, Inc.:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal
control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023, based on criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023, based on criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance
sheets of the Company as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, the related
consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period
ended January 29, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated
financial statements), and our report dated March 15, 2023 expressed an
unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to
the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting
was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over
financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,
and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
