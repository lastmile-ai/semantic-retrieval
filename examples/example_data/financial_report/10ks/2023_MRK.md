PART I

Item 1.Business.

Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck or the Company) is a global health care company that
delivers innovative health solutions through its prescription medicines,
including biologic therapies, vaccines and animal health products. The
Company's operations are principally managed on a product basis and include
two operating segments, Pharmaceutical and Animal Health, both of which are
reportable segments.

The Pharmaceutical segment includes human health pharmaceutical and vaccine
products. Human health pharmaceutical products consist of therapeutic and
preventive agents, generally sold by prescription, for the treatment of human
disorders. The Company sells these human health pharmaceutical products
primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies
and managed health care providers such as health maintenance organizations,
pharmacy benefit managers and other institutions. Human health vaccine
products consist of preventive pediatric, adolescent and adult vaccines. The
Company sells these human health vaccines primarily to physicians,
wholesalers, physician distributors and government entities.

The Animal Health segment discovers, develops, manufactures and markets a wide

of disease in all major livestock and companion animal species. The Company
also offers an extensive suite of digitally connected identification,
traceability and monitoring products. The Company sells its products to
veterinarians, distributors, animal producers, farmers and pet owners.

On June 2, 2021, Merck completed the spin-off (the Spin-Off) of products from
its women's health, biosimilars and established brands businesses into a new,
independent, publicly traded company named Organon & Co. (Organon) through a
distribution of Organon's publicly traded stock to Company shareholders. The
established brands included in the transaction consisted of dermatology, non-
opioid pain management, respiratory, select cardiovascular products, as well
as the rest of Merck's diversified brands franchise. Merck's existing research
pipeline programs continue to be owned and developed within Merck as planned.

The markets in which the Company conducts its business and the pharmaceutical
industry in general are highly competitive and highly regulated. The Company's
competitors include other worldwide research-based pharmaceutical companies,
smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus, generic drug
manufacturers, and animal health care companies. The Company's operations may
be adversely affected by generic and biosimilar competition as the Company's
products mature, as well as technological advances of competitors, industry
consolidation, patents granted to competitors, competitive combination
products, new products of competitors, the generic availability of
competitors' branded products, and new information from clinical trials of
marketed products or post-marketing surveillance. In addition, patent rights
are increasingly being challenged by competitors, and the outcome can be
highly uncertain. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude
commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products
and could result in the payment of royalties or in the recognition of an
impairment charge with respect to intangible assets associated with certain
products.

Pharmaceutical competition involves a rigorous search for technological
innovations and the ability to market these innovations effectively. With its
long-standing emphasis on research and development, the Company is well-
positioned to compete in the search for technological innovations. The Company
is active in acquiring and

marketing products through external alliances, such as licensing arrangements
and collaborations and has been refining its sales and marketing efforts to
address changing industry conditions. However, the introduction of new
products and processes by competitors may result in price reductions and
product displacements, even for products protected by patents. For example,
the number of compounds available to treat a particular disease typically
increases over time and can result in slowed sales growth or reduced sales for
the Company's products in that therapeutic category.

The highly competitive animal health business is affected by several factors
including regulatory and legislative issues, scientific and technological
advances, product innovation, the quality and price of the Company's products
as well as competitors' products, effective promotional efforts and the
frequent introduction of generic products by competitors.

Health Care Environment and Government Regulation

Global efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure
on product pricing and market access. Changes to the U.S. health care system
as part of health care reform enacted in prior years, as well as increased
purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid,
and private sector beneficiaries, have contributed to pricing pressure. In
several international markets, government-mandated pricing actions have
reduced prices of generic and patented drugs. In addition, the Company's sales
performance in 2022 was negatively affected by other cost-reduction measures
taken by governments and other third parties to lower health care costs. In
the U.S., the Biden Administration and Congress continue to discuss
legislation designed to control health care costs, including the cost of
drugs. The Company anticipates all of these actions and additional actions in
the future will continue to negatively affect sales and profits.

United States

The Company faces increasing pricing pressure from managed care organizations,
government agencies and programs that could negatively affect the Company's
sales and profit margins, including, through (i) practices of managed care
organizations, federal and state exchanges, and institutional and governmental
purchasers, and (ii) federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and
Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and
Modernization Act of 2003, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of
2010 (ACA), the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (American Rescue Plan Act),
and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Inflation Reduction Act).

In the U.S., federal and state governments for many years have pursued methods
to reduce the cost of drugs and vaccines for which they pay. For example,
federal and state laws require the Company to pay specified rebates for
medicines reimbursed by Medicaid and to provide discounts for medicines
purchased by certain state and federal entities such as the Department of
Defense, Veterans Affairs, Public Health Service entities and hospitals
serving a disproportionate share of low income or uninsured patients.

Additionally in the U.S., consolidation and integration among health care
providers is a major factor in the competitive marketplace for pharmaceutical
products. Health plans and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) have been
consolidating into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their purchasing
strength and importance. Private third-party insurers, as well as governments,
employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in
exchange for formulary inclusion. Failure to obtain timely or adequate pricing
or formulary placement for Merck's products or obtaining such placement at
unfavorable pricing could adversely affect revenue. In addition to formulary
tier co-pay differentials, private health insurance companies and self-insured
employers have been increasing the cost-sharing required from beneficiaries,
particularly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products. Private
health insurance companies also are increasingly imposing utilization
management tools, such as clinical protocols, requiring prior authorization
for a branded product or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more
generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine. These same
management tools are also used in treatment areas in which the payor has taken
the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. As
the U.S. payor market concentrates further, the Company may face greater
pricing pressure from private third-party payors.

In order to provide information about the Company's pricing practices, the
Company annually posts on its website its Pricing Transparency Report for the
U.S. The report provides the Company's average annual list price, net price
increases, and average discounts across the Company's U.S. portfolio dating
back to 2010. In 2022, the Company's gross U.S. sales were reduced by 39.7% as
a result of rebates, discounts and returns.

Legislative Changes

In 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which makes significant
changes to how drugs are covered and paid for under the Medicare program,
including the creation of financial penalties for drugs whose prices rise
faster than the rate of inflation, redesign of the Medicare Part D program to
require manufacturers to bear more of

6

Table of Contents

the liability for certain drug benefits, and government price-setting for
certain Medicare Part D drugs, starting in 2026, and Medicare Part B drugs
starting in 2028.

The long-term implications of the Inflation Reduction Act remain uncertain and
subject to various factors, including the manner in which U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services decides to implement the statute. Many experts and
analysts, both within the industry and outside, have predicted that the law
will harm innovation in the pharmaceutical industry and result in fewer new
treatments being developed and approved over time. Merck is working to
mitigate the potentially harmful effects that the law could have on
innovation.

In addition, in 2021, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act, which
included a provision that eliminates the statutory cap on rebates drug
manufacturers pay to Medicaid beginning in January 2024. These rebates act as
a discount off the list price and eliminating the cap means that manufacturer
discounts paid to Medicaid can increase. Prior to this change, manufacturers
have not been required to pay more than 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price
(AMP) in rebates to state Medicaid programs for Medicaid-covered drugs. As a
result of this provision, beginning in 2024, it is possible that manufacturers
may have to pay state Medicaid programs more in rebates than they received on
sales of particular products. This change could present a risk to Merck in the
future for drugs that have high Medicaid utilization and rebate exposure that
is more than 100% of the AMP.

The Company also faces increasing pricing pressure in the states, which are
looking to exert greater influence over the price of prescription drugs. A
number of states have passed pharmaceutical price and cost transparency laws.
These laws typically require manufacturers to report certain product price
information or other financial data to the state. Some laws also require
manufacturers to provide advance notification of price increases. The Company
expects that states will continue their focus on pharmaceutical pricing and
will increasingly shift to more aggressive price control tools such as
Prescription Drug Affordability Boards that have the authority to conduct
affordability reviews and establish upper payment limits.

Regulatory Changes

In November 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of
Inspector General issued a Final Rule that would have, effective January 1,
2023, eliminated the Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbor for rebates paid to
Medicare Part D plans or to PBMs on behalf of such plans. Congress has delayed
implementation of this Final Rule until January 1, 2026 and pending federal
legislation would repeal it entirely. While the Company cannot anticipate the
effects of this change to the way it currently contracts, this new framework
could significantly alter the way it does business with Part D Plan Sponsors
and PBMs on behalf of such plans. This rulemaking also established, effective
January 1, 2021, a new safe harbor for point of sale discounts at the pharmacy
counter and a new safe harbor for certain service arrangements between
pharmaceutical manufacturers and PBMs.

The pharmaceutical industry also could be considered a potential source of
savings via other legislative and administrative proposals that have been
debated but not enacted. These types of revenue generating or cost saving
proposals include additional direct price controls.

European Union

Efforts toward health care cost containment remain intense in the European
Union (EU). The Company faces competitive pricing pressure resulting from
generic and biosimilar drugs. In addition, a majority of countries in the EU
attempt to contain drug costs by engaging in reference pricing in which
authorities examine pre-determined markets for published prices of drugs.
Reference pricing may either compare a product's prices in other markets
(external reference pricing), or compare a product's price with those of other
products in a national class (internal reference pricing). The authorities
then use the price data to set new local prices for brand-name drugs,
including the Company's drugs. Guidelines for examining reference pricing are
usually set in local markets and can be changed pursuant to local regulations.
Some EU Member States have established free-pricing systems, but regulate the
pricing for drugs through profit control plans. Others seek to negotiate or
set prices based on the cost-effectiveness of a product or an assessment of
whether it offers a therapeutic benefit over other products in the relevant
class. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly
prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high
barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In some EU Member
States, cross-border imports from low-priced markets also exert competitive
pressure that may reduce pricing within an EU Member State.

Additionally, EU Member States have the power to restrict the range of
pharmaceutical products for which their national health insurance systems
provide reimbursement. In the EU, pricing and reimbursement plans vary widely
from Member State to Member State. Some EU Member States provide that drug
products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed.
Some EU Member States may require the completion of additional studies that
compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to already
available therapies or so-called health technology assessments (HTA), in order
to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. The HTA of pharmaceutical
products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and
reimbursement procedures in

7

* * *

Table of Contents

most EU Member States. The HTA process, which is governed by the national laws
of these countries, involves the assessment of the cost-effectiveness, public
health impact, therapeutic impact and/or the economic and social impact of use
of a given pharmaceutical product in the national health care system of the
individual country in which it is conducted. Ultimately, HTA measures the
added value of a new health technology compared to existing ones. The outcome
of HTAs regarding specific pharmaceutical products will often influence the
pricing and reimbursement status granted to these pharmaceutical products by
the regulatory authorities of individual EU Member States. A negative HTA of
one of the Company's products may mean that the product is not reimbursable or
may force the Company to reduce its reimbursement price or offer discounts or
rebates.

A negative HTA by a leading and recognized HTA body could also undermine the
Company's ability to obtain reimbursement for the relevant product outside a
jurisdiction. For example, EU Member States that have not yet developed HTA
mechanisms may rely to some extent on the HTA performed in other countries
with a developed HTA framework, to inform their pricing and reimbursement
decisions. HTA procedures require additional data, reviews and administrative
processes, all of which increase the complexity, timing and costs of obtaining
product reimbursement and exert downward pressure on available reimbursement.

To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some EU Member States, the
Company may be required to conduct studies that compare the cost-effectiveness
of the Company's product candidates to other therapies that are considered the
local standard of care. There can be no assurance that any EU Member State
will allow favorable pricing, reimbursement and market access conditions for
any of the Company's products, or that it will be feasible to conduct
additional cost-effectiveness studies, if required.

Japan

In Japan, the pharmaceutical industry is subject to government-mandated annual
price reductions of pharmaceutical products and certain vaccines. Furthermore,
the government can order re-pricings for specific products if it determines
that use of such product will exceed certain thresholds defined under
applicable re-pricing rules. In addition, if a Merck product has the same
medical action or composition of another product that is subject to market
expansion re-pricing, the Merck product could also be subject to re-pricing
unless it meets exception criteria. The next government-mandated price
reduction will occur in April 2023.

China

The Company's business in China has grown rapidly in the past few years, and
the importance of China to the Company's overall pharmaceutical and vaccines
business has increased accordingly. Continued growth of the Company's business
in China is dependent upon ongoing development of a favorable environment for
innovative pharmaceutical products and vaccines, sustained access for the
Company's current in-line products, and the absence of trade impediments or
adverse pricing controls. In recent years, the Chinese government has
introduced and implemented a number of structural reforms to accelerate the
shift to innovative products and reduce costs. Since 2017, there have been
multiple new policies introduced by the government to improve access to new
innovation, reduce the complexity of regulatory filings, and accelerate the
review and approval process. This has led to a significant increase in the
number of new products being approved each year. While the mechanism for drugs
being added to the government's National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL)
evolves, inclusion may require a price negotiation which could impact the
outlook in the market for selected brands. In 2021, drugs were added to the
NRDL with an average of more than 60% price reductions. A new NRDL was
recently completed in which new entries averaged 60% price reductions. While
pricing pressure has always existed in China, health care reform has increased
this pressure in part due to the acceleration of generic substitution through
volume based procurement (VBP). In 2019, the government implemented the VBP
program through a tendering process for mature products which have generic
substitutes with a Generic Quality Consistency Evaluation approval. Mature
products that have entered into the last five rounds of VBP had, on average, a
price reduction of more than 50%. The Company expects VBP to be a semi-annual
process that will have a significant impact on mature products moving forward.

Emerging Markets

The Company's focus on emerging markets, in addition to China, has continued.
Governments in many emerging markets are also focused on constraining health
care costs and have enacted price controls and measures impacting intellectual
property, including in exceptional cases, threats of compulsory licenses, that
aim to put pressure on the price of innovative pharmaceuticals or result in
constrained market access to innovative medicine. The Company anticipates that
pricing pressures and market access challenges will continue in the future to
varying degrees in the emerging markets.

Beyond pricing and market access challenges, other conditions in emerging
market countries can affect the Company's efforts to continue to grow in these
markets, including potential political instability, changes in trade sanctions
and embargoes, significant currency fluctuation and controls, financial
crises, limited or changing availability of funding for health care, credit
worthiness of health care partners, such as hospitals, and other

8

Table of Contents

developments that may adversely impact the business environment for the
Company. Further, the Company may engage third-party agents to assist in
operating in emerging market countries, which may affect its ability to
realize continued growth and may also increase the Company's risk exposure.

In addressing global cost containment pressures, the Company engages in public
policy advocacy with policymakers and continues to work to demonstrate that
its medicines provide value to patients and to those who pay for health care.
The Company advocates with government policymakers to encourage a long-term
approach to sustainable health care financing that ensures access to
innovative medicines and does not disproportionately target pharmaceuticals as
a source of budget savings. In markets with historically low rates of health
care spending, the Company encourages those governments to increase their
investments and adopt market reforms in order to improve their citizens'
access to appropriate health care, including medicines.

Operating conditions have become more challenging under the global pressures
of competition, industry regulation and cost containment efforts. Although no
one can predict the effect of these and other factors on the Company's
business, the Company continually takes measures to evaluate, adapt and
improve the organization and its business practices to better meet customer
needs and believes that it is well-positioned to respond to the evolving
health care environment and market forces.

Regulation

The pharmaceutical industry is also subject to regulation by regional,
country, state and local agencies around the world focused on standards and
processes for determining drug safety and effectiveness, as well as conditions
for sale or reimbursement.

Of particular importance is the FDA in the U.S., which administers
requirements covering the testing, approval, safety, effectiveness,
manufacturing, labeling, and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals. In
some cases, the FDA requirements and practices have increased the amount of
time and resources necessary to develop new products and bring them to market
in the U.S. At the same time, the FDA has committed to expediting the
development and review of products bearing the "breakthrough therapy"
designation, which has accelerated the regulatory review process for medicines
with this designation. The FDA has also undertaken efforts to bring generic
competition to market more efficiently and in a more timely manner.

The EU has adopted directives and other legislation concerning the
classification, approval for marketing, labeling, advertising, manufacturing,
wholesale distribution, integrity of the supply chain, pharmacovigilance and
safety monitoring of medicinal products for human use. These provide mandatory
standards throughout the EU, which may be supplemented or implemented with
additional regulations by the EU Member States. In particular, EU regulators
may approve products subject to a number of post-authorization conditions.
Examples of typical post-authorization commitments include additional
pharmacovigilance, the conduct of clinical trials, the establishment of
patient registries, physician or patient education and controlled distribution
and prescribing arrangements. Non-compliance with post-authorization
conditions, pharmacovigilance and other obligations can lead to regulatory
action, including the variation, suspension or withdrawal of the marketing
authorizations, or other enforcement or regulatory actions, including the
imposition of financial penalties. The Company's policies and procedures are
already consistent with the substance of these directives; consequently, it is
believed that they will not have any material effect on the Company's
business.

The Company believes that it will continue to be able to conduct its
operations, including launching new drugs, in this regulatory environment.
(See "Research and Development" below for a discussion of the regulatory
approval process.)

Access to Medicines

As a global health care company, Merck's primary role is to discover and
develop innovative medicines and vaccines. The Company also recognizes that,
in collaboration with key stakeholders, it has a role to play in helping to
ensure that its science advances health care, and its products are accessible
and affordable. The Company is committed to ensuring a reliable, safe global
supply of its quality medicines and vaccines, and to developing, testing and
implementing innovative solutions that address barriers to access and
affordability of its medicines and vaccines. The Company's approach is
designed to enable it to serve the greatest number of patients today, while
meeting the needs of patients in the future. The Company's efforts in this
regard are wide-ranging and include a set of principles that the Company
strives to embed into its operations and business strategies to guide the
Company's worldwide approach to expanding access to health care. The Company
systematically evaluates its pipeline candidates to identify potential to
address significant public health burden and unmet medical needs in
underserved health care settings. Products continue to be evaluated for their
potential throughout their life cycle to account for changes in the external
environment. The Company also collaborates with different stakeholders,

including private, governmental, multilateral and non-profit organizations, to
design and deliver sustainable solutions to help address access challenges at
the payer, provider and patient levels.

In addition, through innovative social investments, including philanthropic
programs and impact investing, Merck is helping to strengthen health systems
and build capacity, particularly in under-resourced communities. The Merck
Patient Assistance Program provides certain medicines and adult vaccines for
free to people in the U.S. who do not have prescription drug or health
insurance coverage and who, without the Company's assistance, cannot afford
their Merck medicines and vaccines. Globally, Merck has made substantial
contributions to access to health through key initiatives, including product
donations for humanitarian assistance in low-income countries through the
Medical Outreach Program. The Mectizan Donation Program, the longest running
disease-specific drug donation program of its kind, supports the elimination
of two neglected tropical diseases - onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis.
Additionally, through Merck for Mothers the Company provides funding, and
scientific and business acumen to help global health partners end preventable
deaths from complications of pregnancy and childbirth. Merck has also provided
funds to the Merck Foundation, an independent grantmaking organization, which
supports a variety of organizations dedicated to addressing systemic barriers
to health equity.

Privacy and Data Protection

The Company is subject to a significant number of privacy and data protection
laws and regulations globally, many of which place restrictions on the
Company's ability to transfer, access and use personal data across its
business. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data
protection continues to evolve. There has been increased attention to privacy
and data protection issues in both developed and emerging markets with the
potential to affect directly the Company's business, including the EU General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which imposes penalties of up to 4% of
global revenue.

The GDPR and related implementing laws in individual EU Member States govern
the collection and use of personal health data and other personal data in the
EU. The GDPR increased responsibility and liability in relation to personal
data that the Company processes. It also imposes a number of strict
obligations and restrictions on the ability to process (which includes
collection, analysis and transfer of) personal data, including health data
from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. The GDPR also includes
requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal
data relates, the information provided to the individuals prior to processing
their personal data or personal health data, notification of data processing
obligations to the national data protection authorities, and the security and
confidentiality of the personal data. Further, the GDPR prohibits the transfer
of personal data to countries outside of the EU that are not considered by the
EC to provide an adequate level of data protection, including to the U.S.,
except if the data controller meets very specific requirements. Following the
Schrems II decision of the Court of Justice of the EU in 2020, there is
considerable uncertainty as to the permissibility of international data
transfers under the GDPR. In light of the implications of this decision, the
Company may face difficulties regarding the transfer of personal data from the
EU to third countries. Since then, the Company diligently entered into the EU-
approved Standard Contractual Clauses with its vendors, suppliers,
collaboration partners and clinical trial sites in order to facilitate the
lawful transfer of personal data from the EU to the U.S. In addition,
President Biden issued an Executive Order on October 7, 2022 to address the
data privacy concerns raised in the Schrems II decision through introducing,
among other measures, further safeguards and oversight of personal data
collection by U.S. signals intelligence activities and providing individuals
with a redress mechanism in the U.S. for their data protection concerns.
Further certainty for the international transfer of personal data from the EU
via the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (successor to the invalidated EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield) may come by way of a new EU Adequacy Decision, issued in draft
form by the EU Commission on December 13, 2022 and expected to come into force
in mid-2023. However, it remains likely that such a new Adequacy Decision will
be contested by privacy advocates and be subject to legal review.

Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national
data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in significant
monetary fines and other administrative penalties as well as civil liability
claims from individuals whose personal data was processed. Data protection
authorities from the different EU Member States may still implement certain
variations, enforce the GDPR and national data protection laws differently,
and introduce additional national regulations and guidelines, which adds to
the complexity of processing personal data in the EU. Guidance developed at
both the EU level and at the national level in individual EU Member States
concerning implementation and compliance practices is often updated or
otherwise revised.

There is, moreover, a growing trend towards required public disclosure of
clinical trial data in the EU which adds to the complexity of obligations
relating to processing health data from clinical trials. Failing to comply
with these obligations could lead to government enforcement actions and
significant penalties against the Company, harm to its reputation, and
adversely impact its business and operating results. The uncertainty regarding
the interplay between

10

Table of Contents

different regulatory frameworks further adds to the complexity that the
Company faces with regard to data protection regulation.

In August 2021, China passed the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL)
that aims to standardize the handling of personal information in China which
became effective in November 2021. The PIPL currently applies to the
processing of personal information of natural persons in China, the processing
of personal information outside China where the purpose is to provide products
and services in China, and to analyze the activities of individuals in China.
While similar to the GDPR, the PIPL contains unique requirements not found in
the GDPR.

The Company has developed and implemented comprehensive plans to ensure
compliance with the PIPL, with those relating to data localization and cross-
border transfers yet to be completed pending forthcoming guidance from the
Cyberspace Administration of China.

Additional laws and regulations enacted in the U.S. (such as comprehensive
data protection acts in California, Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut),
Canada, Europe, Asia, and Latin America, have increased enforcement and
litigation activity in the U.S. and other developed markets, as well as
increased regulatory cooperation among privacy authorities globally. The
Company has adopted a comprehensive global privacy program to manage these
evolving requirements and risks and to facilitate the transfer of personal
information across international borders.

Distribution

The Company sells its human health pharmaceutical products primarily to drug
wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health
care providers, such as health maintenance organizations, PBMs and other
institutions. Human health vaccines are sold primarily to physicians,
wholesalers, physician distributors and government entities. The Company's
professional representatives communicate the effectiveness, safety and value
of the Company's pharmaceutical and vaccine products to health care
professionals in private practice, group practices, hospitals and managed care
organizations. The Company sells its animal health products to veterinarians,
distributors, animal producers, farmers and pet owners.

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses

Patent protection is considered, in the aggregate, to be of material
importance to the Company's marketing of its products in the U.S. and in most
major foreign markets. Patents may cover products per se, pharmaceutical
formulations, processes for, or intermediates useful in, the manufacture of
products, or the uses of products. Protection for individual products extends
for varying periods in accordance with the legal life of patents in the
various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country
to country, depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage.

The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act includes a Pediatric
Exclusivity Provision that may provide an additional six months of market
exclusivity in the U.S. for indications of new or currently marketed drugs if
certain agreed upon pediatric studies are completed by the applicant. Current
U.S. patent law provides additional patent term for periods when the patented
product was under regulatory review by the FDA. The EU also provides an
additional six months of pediatric market exclusivity attached to a product's
Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC). Japan provides the additional term
for pediatric studies attached to market exclusivity unrelated to patent term.

Patent portfolios developed for products introduced by the Company normally
provide market exclusivity. The Company has the following key patent
protection in the U.S., the EU, Japan and China (including the potential for
patent term extensions (PTE) and SPCs where indicated) for the following
marketed products:

countries: France, Germany, Italy, and Spain (Major EU Markets). If SPC
applications have been filed but have not been granted in all Major EU
Markets, both the patent expiry date and the SPC expiry date are listed.

(2)The PTE system in Japan allows for a patent to be extended more than once
provided the later approval is directed to a different indication from that of
the previous approval. This may result in multiple PTE approvals for a given
patent, each with its own expiration date.

(3)As a result of favorable court rulings and settlement agreements related to
a later expiring patent directed to the specific sitagliptin salt form of the
products, the Company expects that these products will not lose market
exclusivity in the U.S. before the end of 2023, and it is likely that
exclusivity will extend through May 2026.

Unless otherwise noted, the patents in the above charts are compound patents.
Each patent may be subject to a future patent term restoration of up to five
years and six month pediatric market exclusivity, either or both of which may
be available. In addition, depending on the circumstances surrounding any
final regulatory approval of the compound, there may be other listed patents
or patent applications pending that could have relevance to the product as
finally approved; the relevance of any such application would depend upon the
claims that ultimately may be granted and the nature of the final regulatory
approval of the product. Also, regulatory exclusivity tied to the protection
of clinical data is complementary to patent protection and, in some cases, may
provide more effective or longer lasting marketing exclusivity than a
compound's patent estate. In the U.S., the data protection generally runs five
years from first marketing approval of a new chemical entity, extended to
seven years for an orphan drug indication and 12 years from first marketing
approval of a biological product.

While the expiration of a compound patent normally results in a loss of market
exclusivity for the covered pharmaceutical product, commercial benefits may
continue to be derived from: (i) later-expiring patents on processes and
intermediates related to the most economical method of manufacture of the
active ingredient of such product; (ii) patents relating to the use of such
product; (iii) patents relating to novel compositions and formulations; and
(iv) in the U.S. and certain other countries, market exclusivity that may be
available under relevant law. The effect of product patent expiration on
pharmaceutical products also depends upon many other factors such as the
nature of the market and the position of the product in it, the growth of the
market, the complexities and economics of the process for manufacture of the
active ingredient of the product and the requirements of new drug provisions
of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or similar laws and regulations in
other countries.

Additions to market exclusivity are sought in the U.S. and other countries
through all relevant laws, including laws increasing patent life. Some of the
benefits of increases in patent life have been partially offset by an increase
in the number of incentives for and use of generic products. Additionally,
improvements in intellectual property laws are sought in the U.S. and other
countries through reform of patent and other relevant laws and implementation
of international treaties.

"Risk Factors" and Item 8\. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"
Note 11\. "Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities" below.

Worldwide, all of the Company's important products are sold under trademarks
that are considered in the aggregate to be of material importance. Trademark
protection continues in some countries as long as used; in other countries, as
long as registered. Registration is for fixed terms and can be renewed
indefinitely.

Royalty income in 2022 on patent and know-how licenses and other rights
amounted to $537 million. Merck also incurred royalty expenses amounting to
$3.0 billion in 2022 under patent and know-how licenses it holds.

Research and Development

The Company's business is characterized by the introduction of new products or
new uses for existing products through a strong research and development
program. At December 31, 2022, approximately 19,200 people were employed in
the Company's research activities. The Company prioritizes its research and
development efforts and focuses on candidates that it believes represent
breakthrough science for unmet medical needs that will make a difference for
patients and payers.

The Company maintains a number of long-term exploratory and fundamental
research programs in biology and chemistry as well as research programs
directed toward product development. The Company's research and development
model is designed to increase productivity and improve the probability of
success by prioritizing the Company's research and development resources on
candidates the Company believes are capable of providing unambiguous,
promotable advantages to patients and payers and delivering the maximum value
of its approved medicines and vaccines through new indications and new
formulations. Merck is pursuing emerging product opportunities independent of
therapeutic area or modality (small molecule, biologics and vaccines) and is
building its biologics capabilities. The Company is committed to ensuring that
externally sourced programs remain an important component of its pipeline
strategy, with a focus on supplementing its internal research through
acquisitions as well as a licensing and external alliance strategy focused on
the entire spectrum of collaborations from early research to late-stage
compounds, as well as access to new technologies.

The Company's clinical pipeline includes candidates in multiple disease areas,
including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases, infectious
diseases, neurosciences, respiratory diseases, and vaccines.

In the development of human health products, industry practice and government
regulations in the U.S. and most foreign countries provide for the
determination of effectiveness and safety of new chemical compounds through
preclinical tests and controlled clinical evaluation. Before a new drug or
vaccine may be marketed in the U.S., recorded data on preclinical and clinical
experience are included in the New Drug Application (NDA) for a drug or the
Biologics License Application (BLA) for a vaccine or biologic submitted to the
FDA for the required approval.

Once the Company's scientists discover a new small molecule compound or
biologic that they believe has promise to treat a medical condition, the
Company commences preclinical testing with that compound. Preclinical testing
includes laboratory testing and animal safety studies to gather data on
chemistry, pharmacology, immunogenicity and toxicology. Pending acceptable
preclinical data, the Company will initiate clinical testing in accordance
with established regulatory requirements. The clinical testing begins with
Phase 1 studies, which are designed to assess safety, tolerability,
pharmacokinetics, and preliminary pharmacodynamic activity of the compound in
humans. If favorable, additional, larger Phase 2 studies are initiated to
determine the efficacy of the compound in the affected population, define
appropriate dosing for the compound, as well as identify any adverse effects
that could limit the compound's usefulness. In some situations, the clinical
program incorporates adaptive design methodology to use accumulating data to
decide how to modify aspects of the ongoing clinical study as it continues,
without undermining the validity and integrity of the trial. One type of
adaptive clinical trial is an adaptive Phase 2a/2b trial design, a two-stage
trial design consisting of a Phase 2a proof-of-concept stage and a Phase 2b
dose-optimization finding stage. If data from the Phase 2 trials are
satisfactory, the Company commences large-scale Phase 3 trials to confirm the
compound's efficacy and safety. Another type of adaptive clinical trial is an
adaptive Phase 2/3 trial design, a study that includes an interim analysis and
an adaptation that changes the trial from having features common in a Phase 2
study (e.g., multiple dose groups) to a design similar to a Phase 3 trial. An
adaptive Phase 2/3 trial design reduces timelines by eliminating activities
which would be required to start a separate study. Upon completion of Phase 3
trials, if satisfactory, the Company submits regulatory filings with the
appropriate regulatory agencies around the world to have the product candidate
approved for marketing. There can be no assurance that a compound that is the
result of any particular program will obtain the regulatory approvals
necessary for it to be marketed.

Vaccine development follows the same general pathway as for drugs. Preclinical
testing focuses on the vaccine's safety and ability to elicit a protective
immune response (immunogenicity). Pre-marketing vaccine clinical trials are
typically done in three phases. Initial Phase 1 clinical studies are conducted
in normal subjects to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of
the vaccine candidate. Phase 2 studies are dose-ranging studies and provide
additional data on safety, immunogenicity and/or effectiveness. Finally, Phase
3 trials are conducted in the intended population for licensure and provide
data on immunogenicity and/or effectiveness, as well as safety, to support
applications for regulatory approvals. If successful, the Company submits
regulatory filings with the appropriate regulatory agencies.

In the U.S., the FDA review process begins once a complete NDA or BLA is
submitted, received and accepted for review by the agency. Within 60 days
after receipt, the FDA determines if the application is sufficiently complete
to permit a substantive review. The FDA also assesses, at that time, whether
the application will be granted

14

Table of Contents

a priority review or standard review. Pursuant to the Prescription Drug User
Fee Act V (PDUFA), the FDA review period target for NDAs or original BLAs is
either six months, for priority review, or ten months, for a standard review,
from the time the application is deemed sufficiently complete. Once the review
timelines are determined, the FDA will generally act upon the application
within those timelines, unless a major amendment has been submitted (either at
the Company's own initiative or the FDA's request) to the pending application.
If this occurs, the FDA may extend the review period to allow for review of
the new information, but by no more than three months. Extensions to the
review period are communicated to the Company. The FDA can act on an
application either by issuing an approval letter or by issuing a Complete
Response Letter (CRL) stating that the application will not be approved in its
present form and describing all deficiencies that the FDA has identified.
Should the Company wish to pursue an application after receiving a CRL, it can
resubmit the application with information that addresses the questions or
issues identified by the FDA in order to support approval. Resubmissions are
subject to review period targets, which vary depending on the underlying
submission type and the content of the resubmission.

The FDA has four program designations -- Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy,
Accelerated Approval, and Priority Review -- to facilitate and expedite
development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the
treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. The Fast Track
designation provides pharmaceutical manufacturers with opportunities for
frequent interactions with FDA reviewers during the product's development and
the ability for the manufacturer to do a rolling submission of the NDA/BLA. A
rolling submission allows completed portions of the application to be
submitted and reviewed by the FDA on an ongoing basis. The Breakthrough
Therapy designation provides manufacturers with all of the features of the
Fast Track designation as well as intensive guidance on implementing an
efficient development program for the product and a commitment by the FDA to
involve senior managers and experienced staff in the review. The Accelerated
Approval designation allows the FDA to approve a product based on an effect on
a surrogate or intermediate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a
product's clinical benefit and generally requires the manufacturer to conduct
required post-approval confirmatory trials to verify the clinical benefit. The
Priority Review designation means that the FDA's goal is to take action on the
NDA/BLA within six months, compared to ten months under standard review. More
than one of these special designations can be granted for a given application
(i.e., a product designated as a Breakthrough Therapy may also be eligible for
Priority Review).

Due to the COVID-19 public health crisis, the U.S. Secretary of Health and
Human Services has exercised statutory authority to determine that a public
health emergency exists, and declared these circumstances justify the
emergency use of drugs and biological products as authorized by the FDA. While
in effect, this declaration enables the FDA to issue Emergency Use
Authorizations (EUAs) permitting distribution and use of specific medical
products absent NDA/BLA submission or approval, including products to treat or
prevent diseases or conditions caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, subject to the
terms of any such EUAs. The FDA must make certain findings to grant an EUA,
including that it is reasonable to believe based on the totality of evidence
that the drug or biologic may be effective, and that known or potential
benefits when used under the terms of the EUA outweigh known or potential
risks. Additionally, the FDA must find that there is no adequate, approved and
available alternative to the emergency use of the authorized drug or biologic.
The FDA may revise or revoke an EUA if the circumstances justifying its
issuance no longer exist, the criteria for its issuance are no longer met, or
other circumstances make a revision or revocation appropriate to protect the
public health or safety.

The primary method the Company uses to obtain marketing authorization of
pharmaceutical products in the EU is through the "centralized procedure." This
procedure is compulsory for certain pharmaceutical products, in particular
those using biotechnological processes, and is also available for certain new
chemical compounds and products. A company seeking to market an innovative
pharmaceutical product through the centralized procedure must file a complete
set of safety data and efficacy data as part of a Marketing Authorization
Application (MAA) with the European Medicines Agency (EMA). After the EMA
evaluates the MAA, it provides a recommendation to the EC and the EC then
approves or denies the MAA. It is also possible for new chemical products to
obtain marketing authorization in the EU through a "mutual recognition
procedure" in which an application is made to a single member state and, if
the member state approves the pharmaceutical product under a national
procedure, the applicant may submit that approval to the mutual recognition
procedure of some or all other EU Member States.

Outside of the U.S. and the EU, the Company submits marketing applications to
national regulatory authorities. Examples of such are the Ministry of Health,
Labour and Welfare in Japan, the National Medical Products Administration in
China, Health Canada, Agencia Nacional de Vigilancia Sanataria in Brazil,
Korea Food and Drug Administration in South Korea, and the Therapeutic Goods
Administration in Australia. Each country has a separate and independent
review process and timeline. In many markets, approval times can be longer as
the regulatory authority requires approval in a major market, such as the U.S.
or the EU, and issuance of a Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product from that
market before initiating their local review process.

Research and Development Update

The Company currently has several candidates under regulatory review in the
U.S. and internationally or in late-stage clinical development.

MK-4482, Lagevrio, is an investigational oral antiviral medicine for the
treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at risk for
progressing to severe disease. Merck is developing Lagevrio in collaboration
with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP (Ridgeback). The FDA granted Emergency Use
Authorization (EUA) for Lagevrio in December 2021; last issued in February
2023, to authorize Lagevrio for the treatment of adults with a current
diagnosis of mild-to-moderate COVID-19, and who are at high risk for
progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, and for
whom alternative COVID-19 treatment options approved or authorized by the FDA
are not accessible or clinically appropriate. The authorization is based on
the Phase 3 MOVe-OUT trial. Lagevrio is not approved for any use in the U.S.
and is authorized only for the duration of the declaration that circumstances
exist justifying the authorization of its emergency use under the Food, Drug
and Cosmetic Act, unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner. In
November 2021, the EMA issued a positive scientific opinion for Lagevrio,
which is intended to support national decision-making on the possible use of
Lagevrio prior to marketing authorization. In October 2021, the EMA initiated
a rolling review for Lagevrio for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults. On
February 24, 2023, Merck and Ridgeback announced that the Committee for
Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA has recommended the refusal
of the marketing authorization for Lagevrio. Merck and Ridgeback will appeal
the decision and request a re-examination of the CHMP's opinion. Applications
to other regulatory bodies worldwide are underway.

In October 2022, Merck provided an update on new clinical and non-clinical
studies of Lagevrio. A preliminary analysis of the University of Oxford's
PANORAMIC study, conducted in the UK in highly-vaccinated adults mostly over
65 years of age, showed no evidence of a difference between Lagevrio added to
usual care compared to usual care alone for the reduction of hospitalizations
and deaths through Day 28 (primary endpoint was not met); the incidence of
hospitalizations and death through Day 28 was very low overall. The main
secondary endpoint (time to first self-reported recovery) in the PANORAMIC
study was 6 days shorter with the Lagevrio group compared to the usual care
group; in addition, the use of Lagevrio also was associated with earlier
recovery across a wide range of other symptom measures, as compared to the
usual care group. Additionally, an analysis of real-world data from a separate
study conducted by investigators in Israel (known as the Clalit study) showed
that in a cohort of non-hospitalized, high-risk patients, Lagevrio reduced
hospitalizations and mortality due to COVID-19 in patients 65 years and above;
no evidence of benefit was found in younger adults ages 40 to 64 years. Also,
Merck reported results from a separate, non-clinical 6-month carcinogenicity
study in transgenic mice, which demonstrated that Lagevrio was not
carcinogenic at any dose tested.

MK-7264, gefapixant, is an investigational, orally administered, selective
P2X3 receptor antagonist, for the treatment of refractory chronic cough or
unexplained chronic cough in adults under review by the FDA and the EMA. The
marketing applications for gefapixant are based on results from the COUGH-1
and COUGH-2 clinical trials. In January 2022, the FDA issued a Complete
Response Letter (CRL) regarding Merck's NDA for gefapixant. In the CRL, the
FDA requested additional information related to the cough counting system that
was used to assess efficacy. The CRL was not related to the safety of
gefapixant. The Company is performing additional analyses and anticipates
submitting this information to the FDA in the first half of 2023 in response
to the CRL. The review period in the EU has been extended pending the receipt
of additional information from the Company. Merck plans to submit the
information to the EMA in the first half of 2023.

MK-3475, Keytruda, is an anti-PD-1 therapy approved for the treatment of many
cancers that is in clinical development for expanded indications. These
approvals were the result of a broad clinical development program that
currently consists of more than 1,650 clinical trials, including more than
1,200 trials that combine Keytruda with other cancer treatments. These studies
encompass more than 30 cancer types including: biliary, estrogen receptor
positive breast cancer, cervical, colorectal, cutaneous squamous cell,
endometrial, esophageal, gastric, glioblastoma, head and neck, hepatocellular,
Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, non-small-cell lung, small-cell lung,
melanoma, mesothelioma, ovarian, prostate, renal, triple-negative breast, and
urothelial, many of which are currently in Phase 3 clinical development.
Further trials are being planned for other cancers.

Keytruda is under review by the FDA for the treatment of patients with
previously treated advanced HCC. This submission is based on data from the
Phase 3 KEYNOTE-394 trial along with supportive data from the KEYNOTE-240 and
KEYNOTE-224 trials. Keytruda is approved for this indication in the U.S. under
the FDA's accelerated approval process. This submission is to convert the
accelerated approval to full (regular) approval.

Keytruda is under priority review by the FDA for use in combination with
Padcev (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) for the treatment of certain patients with
locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who are not eligible to
receive cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. The FDA set a PDUFA date of April
21, 2023 for the supplemental BLAs

16

for Keytruda and Pedcev. The combination regimen was granted Breakthrough
Therapy designation by the FDA in February 2020. The applications are
supported by efficacy and safety data from the Phase 1b/2 EV-103 trial (also
known as KEYNOTE-869) Dose Escalation/Cohort A and Cohort K. Results from Dose
Escalation/Cohort A were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.
Results from Cohort K were presented in a late-breaking session at the 2022
European Society for Medical Oncology Congress.

Keytruda is also under review by the FDA for the treatment of adult and
pediatric patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic Merkel cell
carcinoma. This submission is based on data from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-913
trial. Keytruda is approved for this indication in the U.S. under the FDA's
accelerated approval process. This submission is to convert the accelerated
approval to full (regular) approval.

Additionally, Keytruda is under review by the FDA for the treatment of adult
and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic microsatellite
instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) solid tumors, as
determined by an FDA-approved test, that have progressed following prior
treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. This
submission is based on data from the Phase 2 KEYNOTE-158 trial along with
supportive data from the KEYNOTE-164 and KEYNOTE-051 trials. Keytruda is
approved for this indication in the U.S. under the FDA's accelerated approval
process. This submission is to convert the accelerated approval to full
(regular) approval.

Keytruda is under review in the EU for the adjuvant treatment of patients with
stage IB (≥4 cm), II or IIIA NSCLC following complete surgical resection. The
submission is based on data from the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-091 trial, also
known as EORTC-1416-LCG/ETOP-8-15 - PEARLS.

Keytruda is under review in Japan for the treatment of patients with relapsed
or refractory PMBLC. This submission is based on data from the Phase 2
KEYNOTE-170 study and the Phase 1 KEYNOTE-A33 study.

In January 2023, Merck announced that it will stop the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-991
trial investigating Keytruda in combination with enzalutamide and androgen
deprivation therapy (ADT) for the treatment of patients with metastatic
hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Merck is discontinuing the study based on
the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) which
reviewed data from a planned interim analysis. At the interim analysis,
Keytruda in combination with enzalutamide and ADT did not demonstrate an
improvement in overall survival or radiographic progression-free survival, the
trial's dual primary endpoints, compared to placebo plus enzalutamide and ADT.
Data from this study will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.

MK-7339, Lynparza, is an oral PARP inhibitor currently approved for certain
types of advanced or recurrent ovarian, early or metastatic breast, metastatic
pancreatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers being co-
developed for multiple cancer types as part of a collaboration with
AstraZeneca PLC.

In August 2022, the FDA granted priority review for a supplemental NDA for
Lynparza in combination with abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone for
the treatment of adult patients with mCRPC. The supplemental NDA was based on
results from the Phase 3 PROpel trial, which were presented at the 2022
American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancers Symposium and
later published in NEJM Evidence. The FDA initially set a PDUFA date in the
fourth quarter of 2022, but in December 2022 the FDA extended the PDUFA date
by three months to provide further time for the full review of the submission.
Lynparza is also under review in Japan for the treatment of certain patients
with mCRPC based on the PROpel trial.

MK-7902, Lenvima, is an oral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor being
developed as part of a collaboration with Eisai Co., Ltd. (Eisai). Merck and
Eisai are studying the Keytruda plus Lenvima combination through the LEAP
(LEnvatinib And Pembrolizumab) clinical program that includes studies across
13 different tumor types (biliary cancer, CRC, endometrial carcinoma,
esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, HCC, HNSCC, melanoma, pancreatic cancer,
prostate cancer, NSCLC, small-cell-lung cancer (SCLC) and RCC).

The Company also has several other programs in Phase 3 clinical development.

MK-1308A is the coformulation of quavonlimab, Merck's novel investigational
anti-CTLA-4 antibody, with pembrolizumab being evaluated for the treatment of
RCC.

Subcutaneous MK-3475, pembrolizumab, is being evaluated for comparability with
the intravenous formulation of pembrolizumab in NSCLC.

Subcutaneous MK-3475A, the coformulation of pembrolizumab with hyaluronidase,
is being evaluated for comparability with the intravenous formulation of
pembrolizumab in NSCLC.

MK-4280A is the coformulation of favezelimab, Merck's novel investigational
anti-LAG3 therapy, with pembrolizumab, being evaluated for the treatment of
CRC and hematological malignancies.

MK-6482, Welireg (belzutifan), is a hypoxia-inducible factor-2α (HIF-2α)
inhibitor being evaluated for a supplemental indication for the treatment of
patients with RCC.

MK-7119, Tukysa (tucatinib), is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor,
for the treatment of HER2-positive cancers in development for the treatment of
breast cancer and colorectal cancer. In September 2020, Seagen granted Merck
an exclusive license and entered into a co-development agreement with Merck to
accelerate the global reach of Tukysa.

MK-7684A is the coformulation of vibostolimab, an anti-TIGIT therapy, with
pembrolizumab being evaluated for the treatment of melanoma, NSCLC and SCLC.

In December 2021, Merck announced that the FDA had placed clinical holds on
the investigational new drug applications for islatravir (MK-8591) programs
that were in development for the treatment and prevention of HIV-1 infection.
The FDA's clinical hold was based on observations of decreases in total
lymphocyte and CD4+ T-cell counts in some participants receiving islatravir in
clinical studies. In September 2022, Merck announced it will initiate a new
doravirine/islatravir (MK-8591A) Phase 3 clinical program for the treatment of
people with HIV-1 infection. These new Phase 3 studies will evaluate a once-
daily oral combination of doravirine 100 mg and a lower dose of islatravir in
previously untreated adults and as a switch in antiretroviral therapy in
virologically suppressed adults with HIV-1 infection. The Phase 2 clinical
trial evaluating an investigational oral once-weekly combination treatment
regimen of islatravir and Gilead Sciences' lenacapavir in adults with HIV-1
infection who are virologically suppressed will resume under an amended
protocol with a lower dose of islatravir. The investigational NDA for the
islatravir + lenacapavir once-weekly treatment regimen remains under a partial
clinical hold for any studies that would use weekly oral islatravir doses
higher than the doses considered for the revised clinical program.
Additionally, Merck announced it will discontinue the development of once-
monthly oral islatravir for PrEP. The Company remains committed to developing
compounds for long-acting HIV prevention and believes in the potential of the
nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor (NRTTI) mechanism. A
Phase 1b study in adults with HIV-1 infection assessing MK-8527, a novel NRTTI
candidate, will commence shortly.

V116 is an investigational 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) for
treatment of pneumococcal infection in adults. In June 2022, Merck announced
the presentation of positive results from a Phase 1/2 study evaluating the
safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of V116 in pneumococcal vaccine-naive
adults 18-49 years of age (Phase 1) and 50 years of age and older (Phase 2).
In both populations, V116 met the primary immunogenicity objectives and was
well-tolerated with an overall safety profile generally comparable to
Pneumovax 23 across age groups. In April 2022, Merck announced that V116
received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA for the prevention of
invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia caused by
Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 3, 6A/C, 7F, 8, 9N, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15A,
15B/C, 16F, 17F, 19A, 20, 22F, 23A, 23B, 24F, 31, 33F, 35B in adults 18 years
of age and older. Phase 3 trials evaluating V116 are ongoing.

MK-7962, sotatercept, is an investigational activin receptor type IIA-Fc
fusion protein being evaluated as an add-on to stable background therapy for
the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Sotatercept was
obtained in connection with Merck's acquisition of Acceleron Pharma Inc. in
2021. In October 2022, Merck announced positive top-line results from the
pivotal Phase 3 STELLAR trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of
sotatercept for the treatment of PAH (World Health Organization [WHO] Group
1). The trial met its primary efficacy outcome measure, demonstrating a
statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in 6-minute
walk distance (6MWD, which measures how far patients can walk in 6 minutes).
Eight of nine secondary efficacy outcome measures achieved statistical
significance, including the outcome measure of proportion of participants
achieving multicomponent improvement (defined as improvement in 6MWD,
improvement in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level, and either
improvement in WHO Functional Class [FC] or maintenance of WHO FC II), and the
outcome measure of time to death or the first occurrence of a clinical
worsening event. The Cognitive/Emotional Impacts domain score of PAH-SYMPACT,
which was assessed as the ninth and final secondary outcome measure, did not
achieve statistical significance. Results will be presented at the upcoming
American College of Cardiology Annual Scientific Session. The Company
anticipates filing sotatercept with regulatory authorities in 2023.

MK-1654, clesrovimab, is a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) monoclonal
antibody that is being evaluated for the prevention of RSV medically attended
lower respiratory tract infection in infants and certain children over 1 year
of age. Two Phase 3 trials are currently enrolling.

In October 2022, Merck and Royalty Pharma plc (Royalty Pharma) entered into a
funding arrangement under which Royalty Pharma paid Merck $50 million to co-
fund Merck's development costs for a Phase 2b trial of MK-8189, an
investigational oral phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) inhibitor, which is being
evaluated for the treatment of schizophrenia. Under the agreement, Royalty
Pharma has no rights to MK-8189 and has no decision-making authority over the
program. If Merck elects to advance MK-8189 into a Phase 3 study, Royalty
Pharma has the option to provide additional funding of 50% of the development
costs up to $375 million for the Phase 3 trial. If

such additional funding is provided, Royalty Pharma becomes eligible to
receive future regulatory milestone payments contingent upon certain marketing
approvals, as well as royalties.

The charts below reflect the Company's research pipeline as of February 17,

respectively, in 2022 and 2021.

The Company recognizes that its employees are critical to meet the needs of
its patients and customers and that its ability to excel depends on the
integrity, skill, and diversity of its employees.

(1) Third party contractors include the Company's temporary workers,
independent contractors, and freelancers who are viewed as full-time
equivalent employees. They exclude outsourced service providers.

Talent Acquisition

The Company uses a comprehensive approach to ensure recruiting, retention and
leadership development goals are systematically executed throughout the
Company and that it hires talented leaders to achieve improved gender parity
and representation across all dimensions of diversity. The Company provides
training to its

20

* * *

Table of Contents

managers and external recruiting organizations on strategies to mitigate
unconscious bias in the candidate selection and hiring process. In addition,
the Company utilizes a comprehensive communications strategy, employee
branding and marketing outreach, social media and strategic alliance
partnerships to reach a broad pool of talent in its critical business areas.
In 2022, the Company hired approximately 8,900 employees across the globe
through various channels including the Company's external career site, direct
passive candidate sourcing, diversity partnerships, employee referrals,
universities and other external sources.

Global Diversity and Inclusion

Diversity and inclusion are fundamental to the Company's success and core to
future innovation. The Company fosters a globally diverse and inclusive
workforce for its employees by creating an environment of belonging,
engagement, equity, and empowerment. The Company is proactive and intentional
about diversity hiring and development programs to advance talent. The Company
creates competitive advantages by leveraging diversity and inclusion to
accelerate business performance. This includes fostering global supplier
diversity, integrating diversity and inclusion into the Company's
commercialization strategies and leveraging employee insights to improve
performance. In addition to these efforts, the Company has ten Employee
Business Resource Groups that provide opportunities for employees to take an
active part in contributing to the Company's inclusive culture through their
work in talent acquisition and development, business and customer insights and
social and community outreach.

The Company's diversity goals include increasing representation in senior

Compensation and Benefits

The Company provides a valuable suite of compensation and benefits programs
that reflect its commitment to attract, retain and motivate its talent, and
support its employees and their families in every stage of life. The Company
continuously monitors and adjusts its compensation and benefit programs to
ensure they are competitive, contemporary, helpful and engaging, and that they
support strategic imperatives such as diversity and inclusion, equity,
flexibility, quality, security and affordability. For example, the Company
regularly monitors and evaluates its pay practices and policies to ensure that
it is paying employees equitably across all genders, races and ethnicities.
The Company offers a personal health care concierge service to assist U.S.
employees participating in the Company medical plan with their health care
needs. Aligned with its business and in support of its cancer care strategy,
the Company provides enhanced cancer screening benefits with cash incentives,
immediate access to a leading cancer center of excellence for U.S. employees
and high value cancer support resources (e.g., caregiving and mental health)
for employees and their families. Globally, the Company implemented a minimum
standard of 12 weeks of paid parental leave, which inclusively applies to all
parents. In the U.S., the Company's benefits rank in the top quartile of
Fortune 100 companies under the Aon 2022 Benefits Index. The Company has been
included in the

21

Seramount (previously the Working Mother) 100 Best Companies ranking for 36
consecutive years and was named a top ten Best Company for Moms in 2022.

Employee Well-being

The Company is committed to helping its employees and their families improve
their own health and well-being, whether physical, mental, financial, or
social. The Company's programs ensure quality, competitive value, protection
from significant financial hardship and access to tools and resources to
support employees and their families in all stages of their career and their
lives, winning the Company awards such as the Best Employers Excellence in
Health & Well-being from the Business Group on Health 2022. The Company
fosters an array of flexible work arrangements that includes flextime, summer
hours, remote work, telework, job sharing and part-time work to help employees
succeed personally as well as professionally. As part of the Company's overall
culture of well-being, it also offers onsite services so employees can thrive.
For example, in the U.S., these include onsite health care professionals at
many major sites, cafeterias committed to healthy menu offerings, onsite
childcare, onsite gyms, and the convenient option to bank through its two
employee credit unions.

COVID-19 Response

The Company recognizes that it has a unique responsibility to help in response
to the COVID-19 pandemic and is committed to supporting and protecting its
employees and their families, ensuring that its supply of medicines and
vaccines reaches its patients, contributing its scientific expertise to the
development of antiviral approaches and supporting its health care providers
and the communities in which they serve. The Company continues to provide
employees with easy and regular access to information, including guidance
around hygiene measures and travel and how to best collaborate via the
Company's hybrid work model. Examples of pandemic support resources and
programs available to the Company's employees include pay continuation for
workers who have been sick or exposed, an updated policy that enables
employees with medical backgrounds to volunteer in SARS-CoV-2-related
activities, resources to prioritize physical and mental wellness, adjustments
to medical plans to cover 100% of a COVID-19-related diagnosis, testing and
treatment, childcare resources and more.

Engaging Employees

The Company strives to foster employee engagement by promoting a safe,
positive, diverse, and inclusive work environment that provides numerous
opportunities for two-way communication with employees. Some of the Company's
key programs and initiatives include promoting global employee engagement
surveys, ongoing pulse checks to the organization for interim feedback on
specific topics, fostering professional networking and collaboration,
identifying and providing opportunities for volunteering and establishing
positive, cooperative business relations with designated employee
representatives.

Talent Management and Development

As the Company pursues its goal of becoming the world's premier research-based
biopharmaceutical company, there is a consistent focus on the importance of
continuously developing its diverse and talented people. The Company is
committed to talent growth for all, allowing its employees to move more
fluidly across the organization, unlocking an environment that allows them to
shape their career pathways via non-linear and inclusive opportunities and
experience. Merck's current talent management system supports company-wide
performance management, leadership development, talent reviews and succession
planning. Annual performance reviews help further the professional development
of the Company's employees and ensure that the Company's workforce is aligned
with the Company's objectives. The Company seeks to continuously build the
skills and capabilities of its workforce to accelerate talent, improve
performance and mitigate risk through relevant continuous learning
experiences. This includes, but is not limited to, building leadership and
management skills, as well as providing technical and functional training to
all employees.

Environmental Matters

Environmental Sustainability

The Company strives to be a strong environmental steward, and realizes that
its strategy and efforts need to continuously evolve in the face of a changing
climate. The Company's environmental sustainability strategy has three focus
areas:

•Driving operational efficiency;

•Designing new products to minimize environmental impact; and

•Reducing any impacts in the Company's upstream and downstream value chain.

A primary focus of the Company in each of these areas is on climate action.
Merck believes that climate change could present risks to its business, as
discussed in further detail in Item 1A. "Risk Factors" under the

22

* * *

Table of Contents

headings "Climate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address
climate change may negatively affect the Company's business, results of
operations, cash flows and prospects" and "Environmental, social and
governance (ESG) matters may impact the Company's business and reputation."
Some of the potential impacts of climate change to the Company's business
include increased operating costs due to additional regulatory requirements,
physical risks to the Company's facilities, water limitations and disruptions
to its supply chain. These potential risks are integrated into the Company's
business planning, including investment in reducing energy usage, water use
and greenhouse gas emissions.

In 2021, the Company's Scope 1, 2 and 3, reduction targets were verified by
the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). The Company has made progress
toward its climate goals and aspires to meet and exceed the evolving
expectations of its stakeholders and employees. These goals include achieving
carbon neutrality for greenhouse gas emissions across operations (Scopes 1 and
2) by 2025, reducing Scope 1 and 2 operational greenhouse gas emissions 46% by
2030 (from a 2019 baseline), reducing Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 30%
by 2030 (from a 2019 baseline), and sourcing 100% of its purchased electricity
from renewables by 2025. Other environmental sustainability initiatives of the
Company include:

•Low Carbon Transition Playbook. In 2021, the Company launched its Low Carbon
Transition Playbook, a tool intended to help create a site strategy by
identifying gaps, uncovering opportunities and creating a common platform for
assessment of levers and resource deployment across a range of sustainability
initiatives. It also details how employees and stakeholders can accelerate the
Company's environmental work, along with explanations of the collective
benefits of these actions for the business and for stakeholders. Functions
across the Company are expected to take advantage of this document to
strategize and develop new ways to meet many of the Company's broader
sustainability goals and streamline the Company's tracking and reporting of
specific metrics and categories.

•Waste Diversion Playbook. In 2022, the Company created its Waste Diversion
Playbook, which is a tool, similar to the Low Carbon Transition Playbook, to
help sites self-assess and develop their waste diversion strategies to achieve
the Company's corporate waste goals. The objectives are to identify and
prioritize the most effective and least resource intensive actions, improve
tracking and reporting and generate knowledge sharing between sites.

•Partnering for progress across the Company's value chain. The Company is a
signatory to Schneider Electric's Energize program, a pioneering collaboration
to help pharmaceutical and health care suppliers address their own operational
Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions through green power procurement, which in
turn is intended to help the signatories reduce their Scope 3 emissions.

•Product stewardship and green and sustainable science. The Company's product
stewardship program focuses on identifying and either preventing or minimizing
potential safety and environmental hazards throughout a product's life cycle.
The Company is also committed to understanding, managing and reducing the
environmental impacts of its products and the materials associated with
discovering and producing them. The Company's green and sustainable science
program uses a "green-by-design" approach. By using more efficient and
innovative processing methods and technologies, the Company is reducing the
amount of energy, water and raw materials the Company uses to make the
Company's products, thereby reducing the amount of waste the Company generates
and lowering the Company's production costs.

Management does not believe that expenditures related to these initiatives
should have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition,
results of operations, liquidity or capital resources for any year.

Environmental Regulation and Remediation

The Company believes that there are no compliance issues associated with
applicable environmental laws and regulations that would have a material
adverse effect on the Company. The Company is also remediating environmental
contamination resulting from past industrial activity at certain of its sites.
Expenditures for remediation and environmental liabilities were $4 million in
2022 and are estimated to be $23 million in the aggregate for the years 2023
through 2027. These amounts do not consider potential recoveries from other
parties. The Company has taken an active role in identifying and accruing for
these costs and, in management's opinion, the liabilities for all
environmental matters that are probable and reasonably estimable have been
accrued and totaled $39 million and $40 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the
outcome of these matters, or the ultimate costs of remediation, management
does not believe that any reasonably possible expenditures that may be
incurred in excess of the liabilities accrued should exceed approximately $35
million in the aggregate. Management also does not believe that these
expenditures should have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial
condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources for any year.

The Company's worldwide business is subject to risks of currency fluctuations,
governmental actions and other governmental proceedings abroad. The Company
does not regard these risks as a deterrent to further expansion of its
operations abroad. However, the Company closely reviews its methods of
operations and adopts strategies responsive to changing economic and political
conditions.

Merck has operations in countries located in Latin America, the Middle East,
Africa, Eastern Europe and Asia Pacific. Business in these developing areas,

Item 1A.Risk Factors.

Summary Risk Factors

The Company is subject to a number of risks that if realized could materially
adversely affect its business, results of operations, cash flow, financial
condition or prospects. The following is a summary of the principal risk
factors facing the Company:

•The Company is dependent on its patent rights, and if its patent rights are
invalidated or circumvented, its business could be materially adversely
affected.

•As the Company's products lose market exclusivity, the Company generally
experiences a significant and rapid loss of sales from those products.

•Key products generate a significant amount of the Company's profits and cash
flows, and any events that adversely affect the markets for its leading
products could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of
operations and financial condition. The Company expects that sales of
Lagevrio, which were $5.7 billion in 2022, will decline significantly to
approximately $1.0 billion in 2023.

•The Company's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing
commercially successful products and the Company may not be able to acquire
commercially successful products in other ways; in consequence, the Company
may not be able to replace sales of successful products that lose patent
protection.

•The Company's success is dependent on the successful development and
marketing of new products, which are subject to substantial risks.

•The Company faces continued pricing pressure with respect to its products.

•Unfavorable or uncertain economic conditions, together with cost-reduction
measures being taken by certain governments, could negatively affect the
Company's operating results.

The above list is not exhaustive, and the Company faces additional challenges
and risks. Investors should carefully consider all of the information set
forth in this Form 10-K, including the following risk factors, before deciding
to invest in any of the Company's securities.

Risk Factors

The risks below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks not
currently known to the Company or that the Company presently deems immaterial
may also impair its business operations. The Company's business, financial
condition, results of operations, cash flow or prospects could be materially
adversely affected by any of these risks. This Form 10-K also contains
forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company's
results could materially differ from those anticipated in these forward-
looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks it
faces described below and elsewhere. See "Cautionary Factors that May Affect
Future Results" below.

Risks Related to the Company's Business

The Company is dependent on its patent rights, and if its patent rights are
invalidated or circumvented, its business could be materially adversely
affected.

Patent protection is considered, in the aggregate, to be of material
importance to the Company's marketing of human health and animal health
products in the U.S. and in most major foreign markets. Patents covering
products that it has introduced normally provide market exclusivity, which is
important for the successful marketing and sale of its products. The Company
seeks patents covering each of its products in each of the markets where it
intends to sell the products and where meaningful patent protection is
available.

Even if the Company succeeds in obtaining patents covering its products, third
parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or
circumvent its patents and patent applications. It is important for the
Company's business to successfully assert and defend the patent rights that
provide market exclusivity for its products. The Company is often involved in
patent disputes relating to challenges to its patents or claims by third
parties of infringement against the Company. The Company asserts and defends
its patents both within and outside the U.S., including by filing claims of
infringement against other parties. See Item 8\. "Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data," Note 11\. "Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities"
below. In particular, manufacturers of generic or biosimilar pharmaceutical
products from time to time file abbreviated NDAs or BLAs with the FDA seeking
to market generic/biosimilar forms of the Company's products prior to the
expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by the Company. The Company
normally responds by asserting one or more of its patents with a lawsuit
alleging patent infringement. Patent litigation and other challenges to the
Company's patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive the Company of
market exclusivity for a patented product or, in some cases, third-party
patents may prevent the Company from marketing and selling a product in a
particular geographic area.

Additionally, certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory
licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies or in
other circumstances, which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from
those regions and negatively affect the Company's results of operations.
Further, court decisions relating to other companies' patents, potential
legislation in both the U.S. and certain foreign markets relating to patents,
as well as regulatory initiatives may result in a more general weakening of
intellectual property protection.

If one or more important products lose patent protection in profitable
markets, sales of those products are likely to decline significantly as a
result of generic versions of those products becoming available. The Company's
results of operations may be adversely affected by the lost sales unless and
until the Company has launched commercially successful products that replace
the lost sales. In addition, if products that were measured at fair value and
capitalized in connection with acquisitions experience difficulties in the
market that negatively affect product cash flows, the Company may recognize
material non-cash impairment charges with respect to the value of those
products.

A chart listing the patent protection for certain of the Company's marketed
products, and U.S. patent protection for candidates in Phase 3 clinical
development is set forth above in Item 1\. "Business -- Patents, Trademarks
and Licenses."

As the Company's products lose market exclusivity, the Company generally
experiences a significant and rapid loss of sales from those products.

The Company depends upon patents to provide it with exclusive marketing rights
for its products for some period of time. Loss of patent protection for one of
the Company's products typically leads to a significant and rapid loss of
sales for that product as lower priced generic versions of that drug become
available. In the case of products that contribute significantly to the
Company's sales, the loss of market exclusivity can have a material adverse
effect on the Company's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects. While the key U.S.

26

patent for Januvia and Janumet claiming the sitagliptin compound expired in
January 2023, as a result of favorable court rulings and settlement agreements
related to a later expiring patent directed to the specific sitagliptin salt
form of the products, the Company expects that these products will not lose
market exclusivity in the U.S. until May 2026. However, certain of the rulings
are currently being appealed, and an unfavorable court decision would likely
cause the products to lose exclusivity in the U.S. toward the end of 2023. The
Company lost market exclusivity for Januvia in all of the EU and for Janumet
in some European countries in September 2022. Merck expects that exclusivity
for Janumet will be lost in other European countries in April 2023. While the
Company lost market exclusivity for Januvia in China in 2022 with the approval
of a generic equivalent product, the impact on sales in 2023 is expected to be
modest. It is anticipated that a generic equivalent of Janumet will be
approved in China in the first quarter of 2023, but the impact to sales in
2023 is also expected to be modest. As these products lose exclusivity, the
Company anticipates that sales of Januvia and Janumet will decline
substantially.

Key products generate a significant amount of the Company's profits and cash
flows, and any events that adversely affect the markets for its leading
products could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of
operations and financial condition. The Company expects that sales of
Lagevrio, which were $5.7 billion in 2022, will decline significantly to
approximately $1.0 billion in 2023.

The Company's ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends
largely upon the continued profitability of the Company's key products, such
as Keytruda, Gardasil/Gardasil 9, Lynparza, Bravecto, and Bridion. As a result
of the Company's dependence on key products, any event that adversely affects
any of these products or the markets for any of these products could have a
significant adverse impact on results of operations and financial condition.
These events could include loss of patent protection, increased costs
associated with manufacturing, generic or over-the-counter availability of the
Company's product or a competitive product, the discovery of previously
unknown side effects, results of post-approval trials, increased competition
from the introduction of new, more effective treatments and discontinuation or
removal from the market of the product for any reason. Such events could have
a material adverse effect on the sales of any such products.

In particular, in 2022, sales of Lagevrio, which were $5.7 billion,
represented a substantial portion of the Company's revenue and profit growth.
The Company expects that sales of Lagevrio will decline significantly to
approximately $1.0 billion in 2023.

The Company's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing
commercially successful products and the Company may not be able to acquire
commercially successful products in other ways; in consequence, the Company
may not be able to replace sales of successful products that lose patent
protection.

In order to remain competitive, the Company, like other major pharmaceutical
companies, must continue to launch new products. Expected declines in sales of
products after the loss of market exclusivity mean that the Company's future
success is dependent on its pipeline of new products, including new products
that it may develop through collaborations and joint ventures and products
that it is able to obtain through license or acquisition. To accomplish this,
the Company commits substantial effort, funds and other resources to research
and development, both through its own dedicated resources and through various
collaborations with third parties. There is a high rate of failure inherent in
the research and development process for new drugs and vaccines. As a result,
there is a high risk that funds invested by the Company in research programs
will not generate financial returns. This risk profile is compounded by the
fact that this research has a long investment cycle. To bring a pharmaceutical
compound from the discovery phase to market may take a decade or more and
failure can occur at any point in the process, including later in the process
after significant funds have been invested.

For a description of the research and development process, see Item 1\.
"Business -- Research and Development" above. Each phase of testing is highly
regulated and during each phase there is a substantial risk that the Company
will encounter serious obstacles or will not achieve its goals. Therefore, the
Company may abandon a product in which it has invested substantial amounts of
time and resources. Some of the risks encountered in the research and
development process include the following: preclinical testing of a new
compound may yield disappointing results; competing products from other
manufacturers may reach the market first; clinical trials of a new drug may
not be successful; a new drug may not be effective or may have harmful side
effects; a new drug may not be approved by the regulators for its intended
use; it may not be possible to obtain a patent for a new drug; payers may
refuse to cover or reimburse the new product; or sales of a new product may be
disappointing.

The Company cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products
now under development will be approved or launched; whether it will be able to
develop, license or otherwise acquire compounds, product candidates or
products; or whether any products, once launched, will be commercially
successful. The Company must maintain a continuous flow of successful new
products and successful new indications for existing products

sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to
replace sales that are lost as profitable products lose market exclusivity or
are displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so in the
short term or long term would have a material adverse effect on the Company's
business, results of operations, cash flow, financial condition and prospects.

The Company's success is dependent on the successful development and marketing
of new products, which are subject to substantial risks.

Products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or
fail to succeed for numerous reasons, including the following:

•findings of ineffectiveness, superior safety or efficacy of competing
products, or harmful side effects in clinical or preclinical testing;

•failure to receive the necessary regulatory approvals, including delays in
the approval of new products and new indications, or the anticipated labeling,
and uncertainties about the time required to obtain regulatory approvals and
the benefit/risk standards applied by regulatory agencies in determining
whether to grant approvals;

•failure in certain markets to obtain reimbursement commensurate with the
level of innovation and clinical benefit presented by the product;

•lack of economic feasibility due to manufacturing costs or other factors; and

•preclusion from commercialization by the proprietary rights of others.

In the future, if certain pipeline programs are cancelled or if the Company
believes that their commercial prospects have been reduced, the Company may
recognize material non-cash impairment charges for those programs that were
measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with acquisitions or
certain collaborations.

Failure to successfully develop and market new products in the short term or
long term would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
results of operations, cash flow, financial condition and prospects.

The Company faces continued pricing pressure with respect to its products.

The Company faces continued pricing pressure globally and, particularly in
mature markets, from managed care organizations, government agencies and
programs that could negatively affect the Company's sales and profit margins.
In the U.S., these include (i) practices of managed care groups and
institutional and governmental purchasers, (ii) U.S. federal laws and
regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare
Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, the ACA, the
Inflation Reduction Act, and (iii) state activities aimed at increasing price
transparency, including new laws as noted above in Item 1. "Competition and
the Health Care Environment." Changes to the health care system enacted as
part of health care reform in the U.S., as well as increased purchasing power
of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector
beneficiaries, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, in the
U.S., larger customers have received higher rebates on drugs in certain highly
competitive categories. The Company must also compete to be placed on
formularies of managed care organizations. Exclusion of a product from a
formulary can lead to reduced usage in the managed care organization.

In order to provide information about the Company's pricing practices, the
Company annually posts on its website its Pricing Transparency Report for the
U.S. The report provides the Company's average annual list price and net price
increases across the Company's U.S. portfolio dating back to 2010. In 2022,
the Company's gross U.S. sales were reduced by 39.7% as a result of rebates,
discounts and returns.

Outside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU, Japan and China
have pervasive government involvement in funding health care and, in that
regard, fix the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and vaccine
products. Consequently, in those markets, the Company is subject to government
decision making and budgetary actions with respect to its products. In Japan,
the pharmaceutical industry is subject to government-mandated annual price
reductions of pharmaceutical products and certain vaccines. Furthermore, the
government can order re-pricing for specific products if it determines that
use of such product will exceed certain thresholds defined under applicable
re-pricing rules.

The Company expects pricing pressures to continue in the future.

Unfavorable or uncertain economic conditions, together with cost-reduction
measures being taken by certain governments, could negatively affect the
Company's operating results.

The Company's business may be adversely affected by local and global economic
conditions, including with respect to inflation, interest rates, and costs of
raw materials and packaging. Uncertainty in global economic and geopolitical
conditions may result in a slowdown to the global economy that could affect
the Company's business by reducing the prices that drug wholesalers and
retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers
may be able or willing to pay for the Company's products or by reducing the
demand for the Company's products, which could in turn negatively impact the
Company's sales and result in a material adverse effect on the Company's
business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

As discussed above in "Competition and the Health Care Environment," global
efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on
product pricing and market access worldwide. Changes to the U.S. health care
system as part of health care reform, as well as increased purchasing power of
entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector
beneficiaries, have contributed to pricing pressure. In several international
markets, government-mandated pricing actions have reduced prices of generic
and patented drugs. In addition, the Company's sales performance in 2022 was
negatively affected by other cost-reduction measures taken by governments and
other third parties to lower health care costs. The Company anticipates all of
these actions, and additional actions in the future, will negatively affect
sales and profits.

If credit and economic conditions worsen, the resulting economic and currency
impacts in the affected markets and globally could have a material adverse
effect on the Company's results.

As a result of global macroeconomic conditions, the Company is experiencing
some minor disruption and volatility in its global supply chain network. These
disruptions could increase in the future and cause delays in shipments of raw
materials and packaging, as well as related cost inflation. Any such
disruptions, delays or costs may result in the Company's inability to meet
demand for the Company's products.

The Company faces intense competition from lower cost generic products.

In general, the Company faces increasing competition from lower-cost generic
products. The patent rights that protect its products are of varying strengths
and durations. In addition, in some countries, patent protection is
significantly weaker than in the U.S. or in the EU. In the U.S. and the EU,
political pressure to reduce spending on prescription drugs has led to
legislation and other measures that encourage the use of generic and
biosimilar products. Although it is the Company's policy to actively protect
its patent rights, generic challenges to the Company's products can arise at
any time, and the Company's patents may not prevent the emergence of generic
competition for its products.

Loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by
generic substitutes, reducing the Company's sales of that product.
Availability of generic substitutes for the Company's drugs may adversely
affect its results of operations and cash flow. In addition, proposals emerge
from time to time in the U.S. and other countries for legislation to further
encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs. Any such proposal
that is enacted into law could worsen this substantial negative effect on the
Company's sales, business, cash flow, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects.

The Company faces intense competition from competitors' products.

The Company's products face intense competition from competitors' products.
This competition may increase as new products enter the market. In such an
event, the competitors' products may be safer or more effective, more
convenient to use, have better insurance coverage or reimbursement levels or
be more effectively marketed and sold than the Company's products.
Alternatively, in the case of generic competition, including the generic
availability of competitors' branded products, they may be equally safe and
effective products that are sold at a substantially lower price than the
Company's products. As a result, if the Company fails to maintain its
competitive position, this could have a material adverse effect on its
business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
In addition, if products that were measured at fair value and capitalized in
connection with acquisitions experience difficulties in the market that
negatively impact product cash flows, the Company may recognize material non-
cash impairment charges with respect to the value of those products.

COVID-19-related disruptions have had an adverse impact on the Company's
business, operations and financial performance. The Company is unable to
predict the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemic,
epidemic or similar public health threat will adversely impact its business,
operations, financial performance, results of operations, and financial
condition.

The Company's business and financial results have been negatively impacted by
COVID-19-related disruptions since the start of the pandemic. Merck believes
that global health systems and patients have largely adapted to the impacts of
COVID-19, however, a substantial portion of Merck's Pharmaceutical segment
revenue is comprised of physician-administered products which could be
adversely affected by the pandemic if it continues. The continued duration and
severity of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain and difficult to predict. The
degree to which COVID-19-related disruptions impact the Company's results in
2023 will depend on future developments, beyond the Company's knowledge or
control, including governmental and third-party actions taken to contain or
prevent the spread and treatment of the virus and mitigate its public health
and economic effects. In addition, any future pandemic, epidemic or similar
public health threat could present similar risks to the Company's business,
cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

The Company has significant global operations, which expose it to additional
risks, and any adverse event could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's results of operations and financial condition.

The extent of the Company's operations outside the U.S. is significant. Risks
inherent in conducting a global business include:

•changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs and pricing
restrictions in key markets;

•multiple regulatory requirements that could restrict the Company's ability to
manufacture and sell its products in key markets;

•trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements,
including the imposition of trade sanctions or similar restrictions by the
U.S. or other governments;

•foreign exchange fluctuations;

•diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries; and

•possible nationalization and expropriation.

In addition, there may be changes to the Company's business and political
position if there is instability, disruption or destruction in a significant
geographic region, regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil
insurrection or social unrest; and natural or man-made disasters, including
famine, flood, fire, earthquake, storm or disease. Events like these could
result in material adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, currency
exchange rates and financial markets.

Climate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate
change may negatively affect the Company's business, results of operations,
cash flows and prospects.

The Company believes that climate change has the potential to negatively
affect its business and results of operations, cash flows and prospects. The
Company is exposed to physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions or
rising sea levels), risks in transitioning to a low-carbon economy (such as
additional legal or regulatory requirements, changes in technology, market
risk and reputational risk) and social and human effects (such as population
dislocations and harm to health and well-being) associated with climate
change. These risks can be either acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term).

The adverse impacts of climate change include increased frequency and severity
of natural disasters and extreme weather events such as hurricanes, tornados,
wildfires (exacerbated by drought), flooding, and extreme heat. Extreme
weather and sea-level rise pose physical risks to the Company's facilities as
well as those of its suppliers. Such risks include losses incurred as a result
of physical damage to facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business
interruption caused by such natural disasters and extreme weather events.
Other potential physical impacts due to climate change include reduced access
to high-quality water in certain regions and the loss of biodiversity, which
could impact future product development. These risks could disrupt the
Company's operations and its supply chain, which may result in increased
costs.

New legal or regulatory requirements may be enacted to prevent, mitigate, or
adapt to the implications of a changing climate and its effects on the
environment. These regulations, which may differ across jurisdictions, could
result in the Company being subject to new or expanded carbon pricing or
taxes, increased compliance costs,

30

Table of Contents

restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions, investment in new technologies,
increased carbon disclosure and transparency, investments in data gathering
and reporting systems, upgrades of facilities to meet new building codes, and
the redesign of utility systems, which could increase the Company's operating
costs, including the cost of electricity and energy used by the Company. The
Company's supply chain would likely be subject to these same transitional
risks and would likely pass along any increased costs to the Company, all of
which may affect the Company's ability to procure raw materials or other
supplies required for the operation of the Company's business at the
quantities and levels we require.

Environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters may impact the Company's
business and reputation.

Governmental authorities, non-governmental organizations, customers,
investors, external stakeholders and employees are increasingly sensitive to
ESG concerns, such as diversity and inclusion, climate change, water use,
recyclability or recoverability of packaging, and plastic waste. This focus on
ESG concerns may lead to new requirements that could result in increased costs
associated with developing, manufacturing and distributing the Company's
products. The Company's ability to compete could also be affected by changing
customer preferences and requirements, such as growing demand for more
environmentally friendly products, packaging or supplier practices, or by
failure to meet such customer expectations or demand. While the Company
strives to improve its ESG performance and has set certain ESG goals and
initiatives, the Company risks negative stockholder reaction, including from
proxy advisory services, as well as damage to its brand and reputation, if the
Company fails to meet its goals and initiatives or otherwise does not act
responsibly, or if the Company is perceived to not be acting responsibly, in
key ESG areas, including equitable access to medicines and vaccines, product
quality and safety, diversity and inclusion, environmental stewardship,
support for local communities, corporate governance and transparency, and
addressing human capital factors in the Company's operations. Responding to
these ESG considerations and implementation of the Company's ESG goals and
initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and
depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside of the
Company's control. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the
Company's ESG goals and initiatives. If the Company does not meet the evolving
and varied ESG expectations of its investors, customers and other
stakeholders, the Company could experience reduced demand for its products,
loss of customers, and other negative impacts on the Company's business and
results of operations.

Failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel could affect the
Company's ability to successfully develop and commercialize products.

The Company's success is largely dependent on its continued ability to attract
and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as
well as personnel with expertise in clinical research and development,
governmental regulation and commercialization. Competition for qualified
personnel in the pharmaceutical industry, both in the U.S. and
internationally, is intense. The Company cannot be sure that it will be able
to attract and retain quality personnel or that the costs of doing so will not
materially increase.

The Company may experience difficulties and delays in manufacturing certain of
its products, including vaccines.

Merck has, in the past, experienced difficulties in manufacturing certain of
its products, including vaccines. For example, in 2020 the Company issued a
product recall for Zerbaxa following the identification of product sterility
issues. The Company may, in the future, experience other difficulties and
delays in manufacturing its products, such as (i) failure of the Company or
any of its vendors or suppliers to comply with Current Good Manufacturing
Practices and other applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines
that could lead to manufacturing shutdowns, product shortages and delays in
product manufacturing; (ii) delays related to the construction of new
facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended
to support future demand for the Company's products; and (iii) other
manufacturing or distribution problems including supply chain delays,
shortages in raw materials, changes in manufacturing production sites and
limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in
types of products produced, or physical limitations that could impact
continuous supply. As previously disclosed, the Company is working to reduce
the level of nitrosamines in its sitagliptin-containing medicines such as
Januvia. Difficulties in reducing those levels, or achieving timely regulatory
approvals for required changes, could result in product shortages. In
addition, the Company could experience difficulties or delays in manufacturing
its products caused by natural disasters, such as hurricanes. Manufacturing
difficulties can result in product shortages, leading to lost sales and
reputational harm to the Company.

The Company may not be able to realize the expected benefits of its
investments in emerging markets.

The Company has been taking steps to increase its sales in emerging markets.
However, there is no guarantee that the Company's efforts to expand sales in
these markets will succeed. Some countries within emerging markets may be
especially vulnerable to periods of global financial instability or may have
very limited resources to spend on health care. In order for the Company to
successfully implement its emerging markets strategy, it must attract and
retain qualified personnel. The Company may also be required to increase its
reliance on third-party agents within less developed markets, which may affect
its ability to realize continued growth and may also increase the Company's
risk exposure. In addition, many of these countries have currencies that
fluctuate substantially and, if such currencies devalue and the Company cannot
offset the devaluations, the Company's financial performance within such
countries could be adversely affected.

The Company's business in China has grown rapidly in the past few years, and
the importance of China to the Company's overall pharmaceutical and vaccines
business outside the U.S. has increased accordingly. In addition to its
commercial operations, the Company has significant research and manufacturing
operations in China. If geopolitical tensions were to increase and disrupt the
Company's operations in China, such disruption could result in a material
adverse effect on the Company's product development, sales, business, cash
flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

Also, continued growth of the Company's business in China is dependent upon
ongoing development of a favorable environment for innovative pharmaceutical
products and vaccines, sustained access for the Company's currently marketed
products, and the absence of trade impediments or adverse pricing controls. As
noted above in "Competition and the Health Care Environment," pricing pressure
in China has increased as the Chinese government has been taking steps to
reduce costs, including implementing health care reform that has led to the
acceleration of generic substitution, where available. While the mechanism for
drugs being added to the NRDL evolves, inclusion may require a price
negotiation which could impact the outlook in the market for selected brands.
In 2021, drugs were added to the NRDL with an average of more than 60% price
reductions. A new NRDL was recently completed in which new entries averaged
60% price reductions. While pricing pressure has always existed in China,
health care reform has increased this pressure in part due to the acceleration
of generic substitution through the government's VBP program. In 2019, the
government implemented the VBP program through a tendering process for mature
products which have generic substitutes with a Generic Quality Consistency
Evaluation approval. Mature products that have entered into the last five
rounds of VBP had, on average, a price reduction of more than 50%. The Company
expects VBP to be a semi-annual process that will have a significant impact on
mature products moving forward.

For all these reasons, sales within emerging markets carry significant risks.
However, at the same time, macro economic growth of selected emerging markets
is expected to outpace Europe and even the U.S., leading to significant
increased health care spending in those countries and access to innovative
medicines for patients. A failure to maintain the Company's presence in
emerging markets could therefore have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and
prospects.

The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and related global disruptions
could adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and
financial condition.

The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, and the financial and economic
sanctions imposed by the U.S., the EU and other countries in response, are
having pervasive direct and indirect effects on the global economy, and may
adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial
condition. The Company is working cross-functionally across the globe to
monitor and mitigate interruptions to business continuity resulting from the
war, including its impact on Merck's supply chain, operations and clinical
trials.

For humanitarian reasons, the Company is continuing to supply essential
medicines and vaccines in Russia while working to maintain compliance with
international sanctions. Merck is donating profits resulting from its
operations in Russia to humanitarian causes. The Company does not have
research or manufacturing facilities in Russia, currently does not plan to
make further investments in Russia, and has suspended screening and enrollment
in ongoing clinical trials as well as planning for new studies in Russia,
although the Company continues to treat patients already enrolled in existing
clinical trials and collect data from these studies.

The financial impacts of the war between Russia and Ukraine were immaterial to
the Company's consolidated financial statements in 2022. However, the degree
to which the war and related disruptions will impact the Company's results in
the future is difficult to predict and will depend on developments outside of
the Company's control, including, but not limited to, the duration and
severity of the war, ongoing and additional financial and economic sanctions
imposed by governments in response, restrictions on travel, regional
instability, geopolitical

shifts, and adverse effects on fuel and energy costs, supply chains,
macroeconomic conditions, currency exchange rates and financial markets. Such
developments may negatively impact the Company directly or indirectly as well
as the parties with which the Company conducts business. In addition, the
effects of the war between Russia and Ukraine could heighten other risks
disclosed herein, which could materially adversely affect the Company's
business, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in currency exchange
rates and interest rates.

The Company operates in multiple jurisdictions and virtually all sales are
denominated in currencies of the local jurisdiction. Additionally, the Company
has entered and will enter into business development transactions, borrowings
or other financial transactions that may give rise to currency and interest
rate exposure.

Since the Company cannot, with certainty, foresee and mitigate against such
adverse fluctuations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates
and inflation could negatively affect the Company's business, cash flow,
results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

In order to mitigate against the adverse impact of these market fluctuations,
the Company will from time to time enter into hedging agreements. While
hedging agreements, such as currency options and forwards and interest rate
swaps, may limit some of the exposure to exchange rate and interest rate
fluctuations, such attempts to mitigate these risks may be costly and not
always successful.

A portion of Merck's indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates,
primarily based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). LIBOR is the
subject of national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals
for reform, which will cause LIBOR to cease to exist entirely in the future.
While the Company has begun to implement alternative reference rates as
alternatives to LIBOR, the Company cannot predict the consequences and timing
of any additional or unexpected developments, which could include an increase
in interest expense.

Pharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns.

Unexpected safety or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to marketed
products, whether or not scientifically justified, leading to product recalls,
withdrawals, or declining sales, as well as product liability, consumer fraud
and/or other claims, including potential civil or criminal governmental
actions.

Reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could
materially adversely affect the Company's business.

The Company depends on third parties, including suppliers, alliances with
other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and third-party service
providers, for key aspects of its business including development, manufacture
and commercialization of its products and support for its information
technology (IT) systems. Failure of these third parties to meet their
contractual, regulatory and other obligations to the Company or the
development of factors that materially disrupt the relationships between the
Company and these third parties could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business.

Negative events in the animal health industry could have a material adverse
effect on future results of operations and financial condition.

Future sales of key animal health products could be adversely affected by a
number of risk factors including certain risks that are specific to the animal
health business. For example, the outbreak of disease carried by animals, such
as African Swine Fever, could lead to their widespread death and precautionary
destruction as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animals, which
could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. Also, the outbreak
of any highly contagious diseases near the Company's main production sites
could require the Company to immediately halt the manufacture of its animal
health products at such sites or force the Company to incur substantial
expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere. Other risks
specific to animal health include epidemics and pandemics, government
procurement and pricing practices, weather and global agribusiness economic
events. In addition, in 2022, sales of Bravecto were $1.0 billion, which
represented approximately 19% of the Company's Animal Health segment sales.
Any negative event with respect to Bravecto could have a material adverse
effect on the Company's Animal Health sales. If the Animal Health segment of
the Company's business becomes more significant, the impact of any such events
on future results of operations could also become more significant.

Biologics and vaccines carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have
a material adverse effect on the Company's future results of operations and
financial condition.

The successful development, testing, manufacturing and commercialization of
biologics and vaccines, particularly human and animal health vaccines, is a
long, complex, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and
uncertainties related to biologics and vaccines, including:

•There may be limited access to, and supply of, normal and diseased tissue
samples, cell lines, pathogens, bacteria, viral strains and other biological
materials. In addition, government regulations in multiple jurisdictions, such
as the U.S. and the EU, could result in restricted access to, or transport or
use of, such materials. If the Company loses access to sufficient sources of
such materials, or if tighter restrictions are imposed on the use of such
materials, the Company may not be able to conduct research activities as
planned and may incur additional development costs.

•The development, manufacturing and marketing of biologics and vaccines are
subject to regulation by the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory bodies. These
regulations are often more complex and extensive than the regulations
applicable to other pharmaceutical products. For example, in the U.S., a BLA,
including both preclinical and clinical trial data and extensive data
regarding the manufacturing procedures, is required for human vaccine
candidates, and FDA approval is generally required for the release of each
manufactured commercial human vaccine lot.

•Manufacturing biologics and vaccines, especially in large quantities, is
often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies to handle
living micro-organisms. Each lot of an approved biologic and vaccine must
undergo thorough testing for identity, strength, quality, purity and potency.
Manufacturing biologics requires facilities specifically designed for and
validated for this purpose, and sophisticated quality assurance and quality
control procedures are necessary. Slight deviations anywhere in the
manufacturing process, including filling, labeling, packaging, storage and
shipping and quality control and testing, may result in lot failures, product
recalls or spoilage. When changes are made to the manufacturing process, the
Company may be required to provide preclinical and clinical data showing the
comparable identity, strength, quality, purity or potency of the products
before and after such changes.

•Biologics and vaccines are frequently costly to manufacture because
production ingredients are derived from living animal or plant material, and
most biologics and vaccines cannot be made synthetically. In particular,
keeping up with the demand for vaccines may be difficult due to the complexity
of producing vaccines.

•The use of biologically derived ingredients can lead to variability in the
manufacturing process and could lead to allegations of harm, including
infections or allergic reactions, which allegations would be reviewed through
a standard investigation process that could lead to closure of product
facilities due to possible contamination. Any of these events could result in
substantial costs.

Risks Relating to Government Regulation and Legal Proceedings

The health care industry in the U.S. has been, and will continue to be,
subject to increasing regulation and political action.

As discussed above in "Competition and the Health Care Environment," the
Company believes that the health care industry will continue to be subject to
increasing regulation as well as political and legal action, as future
proposals to reform the health care system are considered by the Executive
branch, Congress and state legislatures.

In 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which makes significant
changes to how drugs are covered and paid for under the Medicare program,
including the creation of financial penalties for drugs whose prices rise
faster than the rate of inflation, redesign of the Medicare Part D program to
require manufacturers to bear more of the liability for certain drug benefits,
and government price-setting for certain Medicare Part D drugs, starting in
2026, and Medicare Part B drugs starting in 2028.

In addition, in 2021, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act, which
included a provision that eliminates the statutory cap on rebates drug
manufacturers pay to Medicaid beginning in January 2024. These rebates act as
a discount off the list price and eliminating the cap means that manufacturer
discounts paid to Medicaid can increase. Prior to this change, manufacturers
have not been required to pay more than 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price
(AMP) in rebates to state Medicaid programs for Medicaid-covered drugs. As a
result of this provision, beginning in 2024, it is possible that manufacturers
may have to pay state Medicaid programs more in rebates than they received on
sales of particular products. This change could present a risk to Merck in the
future for drugs that have high Medicaid utilization and rebate exposure that
is more than 100% of the AMP.

In the U.S., the Biden Administration and Congress continue to discuss
legislation designed to control health care costs, including the cost of
drugs. The Company cannot predict what additional future changes in the health
care industry in general, or the pharmaceutical industry in particular, will
occur; however, any changes could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and
prospects.

The Company's products, including products in development, cannot be marketed
unless the Company obtains and maintains regulatory approval.

The Company's activities, including research, preclinical testing, clinical
trials and the manufacturing and marketing of its products, are subject to
extensive regulation by numerous federal, state and local governmental
authorities in the U.S., including the FDA, and by foreign regulatory
authorities, including in the EU, Japan and China. In the U.S., the FDA
administers requirements covering the testing, approval, safety,
effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling and marketing of prescription
pharmaceuticals and vaccines. In some cases, the FDA requirements have
increased the amount of time and resources necessary to develop new products
and bring them to market in the U.S. Regulation outside the U.S. also is
primarily focused on drug safety and effectiveness and, in many cases,
reduction in the cost of drugs. The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities,
including in the EU, Japan and China, have substantial discretion to require
additional testing, to delay or withhold registration and marketing approval
and to otherwise preclude distribution and sale of a product.

Even if the Company is successful in developing new products, it will not be
able to market any of those products unless and until it has obtained all
required regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where it proposes to market
the new products. Once obtained, the Company must maintain approval as long as
it plans to market its new products in each jurisdiction where approval is
required. The Company's failure to obtain approval, significant delays in the
approval process, or its failure to maintain approval in any jurisdiction will
prevent it from selling the products in that jurisdiction. The Company would
not be able to realize revenues for those new products in any jurisdiction
where it does not have approval.

Developments following regulatory approval may adversely affect sales of the
Company's products.

Even after a product reaches the market, certain developments following
regulatory approval may decrease demand for the Company's products, including
the following:

•results in post-approval Phase 4 trials or other studies;

•the re-review of products that are already marketed;

•the recall or loss of marketing approval of products that are already
marketed;

•changing government standards or public expectations regarding safety,
efficacy, quality or labeling changes;

•scrutiny of advertising and promotion; and

•the withdrawal of indications granted pursuant to accelerated approvals.

In the past, clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance of certain
marketed drugs of the Company and of competitors within the industry have
raised concerns that have led to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling of
marketed products. Clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance of certain
marketed drugs also have raised concerns among some prescribers and patients
relating to the safety or efficacy of pharmaceutical products in general that
have negatively affected the sales of such products. In addition, increased
scrutiny of the outcomes of clinical trials has led to increased volatility in
market reaction. Further, these matters often attract litigation and, even
where the basis for the litigation is groundless, considerable resources may
be needed to respond.

In addition, following in the wake of product withdrawals and other
significant safety issues, health authorities such as the FDA, the EMA,
Japan's PMDA and China's NMPA have increased their focus on safety when
assessing the benefit/risk balance of drugs. Some health authorities appear to
have become more cautious when making decisions about approvability of new
products or indications.

If previously unknown side effects are discovered or if there is an increase
in negative publicity regarding known side effects of any of the Company's
products, it could significantly reduce demand for the product or require the
Company to take actions that could negatively affect sales, including removing
the product from the market, restricting its distribution or applying for
labeling changes. Further, in the current environment in which all
pharmaceutical companies operate, the Company is at risk for product liability
and consumer protection claims and

35

* * *

Table of Contents

civil and criminal governmental actions related to its products, research
and/or marketing activities. In addition, dissemination of promotional
materials through evolving digital channels serves to increase visibility and
scrutiny in the marketplace.

The Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and
regulations.

The Company is currently subject to a number of government laws and
regulations and, in the future, could become subject to new government laws
and regulations. The costs of compliance with such laws and regulations, or
the negative results of non-compliance, could adversely affect the business,
cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects of the
Company; these laws and regulations include (i) additional health care reform
initiatives in the U.S. or in other countries, including additional mandatory
discounts or fees; (ii) the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or other
anti-bribery and corruption laws; (iii) new laws, regulations and judicial or
other governmental decisions affecting pricing, drug reimbursement, and access
or marketing within or across jurisdictions; (iv) changes in intellectual
property laws; (v) changes in accounting standards; (vi) new and increasing
data privacy regulations and enforcement, particularly in the EU, the U.S.,
and China; (vii) legislative mandates or preferences for local manufacturing
of pharmaceutical or vaccine products; (viii) emerging and new global
regulatory requirements for reporting payments and other value transfers to
health care professionals; (ix) environmental regulations; and (x) the
potential impact of importation restrictions, embargoes, trade sanctions and
legislative and/or other regulatory changes.

The Company is subject to evolving and complex tax laws, which may result in
additional liabilities that may affect results of operations and financial
condition.

The Company is subject to evolving and complex tax laws in the jurisdictions
in which it operates. Significant judgment is required for determining the
Company's tax liabilities, and the Company's tax returns are routinely
examined by various tax authorities. In connection with the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting
project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax
authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit
scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. The Company believes that its
accrual for tax contingencies is adequate for all open years based on past
experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions
by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of tax contingencies, the
ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments greater or less
than amounts accrued. In addition, the Company may be negatively affected by
changes in tax laws, or new tax laws, affecting, for example, tax rates,
and/or revised tax law interpretations in domestic or foreign jurisdictions,
including, among others, any potential changes to the existing U.S. tax law by
the current U.S. Presidential administration and Congress, as well as any
changes in tax law resulting from the implementation of the OECD's two-pillar
solution to reform the international tax landscape.

The Company has taken the position, based on the opinions of tax counsel, that
its distribution of Organon common stock in connection with the 2021 Spin-Off
qualifies as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. If any facts, assumptions, representations, and undertakings from
the Company and Organon regarding the past and future conduct of their
respective businesses and other matters are incorrect or not otherwise
satisfied, the Spin-Off may not qualify for tax-free treatment, which could
result in significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities for the Company and
its shareholders.

Adverse outcomes in current or future legal matters could negatively affect
Merck's business.

Current or future litigation, claims, proceedings and government
investigations could preclude or delay the commercialization of Merck's
products or could adversely affect Merck's business, results of operations,
cash flow, prospects and financial condition. Such legal matters may include,
but are not limited to: (i) intellectual property disputes; (ii) adverse
decisions in litigation, including product safety and liability, consumer
protection and commercial cases; (iii) anti-bribery regulations, such as the
FCPA, including compliance with ongoing reporting obligations to the
government resulting from any settlements; (iv) recalls or withdrawals of
pharmaceutical products or forced closings of manufacturing plants; (v)
product pricing and promotional matters; (vi) lawsuits, claims and
administrative proceedings asserting, or investigations into, violations of
securities, antitrust, Federal and state pricing, consumer protection, data
privacy and other laws and regulations; (vii) environmental, health, safety
and sustainability matters, including regulatory actions in response to
climate change; and (viii) tax liabilities resulting from assessments from tax
authorities.

As previously disclosed, Merck, along with certain subsidiaries, are
defendants in a number of lawsuits filed starting in 2018 on behalf of direct
and indirect purchasers of Zetia (ezetimibe) alleging violations of federal
and state antitrust laws, as well as other state statutory and common law
causes of action. The lawsuits filed on behalf of

36

* * *

Table of Contents

twenty-five direct purchasers, eight retailers, and a class of indirect
purchasers are scheduled to proceed to trial on April 17, 2023. In these
cases, plaintiffs seek up to a maximum of $12.7 billion in damages after
trebling.

See Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," Note 11,
"Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities" for more information on the
Company's legal matters.

Product liability insurance for products may be limited, cost prohibitive or
unavailable.

As a result of a number of factors, product liability insurance has become
less available while the cost of such insurance has increased significantly.
The Company is subject to a substantial number of product liability claims.
See Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," Note 11\.
"Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities" below for more information on
the Company's current product liability litigation. With respect to product
liability, the Company self-insures substantially all of its risk, as the
availability of commercial insurance has become more restrictive. The Company
has evaluated its risks and has determined that the cost of obtaining product
liability insurance outweighs the likely benefits of the coverage that is
available and, as such, has no insurance for most product liabilities. The
Company will continually assess the most efficient means to address its risk;
however, there can be no guarantee that insurance coverage will be obtained
or, if obtained, will be sufficient to fully cover product liabilities that
may arise.

Risks Related to Technology

The Company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated software applications
and computing infrastructure. The Company could be a target of future cyber-
attacks that could lead to a disruption of its worldwide operations, including
manufacturing, research and sales operations.

The Company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated software applications,
complex information technology systems, computing infrastructure, and cloud
service providers (collectively, IT systems) to conduct critical operations.
Certain of these systems are managed, hosted, provided or used by third
parties to assist in conducting the Company's business. Disruption,
degradation, or manipulation of these IT systems through intentional or
accidental means by the Company's employees, third parties with authorized
access or unauthorized third parties could adversely affect key business
processes. Cyber-attacks against the Company's IT systems or third-party
providers' IT systems, such as cloud-based systems, could result in exposure
of confidential information, the modification of critical data, and/or the
failure of critical operations. Misuse of any of these IT systems could result
in the disclosure of sensitive personal information or the theft of trade
secrets, intellectual property, or other confidential business information.
The Company continues to leverage new and innovative technologies across the
enterprise to replace outmoded technology and improve the efficacy and
efficiency of its business processes, including data acquisition; the use of
which can create new risks.

Although the aggregate impact of cyber-attacks and network disruptions on the
Company's operations and financial condition has not been material to date,
the Company continues to be a target of events of this nature and expects them
to continue. The Company monitors its data, information technology and
personnel usage of Company IT systems to reduce these risks and continues to
do so on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats. There can be
no assurance that the Company's efforts to protect its data and IT systems or
the efforts of third-party providers to protect their IT systems will be
successful in preventing disruptions to the Company's operations, including
its manufacturing, research and sales operations. Such disruptions have in the
past and could in the future result in loss of revenue, or the loss of
critical or sensitive information from the Company's or the Company's third-
party providers' databases or IT systems and have in the past and could in the
future also result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to the
Company and substantial remediation costs.

Social media and mobile messaging platforms present risks and challenges.

The inappropriate and/or unauthorized use of certain social media and mobile
messaging channels could cause brand damage or information leakage or could
lead to legal implications, including from the improper collection and/or
dissemination of personally identifiable information. In addition, negative or
inaccurate posts or comments about the Company or its products on any social
networking platforms could damage the Company's reputation, brand image and
goodwill. Further, the disclosure of non-public Company-sensitive information
by the Company's workforce or others through external media channels could
lead to information loss. Although there are internal Company Social Media and
Mobile Messaging Policies that guide employees on appropriate personal and
professional use of these platforms for communication about the Company, the
processes in place may not completely secure and protect information.
Identifying new points of entry as new communication tools expand also
presents new challenges.

Cautionary Factors that May Affect Future Results

(Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995)

This report and other written reports and oral statements made from time to
time by the Company may contain so-called "forward-looking statements," all of
which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks
and uncertainties which may cause results to differ materially from those set
forth in the statements. One can identify these forward-looking statements by
their use of words such as "anticipates," "expects," "plans," "will,"
"estimates," "forecasts," "projects" and other words of similar meaning, or
negative variations of any of the foregoing. One can also identify them by the
fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These
statements are likely to address the Company's growth strategy, financial
results, product approvals, product potential, development programs,
environmental or other sustainability initiatives, and may include statements
related to the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. One must carefully
consider any such statement and should understand that many factors could
cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's forward-looking
statements. These factors include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety
of other risks and uncertainties, including some that are known and some that
are not. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual future
results may vary materially. The Company does not assume the obligation to
update any forward-looking statement. The Company cautions you not to place
undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Although it is not
possible to predict or identify all such factors, they may include the
following:

•Competition from generic and/or biosimilar products as the Company's products
lose patent protection.

•Increased "brand" competition in therapeutic areas important to the Company's
long-term business performance.

•The difficulties and uncertainties inherent in new product development. The
outcome of the lengthy and complex process of new product development is
inherently uncertain. A drug candidate can fail at any stage of the process
and one or more late-stage product candidates could fail to receive regulatory
approval. New product candidates may appear promising in development but fail
to reach the market because of efficacy or safety concerns, the inability to
obtain necessary regulatory approvals, the difficulty or excessive cost to
manufacture and/or the infringement of patents or intellectual property rights
of others. Furthermore, the sales of new products may prove to be
disappointing and fail to reach anticipated levels.

•Pricing pressures, both in the U.S. and abroad, including rules and practices
of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and
regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and health care reform,
pharmaceutical reimbursement and pricing in general.

•The impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic and any future pandemic, epidemic,
or similar public health threat, on the Company's business, operations,
financial performance and prospects.

•Changes in government laws and regulations, including laws governing
intellectual property, and the enforcement thereof affecting the Company's
business.

•Efficacy or safety concerns with respect to marketed products, whether or not
scientifically justified, leading to product recalls, withdrawals or declining
sales.

•Significant changes in customer relationships or changes in the behavior and
spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services,
including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications,
reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance
coverage.

•Legal factors, including product liability claims, antitrust litigation and
governmental investigations, including tax disputes, environmental concerns
and patent disputes with branded and generic competitors, any of which could
preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect the profitability
of existing products.

•Cyber-attacks on the Company's or third-party providers' information
technology systems, which could disrupt the Company's operations.

•Lost market opportunity resulting from delays and uncertainties in the
approval process of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities.

•Increased focus on privacy issues in countries around the world, including
the U.S., the EU, and China. The legislative and regulatory landscape for
privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an
increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the
potential to affect directly the Company's business, including laws in a
majority of states in the U.S. requiring security breach notification.

•Changes in tax laws including changes related to the taxation of foreign
earnings.

•Changes in accounting pronouncements promulgated by standard-setting or
regulatory bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the
SEC, that are adverse to the Company.

•Economic factors over which the Company has no control, including changes in
inflation, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

This list should not be considered an exhaustive statement of all potential
risks and uncertainties. See "Risk Factors" above.

Description of Merck's Business

Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck or the Company) is a global health care company that
delivers innovative health solutions through its prescription medicines,
including biologic therapies, vaccines and animal health products. The
Company's operations are principally managed on a product basis and include
two operating segments, Pharmaceutical and Animal Health, both of which are
reportable segments.

The Pharmaceutical segment includes human health pharmaceutical and vaccine
products. Human health pharmaceutical products consist of therapeutic and
preventive agents, generally sold by prescription, for the treatment of human
disorders. The Company sells these human health pharmaceutical products
primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies
and managed health care providers such as health maintenance organizations,
pharmacy benefit managers and other institutions. Human health vaccine
products consist of preventive pediatric, adolescent and adult vaccines. The
Company sells these human health vaccines primarily to physicians,
wholesalers, physician distributors and government entities.

The Animal Health segment discovers, develops, manufactures and markets a wide
range of veterinary pharmaceutical and vaccine products, as well as health
management solutions and services, for the prevention, treatment and control
of disease in all major livestock and companion animal species. The Company
also offers an extensive suite of digitally connected identification,
traceability and monitoring products. The Company sells its products to
veterinarians, distributors, animal producers, farmers and pet owners.

Spin-Off of Organon & Co.

On June 2, 2021, Merck completed the spin-off of products from its women's
health, biosimilars and established brands businesses into a new, independent,
publicly traded company named Organon & Co. (Organon) through a distribution
of Organon's publicly traded stock to Company shareholders. The distribution
is expected to qualify and has been treated as tax-free to the Company and its
shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The established brands
included in the transaction consisted of dermatology, non-opioid pain
management, respiratory, select cardiovascular products, as well as the rest
of Merck's diversified brands franchise. Merck's existing research pipeline
programs continue to be owned and developed within Merck as planned. The
historical results of the businesses that were contributed to Organon in the
spin-off have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Company's
consolidated financial statements through the date of the spin-off (see Note 3
to the consolidated financial statements).

Executive Summary

Merck's 2022 results reflect sustained strong demand for the Company's
innovative product portfolio benefiting patients globally, enabled by strong
operational and commercial execution, the completion of business development
transactions to support its science-led strategy, as well as progress in its
pipeline across therapeutic areas, modalities and stage of development.

![mrk-20221231_g3.jpg](mrk-20221231_g3.jpg)

Worldwide sales were $59.3 billion in 2022, an increase of 22% compared with
2021, or 26% excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. The sales
increase was primarily due to growth in virology (driven by the benefit of
Lagevrio sales), oncology, vaccines and hospital acute care. Sales within the
Animal Health business were consistent with prior year. As discussed below,
COVID-19-related disruptions negatively affected sales in 2022, but to a
lesser extent than in 2021, which benefited year-over-year sales growth.

Merck continues to execute strategic business development opportunities to
augment its robust internal pipeline with compelling external science.
Highlights of 2022 activity include the following:

•Exercised an option to jointly develop and commercialize personalized
therapeutic cancer vaccine mRNA-4157/V940 under an existing collaboration and
license agreement with Moderna, Inc. (Moderna).

•Entered into a collaboration with Orna Therapeutics (Orna), a company
pioneering a new investigational class of engineered circular RNA therapies,
to discover, develop, and commercialize multiple programs, including vaccines
and therapeutics in the areas of infectious disease and oncology.

•Entered into a global co-development and co-commercialization agreement for
Orion Corporation's (Orion) investigational candidate ODM-208 (MK-5684)
currently being evaluated for the treatment of patients with metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

•Entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Sichuan Kelun-Biotech
Biopharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Kelun-Biotech) for the development, manufacture
and commercialization of an investigational antibody drug conjugate (ADC)
(MK-1200) for the treatment of solid tumors.

•Exercised an option to obtain an exclusive license (outside of Chinese
mainland, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) for the development, manufacture and
commercialization of Kelun-Biotech's trophoblast antigen 2 (TROP2)-targeting
ADC programs, including its lead compound SKB-264 (MK-2870).

•Entered into a license and collaboration agreement expanding the Company's
relationship with Kelun-Biotech pursuant to which Merck gained exclusive
rights for the research, development, manufacture and commercialization of up
to seven investigational preclinical ADCs for the treatment of cancer (Kelun-
Biotech retained rights for certain licensed and option ADCs for Chinese
mainland, Hong Kong and Macau); the transaction closed in February 2023.

•Entered into agreement to acquire Imago BioSciences, Inc. (Imago), a clinical
stage biopharmaceutical company developing new medicines for the treatment of
myeloproliferative neoplasms and other bone marrow diseases; the acquisition
closed in January 2023.

During 2022, the Company received numerous regulatory approvals within
oncology. Keytruda received approval for additional indications in the U.S.
and/or internationally as monotherapy in the therapeutic areas of biliary,
colorectal, endometrial, gastric, melanoma, small intestine and renal cell
cancers, as well as in combination with chemotherapy in the therapeutic areas
of breast and cervical cancers. Keytruda was also approved in combination with
Lenvima in Japan for the treatment of certain adult patients with radically
unresectable or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Lenvima is being
developed in collaboration with Eisai Co., Ltd. (Eisai). Lynparza, which is
being developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca PLC (AstraZeneca), received
approval in the U.S., the European Union (EU) and Japan for the adjuvant
treatment of certain adult patients with high-risk early breast cancer and in
the EU for the treatment of certain patients with mCRPC.

Also in 2022, Vaxneuvance, a vaccine to help prevent pneumococcal disease, was
approved for expanded indications in the U.S. and the EU to include use in
infants, adolescents and children. Additionally in 2022, Lyfnua (gefapixant)
was approved in Japan for adults with refractory or unexplained chronic cough.
In addition, in 2022, Lagevrio, which is being developed in a collaboration
with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP (Ridgeback), received emergency conditional
approval in China for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults who
are at risk for progressing to severe COVID-19.

In addition to the recent regulatory approvals discussed above, the Company
advanced its late-stage pipeline with several regulatory submissions.

Keytruda is under review in the U.S. and/or internationally for supplemental
indications for the treatment of certain patients with hepatocellular, Merkel
cell, non-small-cell lung and urothelial cancers, as well as primary
mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). Lynparza is under review for supplemental
indications in the U.S. and Japan for the treatment of certain patients with
mCRPC. MK-4482, Lagevrio, an investigational oral antiviral COVID-19 medicine,
is under a rolling review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA); the
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the EMA has recommended the
refusal of the marketing authorization, which Merck and Ridgeback intend to
appeal. MK-7264, gefapixant, a selective, non-narcotic, orally-administered,
investigational P2X3-receptor antagonist being developed for the treatment of
refractory, chronic cough is under review in the U.S. and the EU.

The Company's Phase 3 oncology programs include:

•Keytruda in the therapeutic areas of biliary, cutaneous squamous cell,
gastric, hepatocellular, mesothelioma, ovarian, prostate and small-cell lung
cancers;

•Lynparza in combination with Keytruda for non-small-cell lung and small-cell
lung cancers;

•Lenvima in combination with Keytruda for colorectal, esophageal, gastric,
head and neck, melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancers;

•MK-1308A, the coformulation of quavonlimab, Merck's novel investigational
anti-CTLA-4 antibody, and pembrolizumab for RCC;

•MK-3475, subcutaneous pembrolizumab for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC);

•MK-3475A, the subcutaneous coformulation of pembrolizumab with hyaluronidase,
for NSCLC;

•MK-4280A, the coformulation of favezelimab, Merck's novel investigational
anti-LAG3 therapy, and pembrolizumab for colorectal cancer and hematological
malignancies;

•Welireg for RCC;

•MK-7119, Tukysa (tucatinib), which is being developed in collaboration with
Seagen Inc. (Seagen), for breast and colorectal cancers; and

•MK-7684A, the coformulation of vibostolimab, an anti-TIGIT therapy, and
pembrolizumab for melanoma, non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancers.

Additionally, the Company currently has candidates in Phase 3 clinical
development in several other therapeutic areas including:

•V116, an investigational 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for the
prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia in
adults;

•MK-7962, sotatercept, for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension
(PAH);

•MK-1654, clesrovimab, for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus;

•MK-8591A, islatravir in combination with doravirine for the treatment of
HIV-1 infection (which is on partial clinical hold for higher doses than those
used in current clinical trials); and

•MK-4482, Lagevrio, which is reflected in Phase 3 development in the U.S. as
it remains investigational following Emergency Use Authorization in 2021.

Merck's capital allocation priorities are to make investments in its business
to drive near- and long-term growth, including investing in opportunities to
address important unmet medical needs and supporting the Company's commercial
opportunities. In addition, Merck remains committed to its dividend and will
continue to pursue the most compelling external science through value-
enhancing business development transactions. Research and development expenses
in 2022 reflect higher clinical development spending particularly in the
therapeutic areas of oncology, cardiovascular, infectious diseases and
vaccines.

![mrk-20221231_g4.jpg](mrk-20221231_g4.jpg)

In November 2022, Merck's Board of Directors approved an increase to the
Company's quarterly dividend, raising it to $0.73 per share from $0.69 per
share on the Company's outstanding common stock. During 2022, the Company
returned $7.0 billion to shareholders through dividends.

![mrk-20221231_g5.jpg](mrk-20221231_g5.jpg)![mrk-20221231_g6.jpg](mrk-20221231_g6.jpg)

GAAP and Non-GAAP EPS were negatively affected in 2022, 2021 and 2020 by
$0.22, $0.65, and $1.56, respectively, of charges for certain upfront and pre-
approval milestone payments related to collaborations and licensing
agreements, as well as charges related to pre-approval assets obtained in
transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions.

War in Ukraine

In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. The Company's primary concerns are
the safety and well-being of its employees and ensuring patients and customers
have continued access to medicines and vaccines needed for patient and public
health. The Company is working cross-functionally across the globe to monitor
and mitigate interruptions to business continuity resulting from the war,
including its impact on Merck's supply chain, operations and clinical trials.
For humanitarian reasons, the Company is continuing to supply essential
medicines and vaccines in Russia while working to maintain compliance with
international sanctions. Merck is donating profits

resulting from its operations in Russia to humanitarian causes. The Company
does not have research or manufacturing facilities in Russia, currently does
not plan to make further investments in Russia, and has suspended screening
and enrollment in ongoing clinical trials as well as planning for new studies
in Russia, although the Company continues to treat patients already enrolled
in existing clinical trials and collect data from these studies. The Company
is also using its resources to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis in
Ukraine, including through donations of funds and products. The financial
impacts of the war were immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial
statements for 2022. Sales to Russia were approximately 1% of total Merck
consolidated sales for 2022 and are expected to decline in future periods. The
Company is unable to determine at this time the future direct or indirect
impacts of this war on the Company's business.

COVID-19

Although COVID-19-related disruptions had some negative effect on sales in
2022, Merck continues to believe that global health systems and patients have
largely adapted to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Merck's revenue in
2022 benefited from sales of Lagevrio, which were $5.7 billion. Merck expects
sales of Lagevrio will decline significantly in 2023 to approximately $1.0
billion.

In 2021, COVID-19-related disruptions resulted in an estimated negative impact
to Pharmaceutical segment sales of approximately $1.3 billion because a
substantial portion of Pharmaceutical segment revenue is comprised of
physician-administered products, which were unfavorably affected by social
distancing measures and fewer well visits. Sales in 2021 benefited from $952
million of Lagevrio sales.

In April 2021, Merck announced it was discontinuing the development of MK-7110
for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, which was obtained
as part of Merck's acquisition of OncoImmune (see Note 4 to the consolidated
financial statements). This decision resulted in charges of $207 million to
Cost of sales in 2021.

Operating expenses in 2021 reflect a minor positive effect as investments in
COVID-19-related research largely offset the favorable impact of lower
spending in other areas due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In March 2021, Merck announced it had entered into multiple agreements to
support efforts to expand manufacturing capacity and supply of SARS-
CoV-2/COVID-19 medicines and vaccines. The Biomedical Advanced Research and
Development Authority (BARDA), a division of the Office of the Assistant
Secretary for Preparedness and Response within the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services, provided Merck with $102 million of funding in the first
quarter of 2022 to adapt and make available a number of existing manufacturing
facilities for the production of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccines and medicines.
The funding was recognized as a reduction to Cost of sales over the expected
production period, offsetting the depreciation expense related to the amounts
that were capitalized in connection with the modification of the manufacturing
facilities. Merck and Johnson & Johnson have commenced an arbitration
regarding a dispute concerning two agreements pursuant to which Merck was
supporting the manufacturing and supply of Johnson & Johnson's SARS-
CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccine and vaccine drug product. The amounts included in the
consolidated financial statements for these agreements were immaterial in
2022. Merck does not believe the outcome of the arbitration will have a
material impact on the Company's financial statements.

Pricing

Global efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure
on product pricing and market access worldwide. Changes to the U.S. health
care system enacted in prior years as part of health care reform, as well as
increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare,
Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, have contributed to pricing
pressure. In several international markets, government-mandated pricing
actions have reduced prices of generic and patented drugs. In addition, the
Company's sales performance in 2022 was negatively affected by other cost-
reduction measures taken by governments and other third parties to lower
health care costs. In 2022, the U.S. Congress passed the Inflation Reduction
Act, which makes significant changes to how drugs are covered and paid for
under the Medicare program, including the creation of financial penalties for
drugs whose prices rise faster than the rate of inflation, redesign of the
Medicare Part D program to require manufacturers to bear more of the liability
for certain drug benefits, and government price-setting for certain Medicare
Part D drugs (starting in 2026) and Medicare Part B drugs (starting in 2028).
In the U.S., the Biden Administration and Congress continue to discuss
legislation designed to control health care costs, including the cost of
drugs. The Company anticipates all of these actions and additional actions in
the future will negatively affect sales and profits.

Supply Chain

As a result of global macroeconomic conditions, the Company is experiencing
some minor disruption and volatility in its global supply chain network. These
disruptions could increase in the future and cause delays in shipments of raw
materials and packaging, as well as related cost inflation.

Worldwide sales grew 22% in 2022 attributable in part to higher sales in the
virology franchise driven by Lagevrio. Also contributing to revenue growth
were higher sales in the oncology franchise largely due to strong growth of
Keytruda and increased alliance revenue from Lenvima and Lynparza, as well as
higher sales in the vaccines franchise, primarily attributable to growth in
Gardasil/Gardasil 9 and the launch of Vaxneuvance for pediatric use. Higher
sales of hospital acute care products, including Bridion, Zerbaxa, Dificid and
Prevymis, as well as higher revenue related to third-party manufacturing
arrangements also drove revenue growth in 2022. As discussed above,
COVID-19-related disruptions had some negative effects on sales in 2022, but
to a lesser extent than in 2021, which benefited year-over-year sales growth.
Sales growth in 2022 was partially offset by lower sales of diabetes products
Januvia and Janumet, the Pneumovax 23 vaccine, and virology products
Isentress/Isentress HD.

Sales in the U.S. grew 21% in 2022 primarily driven by higher sales of
Keytruda, Lagevrio, Gardasil 9, as well as increased alliance revenue from
Lenvima and Reblozyl (obtained as part of the Acceleron Pharma Inc.
(Acceleron) acquisition in November 2021), and the launch of Vaxneuvance for
pediatric use. Higher sales of Bridion, Welireg, Zerbaxa and Dificid, as well
as increased revenue from third-party manufacturing arrangements also
contributed to U.S. sales growth in 2022. Lower sales of Pneumovax 23 and
Januvia partially offset revenue growth in the U.S. in 2022.

International sales grew 22% in 2022 primarily due to higher sales of
Lagevrio, Gardasil/Gardasil 9, Keytruda, and Zerbaxa, as well as increased
revenue from third-party manufacturing arrangements, partially offset by lower
sales of Januvia/Janumet, Simponi, Isentress/Isentress HD, Remicade, and
Pneumovax 23\. International sales represented 54% of total sales in both 2022
and 2021.

See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for details on sales of
the Company's products. A discussion of performance for select products in the

melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or
mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) cancer (solid tumors) including MSI-H/dMMR
colorectal cancer, MSI-H/dMMR advanced endometrial carcinoma, PMBCL, tumor
mutational burden-high (TMB-H) cancer (solid tumors), and urothelial
carcinoma, including non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Additionally,
Keytruda is approved as monotherapy for the adjuvant treatment of certain
patients with RCC at intermediate-high or high risk of recurrence and for
certain patients with completely resected stage IIB, IIC or III melanoma, and
for adjuvant treatment following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for
adult patients with stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC. Keytruda

is also approved for certain patients with high-risk early-stage triple-
negative breast cancer (TNBC) in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant
treatment, and then continued as a single agent as adjuvant treatment after
surgery. In addition, Keytruda is approved for the treatment of certain
patients in combination with chemotherapy for metastatic squamous and
nonsquamous NSCLC, in combination with chemotherapy, with or without
bevacizumab for advanced cervical cancer, in combination with chemotherapy for
esophageal cancer, in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine- and
platinum-containing chemotherapy for human epidermal growth factor 2
(HER2)-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma, in combination with
chemotherapy for HNSCC, in combination with chemotherapy for locally recurrent
unresectable or metastatic TNBC, in combination with axitinib for advanced
RCC, and in combination with Lenvima for certain patients with advanced
endometrial carcinoma or advanced RCC. The Keytruda clinical development
program includes studies across a broad range of cancer types.

Global sales of Keytruda grew 22% in 2022 primarily driven by higher demand as
the Company continues to launch Keytruda with multiple new indications
globally. Sales in the U.S. continue to build across the multiple approved
metastatic indications, in particular for the treatment of certain types of
RCC, HNSCC, and MSI-H cancers. Keytruda sales growth in the U.S. also
benefited from increased uptake across recent launches in earlier-stage
indications including in high-risk early stage TNBC, as well as certain types
of RCC and melanoma. Keytruda sales growth in international markets reflects
continued uptake predominately for the NSCLC, HNSCC and RCC indications,
particularly in Europe.

The Company is a party to certain third-party license agreements pursuant to
which the Company pays royalties on sales of Keytruda. Under the terms of the
more significant of these agreements, Merck pays a royalty of 6.5% on
worldwide sales of Keytruda through December 2023 to one third party; this
royalty will decline to 2.5% for 2024 through 2026 and will terminate
thereafter. The Company pays an additional 2% royalty on worldwide sales of
Keytruda to another third party, the termination date of which varies by
country; this royalty will expire in the U.S. in September 2024 and on varying
dates in major European markets in the second half of 2025. The royalties are
included in Cost of sales.

Lynparza is an oral poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor being
developed as part of a collaboration with AstraZeneca (see Note 5 to the
consolidated financial statements). Lynparza is approved for the treatment of
certain types of advanced or recurrent ovarian, early or metastatic breast,
metastatic pancreatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers.
Alliance revenue related to Lynparza grew 13% in 2022 largely due to higher
demand globally across the multiple approved indications, particularly in the
U.S. largely attributable to uptake in the earlier-stage breast cancer
indication following approval by the FDA in March 2022.

Lynparza received several regulatory approvals in 2022 summarized below.

| | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Date| Approval  
March 2022|

prednisolone for the treatment of adult patients with mCRPC in whom
chemotherapy is not clinically indicated, based on the PROpel trial.  
  
Lenvima is an oral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor being developed as part
of a collaboration with Eisai (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial
statements). Lenvima is approved for the treatment of certain types of thyroid
cancer, RCC, HCC, in combination with everolimus for certain patients with
advanced RCC, and in combination with Keytruda for certain patients with
advanced endometrial carcinoma or advanced RCC. Alliance revenue related to
Lenvima grew 24% in 2022 reflecting uptake in the advanced RCC and advanced
endometrial carcinoma indications, particularly in the U.S.

Reblozyl is a first-in-class erythroid maturation recombinant fusion protein
obtained as part of Merck's November 2021 acquisition of Acceleron that is
being developed and commercialized through a global collaboration with Bristol
Myers Squibb (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). Reblozyl
is approved for the treatment of certain types of anemia. Merck recorded
alliance revenue of $166 million in 2022, which includes

Combined worldwide sales of Gardasil and Gardasil 9, vaccines to help prevent
certain cancers and other diseases caused by certain types of human
papillomavirus (HPV), grew 22% in 2022 driven primarily by strong demand
outside of the U.S., particularly in China, which also benefited from
increased supply. Sales of Gardasil 9 in the U.S. increased due to public
sector buying patterns and higher pricing, partially offset by lower demand.

In 2022, China's NMPA expanded the use of Gardasil 9 for use in girls and
women ages 9 to 45. The vaccine was previously approved for use in girls and
women ages 16 to 26.

The Company is a party to certain third-party license agreements pursuant to
which the Company pays royalties on sales of Gardasil/Gardasil 9\. Under the
terms of the more significant of these agreements, Merck pays a 7% royalty on
worldwide sales of Gardasil/Gardasil 9 to one third party (which expires in
December 2023) and an additional 7% royalty on sales of Gardasil/Gardasil 9 in
the U.S. to another third party (which expires in December 2028). The
royalties are included in Cost of sales.

Global sales of ProQuad, a pediatric combination vaccine to help protect
against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, grew 9% in 2022 primarily due
to higher pricing in the U.S. and higher demand in Europe.

Worldwide sales of M-M-R II, a vaccine to help protect against measles, mumps
and rubella, grew 5% in 2022 primarily due to higher pricing in the U.S.

Global sales of Varivax, a vaccine to help prevent chickenpox (varicella),
grew 2% in 2022 primarily reflecting higher pricing in the U.S., partially
offset by lower tenders in Latin America.

Worldwide sales of Pneumovax 23, a vaccine to help prevent pneumococcal
disease, declined 33% in 2022 primarily reflecting lower demand in the U.S. as
the market continues to shift toward newer adult pneumococcal conjugate
vaccines following changes in the recommendations of the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices (ACIP) in 2021. The Company expects the decline in U.S. sales of
Pneumovax 23 to continue. Lower demand in Europe also contributed to the
Pneumovax 23 sales decline in 2022.

In June 2022, the FDA approved an expanded indication for Vaxneuvance to
include use in individuals 6 weeks of age and older. The FDA's approval was
based on data from seven randomized, double-blind clinical studies assessing
safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of Vaxneuvance in infants and
children. Also in June 2022, the CDC's ACIP unanimously voted to include
Vaxneuvance as a recommended option for vaccination in infants and children,
including routine use in children under 2 years of age. These recommendations
subsequently were adopted by the director of the CDC and the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services, and published in the CDC's Morbidity and
Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). The ACIP also unanimously voted to include
Vaxneuvance in the Vaccines for Children program. In October 2022, the EC
approved an expanded indication for Vaxneuvance to include use in infants,
children and adolescents from 6 weeks to less than 18 years of age.
Vaxneuvance was previously approved for use in the U.S. and the EU in 2021 for
individuals 18 years of age and older. In September 2022, Vaxneuvance was
approved in Japan for use in adult patients. Vaxneuvance remains under review
in Japan for use in pediatric patients. Sales of Vaxneuvance were $170 million
in 2022, largely due to inventory stocking in the U.S. Merck is party to a
third-party licensing agreement pursuant to which the Company pays a royalty
of 7.25% on net sales of Vaxneuvance through 2026; this royalty will decline
to 2.5% on net sales from 2027 through 2035. The royalties are included in
Cost of sales.

Global sales of Bridion, for the reversal of two types of neuromuscular
blocking agents used during surgery, grew 10% in 2022 due to higher demand
globally, particularly in the U.S., largely attributable to Bridion's growing
share among neuromuscular blockade reversal agents and an increase in surgical
procedures. Bridion will lose market exclusivity in the EU in July 2023 and
the Company anticipates sales of Bridion in these markets will decline
thereafter.

Worldwide sales of Prevymis, a medicine for prophylaxis (prevention) of
cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease in adult CMV-seropositive
recipients of an allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, grew 16% in
2022 due to higher demand globally, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. In
February 2023, the FDA granted priority review for a supplemental New Drug
Application for Prevymis for prophylaxis of CMV disease in adult kidney
transplant recipients at high risk (D+/R-); the Prescription Drug User Fee Act
(PDUFA), or target action, date is June 5, 2023.

Worldwide sales of Dificid, for the treatment of C. difficile-associated
diarrhea, grew 50% in 2022 due to higher demand in the U.S.

In December 2020, the Company temporarily suspended sales of Zerbaxa, a
combination antibacterial and beta-lactamase inhibitor for the treatment of
certain bacterial infections, and subsequently issued a product recall,
following the identification of product sterility issues. As a result, the
Company recorded an intangible asset impairment charge in 2020 related to
Zerbaxa (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). The phased
resupply of Zerbaxa that was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2021 was
completed in 2022.

Sales of Welireg, for the treatment of certain adult patients with von Hippel-
Lindau disease-associated RCC, increased to $123 million in 2022 due to
continued uptake in the U.S. following launch in 2021.

(1) Alliance revenue represents Merck's share of profits from sales in Bayer's
marketing territories, which are product sales net of cost of sales and
commercialization costs (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).

Adempas and Verquvo are part of a worldwide collaboration with Bayer to market
and develop soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) modulators (see Note 5 to the
consolidated financial statements). Adempas is approved for the treatment of
certain types of PAH and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.
Verquvo is approved to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and heart
failure hospitalization following a hospitalization for heart failure or need
for outpatient intravenous diuretics in adults with symptomatic chronic heart
failure and reduced ejection fraction. Verquvo was approved in the U.S., the
EU and Japan in 2021 and has since been approved in several other markets.
Alliance revenue from the collaboration was essentially flat in 2022 compared
with 2021 reflecting higher profit share related to Adempas that was partially
offset by lower profit share for Verquvo reflecting higher launch costs.
Revenue also includes sales of Adempas and Verquvo in Merck's marketing
territories. Sales of Adempas in Merck's marketing territories declined 6% in
2022; excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, sales grew 7%
primarily reflecting higher demand in Japan.

Lagevrio is an investigational oral antiviral COVID-19 medicine being
developed in a collaboration with Ridgeback (see Note 5 to the consolidated
financial statements). Following initial authorizations in certain markets in
the fourth quarter of 2021, Lagevrio has since received multiple additional
authorizations worldwide. The increase in sales of Lagevrio in 2022 primarily
reflects higher sales in the UK, Japan and the U.S., as well as the launch in
Australia. In December 2022, China's NMPA granted emergency conditional
approval for Lagevrio for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults
who are at risk for progressing to severe COVID-19. Merck expects sales of
Lagevrio will decline significantly in 2023 to approximately $1.0 billion
reflecting in part the waning impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Worldwide sales of Isentress/Isentress HD, an HIV integrase inhibitor for use
in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1
infection, declined 18% in 2022 due to lower global demand, reflecting in part
competitive pressure particularly in Europe, Latin America and the U.S. The
Company expects competitive pressure for Isentress/Isentress HD to continue.
Isentress/Isentress HD will lose market exclusivity in the EU in July 2023 and
the Company anticipates sales declines of Isentress/Isentress HD in these
markets will accelerate thereafter.

(2)| %| | $| 5,276 |  
  
Worldwide combined sales of Januvia and Janumet, medicines that help lower
blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes, declined 15% in 2022
primarily reflecting the loss of exclusivity in several markets in Europe and
the Asia Pacific region, as well as lower demand in the U.S. The sales decline
was partially offset by increased demand in Latin America reflecting in part
higher government tenders.

While the key U.S. patent for Januvia and Janumet claiming the sitagliptin
compound expired in January 2023, as a result of favorable court rulings and
settlement agreements related to a later expiring patent directed to the
specific sitagliptin salt form of the products (see Note 11 to the
consolidated financial statements), the Company expects that these products
will not lose market exclusivity in the U.S. until May 2026. However, certain
of the rulings are currently being appealed, and an unfavorable court decision
would likely cause the products to lose exclusivity in the U.S. toward the end
of 2023. As a result of competitive pressures, the Company anticipates pricing
and volume declines for Januvia and Janumet in the U.S. in 2023 and
thereafter.

The Company lost market exclusivity for Januvia in all of the EU and for
Janumet in some European countries in September 2022. Merck expects that
exclusivity for Janumet will be lost in other European countries in April
2023. While the Company lost market exclusivity for Januvia in China in 2022
with the approval of a generic equivalent product, the impact on sales in 2023
is expected to be modest. It is anticipated that a generic equivalent of
Janumet will be approved in China in the first quarter of 2023, but the impact
to sales in 2023 is also expected to be modest.

Combined sales of Januvia and Janumet in Europe, China and the U.S.
represented 19%, 11% and 36%, respectively, of total combined Januvia and
Janumet sales in 2022.

In response to a request from a regulatory authority, Merck evaluated its
sitagliptin-containing products for the presence of nitrosamines. Nitrosamines
are organic compounds found at trace levels in water and food. Nitrosamines
can also result from chemical reactions and can form in drugs either due to
the drug's manufacturing process, chemical structure, or the conditions in
which the drugs are stored or packaged. The Company detected a nitrosamine
identified as Nitroso-STG-19 (NTTP) in some batches of its sitagliptin-
containing medicines. The Company has engaged with major health authorities
around the world and has implemented additional quality controls to ensure its
portfolio of sitagliptin-containing products meet health authorities' interim
acceptable NTTP limits for continuing distribution of product to the market.
The Company is making progress in its efforts to reduce the level

of nitrosamines in its sitagliptin-containing medicines. However, difficulties
in reducing those levels, or achieving timely regulatory approvals for
required changes, could result in product shortages.

unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, offset by higher pricing, as well as
increased demand for ruminant and poultry products. Sales of companion animal
products declined 1% in 2022 reflecting the unfavorable effect of foreign
exchange and supply constraints for certain vaccines, largely offset by higher
pricing in the portfolio, as well as higher demand for the Bravecto line of
products, which had sales of $1.0 billion in 2022.

Cost of Sales

Cost of sales was $17.4 billion in 2022 and $13.6 billion in 2021. Cost of
sales includes $3.0 billion and $502 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively,
related to the collaboration with Ridgeback for Lagevrio (see Note 5 to the
consolidated financial statements). Cost of sales also includes the
amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions,
collaborations, and licensing arrangements, which totaled $2.0 billion in 2022
and $1.6 billion in 2021. Amortization expense in 2022 and 2021 includes $250
million and $153 million, respectively, of cumulative catch-up amortization
related to Merck's collaborations with AstraZeneca and Bayer, respectively
(see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). Additionally, costs in
2021 include charges of $225 million related to the discontinuation of
COVID-19 development programs (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements). Also included in cost of sales are expenses associated with
restructuring activities, which amounted to $205 million in 2022 and $160
million in 2021, primarily reflecting accelerated depreciation and asset
write-offs related to the planned sale or closure of manufacturing facilities.
Separation costs associated with manufacturing-related headcount reductions
have been incurred and are reflected in Restructuring costs as discussed
below.

Gross margin was 70.6% in 2022 compared with 72.0% in 2021. The gross margin
decline primarily reflects the unfavorable impacts of higher amortization of
intangible assets (noted above), as well as higher sales of Lagevrio and
revenue from third-party manufacturing arrangements, both of which have lower
gross margins. The gross margin decline was partially offset by the favorable
effects of product mix, foreign exchange and charges in 2021 related to the
discontinuation of COVID-19 development programs (noted above).

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $10.0 billion in
2022, an increase of 4% compared with 2021. The increase was primarily due to
higher administrative costs, as well as higher promotional spending and
selling costs, partially offset by the favorable effects of foreign exchange
and lower acquisition-related costs.

Research and Development

Research and development (R&D) expenses were $13.5 billion in 2022, an
increase of 11% compared with 2021 primarily due to higher intangible asset
impairment charges (largely related to nemtabrutinib), higher charges for
upfront and option payments related to collaborations and licensing
arrangements, higher compensation

and benefit costs reflecting in part increased headcount to support expanded
clinical development activity, and increased clinical development spending.
The increase in R&D expenses was partially offset by a charge in 2021 for the
acquisition of Pandion Therapeutics, Inc. (Pandion).

R&D expenses are comprised of the costs directly incurred by Merck Research
Laboratories (MRL), the Company's research and development division that
focuses on human health-related activities, which were $7.7 billion in 2022
and $7.1 billion in 2021. Also included in R&D expenses are Animal Health
research costs, licensing costs and costs incurred by other divisions in
support of R&D activities, including depreciation, production and general and
administrative, which in the aggregate were $4.1 billion in 2022 and $4.7
billion in 2021. The decrease in these expenses in 2022 largely reflects a
$1.7 billion charge in 2021 for the acquisition of Pandion, partially offset
by $690 million of upfront and option payments in the aggregate for
collaboration and licensing agreements with Moderna, Orna and Orion. See Note
4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related
to these business development transactions. R&D expenses also include
impairment charges of $1.7 billion and $275 million in 2022 and 2021,
respectively, largely related to nemtabrutinib (see Note 9 to the consolidated
financial statements). The Company may recognize additional impairment charges
in the future related to the cancellation or delay of other pipeline programs
that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with business
combinations and such charges could be material. R&D expenses also include
expense or income related to changes in the estimated fair value measurement
of liabilities for contingent consideration recorded in connection with
business combinations. The Company recorded a net reduction in expenses of $75
million in 2022 compared with $35 million of expenses in 2021 related to
changes in these estimates.

Restructuring Costs

In 2019, Merck approved a global restructuring program (Restructuring Program)
as part of a worldwide initiative focused on further optimizing the Company's
manufacturing and supply network, as well as reducing its global real estate
footprint. This program is a continuation of the Company's plant
rationalization and builds on prior restructuring programs. The actions
currently contemplated under the Restructuring Program are expected to be
substantially completed by the end of 2023, with the cumulative pretax costs
to be incurred by the Company to implement the program estimated to be
approximately $3.7 billion. Merck expects to record charges of approximately
$400 million in 2023 related to the Restructuring Program. The Company
anticipates the actions under the Restructuring Program will result in
cumulative annual net cost savings of approximately $900 million by the end of
2023.

Restructuring costs, primarily representing separation and other related costs
associated with these restructuring activities, were $337 million in 2022 and
$661 million in 2021. Separation costs incurred were associated with actual
headcount reductions, as well as estimated expenses under existing severance
programs for involuntary headcount reductions that were probable and could be
reasonably estimated. Also included in restructuring costs are asset
abandonment, facility shut-down and other related costs, as well as employee-
related costs such as curtailment, settlement and termination charges
associated with pension and other postretirement benefit plans and share-based
compensation plan costs. For segment reporting, restructuring costs are
unallocated expenses.

Additional costs associated with the Company's restructuring activities are
included in Cost of sales, Selling, general and administrative expenses and
Research and development costs. The Company recorded aggregate pretax costs of
$666 million in 2022 and $868 million in 2021 related to restructuring program
activities (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements).

Other (Income) Expense, Net

Other (income) expense, net, was $1.5 billion of expense in 2022 compared with
$1.3 billion of income in 2021 primarily due to net unrealized losses from
investments in equity securities in 2022 compared with net realized and
unrealized gains from investments in equity securities recorded in 2021.

For details on the components of Other (income) expense, net, see Note 15 to
the consolidated financial statements.

Pharmaceutical segment profits are comprised of segment sales less standard
costs, as well as SG&A expenses directly incurred by the segment. Animal
Health segment profits are comprised of segment sales, less all cost of sales,
as well as SG&A and R&D expenses directly incurred by the segment. For
internal management reporting presented to the chief operating decision maker,
Merck does not allocate the remaining cost of sales not included in segment
profits as described above, R&D expenses incurred by MRL, or general and
administrative expenses, nor the cost of financing these activities. Separate
divisions maintain responsibility for monitoring and managing these costs,
including depreciation related to fixed assets utilized by these divisions
and, therefore, they are not included in segment profits. Also excluded from
the determination of segment profits are costs related to restructuring
activities and acquisition and divestiture-related costs, including the
amortization of intangible assets and amortization of purchase accounting
adjustments, intangible asset impairment charges, and expense or income
related to changes in the estimated fair value measurement of liabilities for
contingent consideration. Additionally, segment profits do not reflect other
expenses from corporate and manufacturing cost centers and other miscellaneous
income or expense. These unallocated items are reflected in "Other" in the
above table. Also included in "Other" are miscellaneous corporate profits
(losses), as well as operating profits (losses) related to third-party
manufacturing arrangements.

Pharmaceutical segment profits grew 19% in 2022 primarily due to higher sales,
partially offset by higher administrative and promotional costs, as well as
the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. Animal Health segment profits grew
1% in 2022 reflecting lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher
selling and administrative costs and the unfavorable effect of foreign
exchange.

Taxes on Income

The effective income tax rates from continuing operations were 11.7% in 2022
and 11.0% in 2021. The tax rate from continuing operations in 2022 and 2021
reflect a favorable mix of income and expense. The tax rate from continuing
operations in 2022 also reflects the favorable impact of net unrealized losses
from investments in equity securities and intangible asset impairment charges,
which were taxed at the U.S. tax rate. These items reduced domestic pretax
income by approximately $2.9 billion in 2022. The tax rate from continuing
operations in 2021 also reflects higher foreign tax credits from ordinary
business operations that the Company was able to credit, the beneficial impact
of the settlement of a foreign tax matter, as well as a net tax benefit of
$207 million related to the settlement of certain federal income tax matters
(see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements). Additionally, the tax
rate from continuing operations in 2021 reflects the unfavorable effect of a
charge for the acquisition of Pandion for which no tax benefit was recognized.

Non-GAAP Income and Non-GAAP EPS from Continuing Operations

Non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are alternative views of the Company's
performance that Merck is providing because management believes this
information enhances investors' understanding of the Company's results since
management uses non-GAAP measures to assess performance. Non-GAAP income and
non-GAAP EPS exclude certain items because of the nature of these items and
the impact that they have on the analysis of underlying business performance
and trends. The excluded items (which should not be considered non-recurring)
consist of acquisition and divestiture-related costs, restructuring costs,
income and losses from investments in equity securities and certain other
items. These excluded items are significant components in understanding and
assessing financial performance.

Non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are important internal measures for the
Company. Senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results
that includes a non-GAAP EPS metric. Management uses non-GAAP measures
internally for planning and forecasting purposes and to measure the
performance of the Company along with other metrics. In addition, senior
management's annual compensation is derived in part using a non-GAAP pretax
income metric. Since non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are not measures
determined in accordance with GAAP, they have no standardized meaning
prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, may not be

56

* * *

Table of Contents

comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. The
information on non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS should be considered in
addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, net income and EPS
prepared in accordance with GAAP.

In 2022, the Company changed the treatment of certain items for purposes of
its non-GAAP reporting. Historically, Merck's non-GAAP results excluded
expenses for upfront and pre-approval milestone payments related to
collaborations and licensing agreements, as well as charges related to pre-
approval assets obtained in transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions,
to the extent the charges were considered by the Company to be significant to
the results of a particular period (as well as any related adjustments
recorded in a subsequent period). Merck's non-GAAP results no longer exclude
charges related to these items. Prior periods have been recast to conform to
the current presentation.

A reconciliation between GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial
measures (from continuing operations) is as follows:

(2) The estimated tax impact on the excluded items is determined by applying
the statutory rate of the originating territory of the non-GAAP adjustments.

Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Costs

Non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS exclude the impact of certain amounts
recorded in connection with acquisitions and divestitures of businesses. These
amounts include the amortization of intangible assets and amortization of
purchase accounting adjustments to inventories, as well as intangible asset
impairment charges, and expense or income related to changes in the estimated
fair value measurement of liabilities for contingent consideration. Also
excluded are integration, transaction, and certain other costs associated with
acquisitions and divestitures of businesses. Non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS
also exclude amortization of intangible assets related to collaborations and
licensing arrangements.

Restructuring Costs

Non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS exclude costs related to restructuring
actions (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). These amounts
include employee separation costs and accelerated depreciation associated with
facilities to be closed or divested. Accelerated depreciation costs represent
the difference between the depreciation expense to be recognized over the
revised useful life of the asset, based upon the anticipated date the site
will be closed or divested or the equipment disposed of, and depreciation
expense as determined utilizing the useful life prior to the restructuring
actions. Restructuring costs also include asset abandonment, facility shut-
down

57

and other related costs, as well as employee-related costs such as
curtailment, settlement and termination charges associated with pension and
other postretirement benefit plans and share-based compensation costs.

Income and Losses from Investments in Equity Securities

Non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS exclude realized and unrealized gains and
losses from investments in equity securities either owned directly or through
ownership interests in investment funds.

Certain Other Items

Non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS exclude certain other items. These items are
adjusted for after evaluating them on an individual basis, considering their
quantitative and qualitative aspects. Typically, these consist of items that
are unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or
not indicative of future operating results. Excluded from non-GAAP income and
non-GAAP EPS are charges related to the discontinuation of COVID-19
development programs (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements), as
well as a net tax benefit related to the settlement of certain federal income
tax matters (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements), and an
adjustment to tax benefits recorded in conjunction with the 2015 acquisition
of Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Research and Development

Research Pipeline

The Company currently has several candidates under regulatory review in the
U.S. and internationally, as well as in late-stage clinical development. A
chart reflecting the Company's current research pipeline as of February 17,
2023 and related discussion is set forth in Item 1\. "Business -- Research and
Development" above.

Acquisitions, Research Collaborations and Licensing Agreements

Merck continues to remain focused on pursuing opportunities that have the
potential to drive both near- and long-term growth. Certain recent
transactions are summarized below; additional details are included in Note 4
to the consolidated financial statements. Merck actively monitors the
landscape for growth opportunities that meet the Company's strategic criteria.

In February 2023, Merck and Kelun-Biotech closed a license and collaboration
agreement expanding their relationship in which Merck gained exclusive rights
for the research, development, manufacture and commercialization of up to
seven investigational preclinical ADCs for the treatment of cancer. Kelun-
Biotech retained the right to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize
certain licensed and option ADCs for Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Macau.
Merck will make an upfront payment of $175 million, which will be recorded in
Research and development expenses in 2023. In addition, Kelun-Biotech is
eligible to receive future contingent milestone payments and tiered royalties
on future net sales for any commercialized ADC product. Also, in connection
with the agreement, Merck invested $100 million in Kelun-Biotech's Series B
preferred shares in January 2023.

In January 2023, Merck acquired Imago, a clinical stage biopharmaceutical
company developing new medicines for the treatment of myeloproliferative
neoplasms and other bone marrow diseases, for $1.35 billion (including
payments to settle share-based equity awards) and also incurred approximately
$60 million of transaction costs. Imago's lead candidate bomedemstat, MK-3543
(formerly IMG-7289), is an investigational orally available lysine-specific
demethylase 1 inhibitor currently being evaluated in multiple Phase 2 clinical
trials for the treatment of essential thrombocythemia, myelofibrosis, and
polycythemia vera, in addition to other indications. The transaction was
accounted for as an acquisition of an asset. Merck will record net assets of
approximately $200 million and Research and development expenses of $1.2
billion in 2023 related to the transaction. There are no future contingent
payments associated with the acquisition.

In September 2022, Merck exercised its option to jointly develop and
commercialize personalized therapeutic cancer vaccine mRNA-4157/V940 pursuant
to the terms of an existing collaboration and license agreement with Moderna,
which resulted in a $250 million charge to Research and development expenses
in 2022. mRNA-4157/V940 is currently being evaluated in combination with
Keytruda as adjuvant treatment for patients with stage III/IV melanoma
following complete resection in a Phase 2 clinical trial being conducted by
Moderna. Merck and Moderna will collaborate on development and
commercialization and will share costs and any profits equally under this
worldwide collaboration. In February 2023, Merck and Moderna announced that
mRNA-4157/V940 was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA for the
adjuvant treatment of patients with high-risk melanoma following complete
resection.

In August 2022, Merck and Orna entered into a collaboration agreement to
discover, develop, and commercialize multiple programs, including vaccines and
therapeutics in the areas of infectious disease and oncology. Under the terms
of the agreement, Merck made an upfront payment to Orna of $150 million, which
was recorded in Research and development expenses in 2022. In addition, Orna
is eligible to receive future contingent

58

Table of Contents

development-related payments, as well as royalties on any approved products
derived from the collaboration. Merck also invested $100 million in Orna's
Series B preferred shares in 2022.

In July 2022, Merck and Orion announced a global co-development and co-
commercialization agreement for Orion's investigational candidate ODM-208
(MK-5684) and other drugs targeting cytochrome P450 11A1 (CYP11A1), an enzyme
important in steroid production. MK-5684 is an oral, non-steroidal inhibitor
of CYP11A1 currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial for the
treatment of patients with mCRPC. Merck made an upfront payment to Orion of
$290 million, which was recorded in Research and development expenses in 2022.

Also in July 2022, Merck and Kelun-Biotech closed a license and collaboration
agreement in which Merck gained exclusive worldwide rights for the
development, manufacture and commercialization of an investigational ADC
(MK-1200) for the treatment of solid tumors. Under the terms of the agreement,
Merck and Kelun-Biotech will collaborate on the early clinical development of
the investigational ADC. Merck made an upfront payment of $35 million, which
was recorded in Research and development expenses in 2022. Kelun-Biotech is
also eligible to receive future contingent milestone payments, as well as
tiered royalties on future net sales.

In May 2022, in connection with an existing arrangement, Merck exercised its
option to obtain an exclusive license outside of Chinese mainland, Hong Kong,
Macau and Taiwan for the development, manufacture and commercialization of
Kelun-Biotech's TROP2-targeting ADC programs, including its lead compound,
SKB-264 (MK-2870), which is currently in Phase 2 clinical development. Under
the terms of the agreement, Merck and Kelun-Biotech will collaborate on
certain early clinical development plans, including evaluating the potential
of MK-2870 as a monotherapy and in combination with Keytruda for advanced
solid tumors. Upon option exercise, Merck made a payment of $30 million, which
was recorded in Research and development expenses in 2022, and agreed to make
additional payments upon completion of specified project activities,
technology transfer, as well as payments to fund Kelun-Biotech's ongoing
research and development activities. In addition, Kelun-Biotech is eligible to
receive future contingent developmental and sales-based milestone payments and
royalties on future net sales.

Acquired In-Process Research and Development

In connection with business combinations, the Company has recorded the fair
value of in-process research projects which, at the time of acquisition, had
not yet reached technological feasibility. At December 31, 2022, the balance
of IPR&D was $7.7 billion, primarily consisting of MK-7962 (sotatercept), $6.4
billion; MK-7264 (gefapixant), $832 million; and MK-1026 (nemtabrutinib), $418
million. Sotatercept is in Phase 3 clinical development and the Company
anticipates filing sotatercept with regulatory authorities in 2023. Gefapixant
is under review in the U.S. and the EU. Nemtabrutinib is in Phase 2 clinical
development.

The IPR&D projects that remain in development are subject to the inherent
risks and uncertainties in drug development and it is possible that the
Company will not be able to successfully develop and complete the IPR&D
programs and profitably commercialize the underlying product candidates. The
time periods to receive approvals from the FDA and other regulatory agencies
are subject to uncertainty. Significant delays in the approval process, or the
Company's failure to obtain approval at all, would delay or prevent the
Company from realizing revenues from these products. Additionally, if the
IPR&D programs require additional clinical trial data than previously
anticipated, or if the programs fail or are abandoned during development, then
the Company will not recover the fair value of the IPR&D recorded as an asset
as of the acquisition date. If such circumstances were to occur, the Company's
future operating results could be adversely affected and the Company may
recognize impairment charges, which could be material.

In 2022, 2021, and 2020 the Company recorded IPR&D impairment charges within
Research and development expenses of $1.6 billion, $275 million and $90
million, respectively (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements).

Additional research and development will be required before any of the
remaining programs reach technological feasibility. The costs to complete the
research projects will depend on whether the projects are brought to their
final stages of development and are ultimately submitted to the FDA or other
regulatory agencies for approval.

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures were $4.4 billion in 2022, $4.4 billion in 2021 and $4.4
billion in 2020. Expenditures in the U.S. were $2.7 billion in 2022, $2.8
billion in 2021 and $2.6 billion in 2020. The Company plans to invest
approximately $20 billion in capital projects from 2021-2025, approximately
half of which relates to investments in the U.S., including expanding
manufacturing capacity for oncology, vaccine and animal health products.

Depreciation expense was $1.8 billion in 2022, $1.6 billion in 2021 and $1.7
billion in 2020, of which $1.3 billion in 2022, $1.1 billion in 2021 and $1.2
billion in 2020, related to locations in the U.S. Total depreciation expense
in 2022, 2021 and 2020 included accelerated depreciation of $120 million, $91
million and $268 million, respectively, associated with restructuring
activities (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements).

Analysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources

Merck's strong financial profile enables it to fund research and development,
focus on external alliances, support in-line products and maximize upcoming
launches while providing significant cash returns to shareholders.

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Selected Data| | | | |  
($ in millions)| 2022| | 2021| | 2020  
Working capital| $| 11,483 | | | $| 6,394 | | | $| 437 |  
Total debt to total liabilities and equity| 28.1 | %| | 31.3 | %| | 34.7 | %  
Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations to total debt|
0.6:1| | 0.4:1| | 0.2:1  
  
The increase in working capital in 2022 compared with 2021 is primarily due to
increased cash and investments reflecting strong operating performance. The
increase in working capital in 2021 compared with 2020 is primarily related to
decreased short-term debt.

Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $19.1
billion in 2022 compared with $13.1 billion in 2021. The increase in cash
provided by operating activities of continuing operations reflects stronger
operating performance. Cash provided by operating activities of continuing
operations was reduced by milestone and option payments related to certain
collaborations of $2.0 billion in 2022 and $435 million in 2021. Cash provided
by operating activities of continuing operations continues to be the Company's
primary source of funds to finance operating needs, with excess cash serving
as the primary source of funds to finance business development transactions,
capital expenditures, dividends paid to shareholders and treasury stock
purchases. The mandatory change in R&D capitalization rules that became
effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021 (related to the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA)), increased the amount of taxes the Company
pays in the U.S. beginning in 2022.

Cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was $5.0 billion in
2022 compared with $16.4 billion in 2021. The lower use of cash in investing
activities of continuing operations was primarily due to lower cash used for
acquisitions, partially offset by higher purchases of securities and other
investments coupled with lower proceeds from sales of securities and other
investments.

Cash used in financing activities of continuing operations was $9.1 billion in
2022 compared with cash provided by financing activities of continuing
operations of $3.1 billion in 2021. The change was primarily driven by the
cash distribution received in 2021 from Organon in connection with the spin-
off (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements), proceeds from the
issuance of debt in 2021 compared with no such proceeds in 2022, and higher
dividends paid to stockholders in 2022, partially offset by net repayments of
short-term borrowings and treasury stock purchases in 2021 that did not occur
in 2022.

In December 2021, the Company issued $8.0 billion principal amount of senior
unsecured notes consisting of $1.5 billion of 1.70% notes due 2027, $1.0
billion of 1.90% notes due 2028, $2.0 billion of 2.15% notes due 2031, $2.0
billion of 2.75% notes due 2051 and $1.5 billion of 2.90% notes due 2061.
Merck used the net proceeds from the offering of the 2027 notes, the 2031
notes, the 2051 notes and the 2061 notes for general corporate purposes,
including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings (including
commercial paper borrowings in connection with Merck's acquisition of
Acceleron), and other indebtedness. Merck has committed to allocate an amount
equal to the net proceeds of the offering of the notes due in 2028 to finance
or refinance, in whole or in part, projects and partnerships in the Company's
priority environmental, social and governance (ESG) areas.

In June 2020, the Company issued $4.5 billion principal amount of senior
unsecured notes consisting of $1.0 billion of 0.75% notes due 2026, $1.25
billion of 1.45% notes due 2030, $1.0 billion of 2.35% notes due 2040 and
$1.25 billion of 2.45% notes due 2050. Merck used the net proceeds from the
offering for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of
outstanding commercial paper borrowings and other indebtedness.

In 2022, the Company's $1.25 billion, 2.35% notes and the Company's $1.0
billion, 2.40% notes matured in accordance with their terms and were repaid.
In 2021, the Company's $1.15 billion, 3.875% notes and the Company's €1.0
billion, 1.125% notes matured in accordance with their terms and were repaid.
In 2020, the Company's $1.25 billion, 1.85% notes and $700 million floating-
rate notes matured in accordance with their terms and were repaid.

The Company has a $6.0 billion credit facility that matures in June 2026. The
facility provides backup liquidity for the Company's commercial paper
borrowing facility and is to be used for general corporate purposes. The
Company has not drawn funding from this facility.

The Company expects foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to
be met through existing cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flows
from operations, as well as commercial paper borrowings and long-term
borrowings if needed. Merck believes that its sources of financing will be
adequate to meet its future requirements. The Company's material cash
requirements arising in the normal course of business primarily include:

Debt Obligations and Interest Payments -- See Note 10 to the consolidated
financial statements for further detail of the Company's debt obligations and
the timing of expected future principal and interest payments.

Tax Liabilities -- In connection with the enactment of the TCJA, the Company
is required to pay a one-time transition tax, which the Company has elected to
pay over a period of eight years through 2025 as permitted under the TCJA.
Additionally, the Company has liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits,
including interest and penalties. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial
statements for further information pertaining to the transition tax and
liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits.

Operating Leases -- See Note 10 to consolidated financial statements for
further details of the Company's lease obligations and the timing of expected
future lease payments.

Contingent Milestone Payments -- The Company has an accrued liability for a
contingent sales-based milestone payment related to a collaboration with
AstraZeneca where payment has been deemed probable by the Company but remains
subject to the achievement of the related sales-based milestone. See Note 5 to
the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to
this sales-based milestone.

Purchase Obligations -- Purchase obligations are enforceable and legally
binding obligations for purchases of goods and services including minimum
inventory contracts, research and development and advertising. Purchase
obligations also include future inventory purchases the Company has committed
to in connection with certain divestitures. As of December 31, 2022, the
Company had total purchase obligations of $6.0 billion, of which $1.7 billion
is estimated to be payable in 2023.

In March 2021, the Company filed a securities registration statement with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the automatic shelf
registration process available to "well-known seasoned issuers" which is
effective for three years.

Effective as of November 3, 2009, the Company executed a full and
unconditional guarantee of the then existing debt of its subsidiary Merck
Sharp & Dohme Corp. (MSD) and MSD executed a full and unconditional guarantee
of the then existing debt of the Company (excluding commercial paper),
including for payments of principal and interest. These guarantees do not
extend to debt issued subsequent to that date.

The Company believes it maintains a conservative financial profile. The
Company places its cash and investments in instruments that meet high credit
quality standards, as specified in its investment policy guidelines. These
guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The
Company does not participate in any off-balance sheet arrangements involving
unconsolidated subsidiaries that provide financing or potentially expose the
Company to unrecorded financial obligations.

In November 2022, Merck's Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend,
declaring a quarterly dividend of $0.73 per share on the Company's outstanding
common stock for the first quarter of 2023 that was paid in January 2023. In
January 2023, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.73
per share on the Company's outstanding common stock for the second quarter of
2023 payable in April 2023.

In October 2018, Merck's Board of Directors authorized purchases of up to $10
billion of Merck's common stock for its treasury. The treasury stock purchase
authorization has no time limit and will be made over time in open-market
transactions, block transactions, on or off an exchange, or in privately
negotiated transactions. The Company did not purchase any shares of its common
stock for its treasury during 2022 under this program. As of December 31,
2022, the Company's remaining share repurchase authorization was $5.0 billion.
The Company anticipates making modest share repurchases under this program in
2023. The Company purchased $840 million and $1.3 billion of its common stock
during 2021 and 2020, respectively, under authorized share repurchase
programs.

Financial Instruments Market Risk Disclosures

The Company manages the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest
rate movements on its earnings, cash flows and fair values of assets and
liabilities through operational means and through the use of various financial
instruments, including derivative instruments.

A significant portion of the Company's revenues and earnings in foreign
affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. The objectives of
and accounting related to the Company's foreign currency risk management
program, as well as its interest rate risk management activities are discussed
below.

Table of Contents

Foreign Currency Risk Management

The Company has established revenue hedging, balance sheet risk management,
and net investment hedging programs to protect against volatility of future
foreign currency cash flows and changes in fair value caused by changes in
foreign exchange rates.

The objective of the revenue hedging program is to reduce the variability
caused by changes in foreign exchange rates that would affect the U.S. dollar
value of future cash flows derived from foreign currency denominated sales,
primarily the euro, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi. To achieve this
objective, the Company will hedge a portion of its forecasted foreign currency
denominated third-party and intercompany distributor entity sales (forecasted
sales) that are expected to occur over its planning cycle, typically no more
than two years into the future. The Company will layer in hedges over time,
increasing the portion of forecasted sales hedged as it gets closer to the
expected date of the forecasted sales. The portion of forecasted sales hedged
is based on assessments of cost-benefit profiles that consider natural
offsetting exposures, revenue and exchange rate volatilities and correlations,
and the cost of hedging instruments. The Company manages its anticipated
transaction exposure principally with purchased local currency put options,
forward contracts, and purchased collar options.

The fair values of these derivative contracts are recorded as either assets
(gain positions) or liabilities (loss positions) in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet. Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts are recorded each
period in either current earnings or Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (OCI),
depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge
transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. For derivatives that
are designated as cash flow hedges, the unrealized gains or losses on these
contracts are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) and
reclassified into Sales when the hedged anticipated revenue is recognized. For
those derivatives which are not designated as cash flow hedges, but serve as
economic hedges of forecasted sales, unrealized gains or losses are recorded
in Sales each period. The cash flows from both designated and non-designated
contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement
of Cash Flows. The Company does not enter into derivatives for trading or
speculative purposes.

Because Merck principally sells foreign currency in its revenue hedging
program, a uniform weakening of the U.S. dollar would yield the largest
overall potential loss in the market value of these hedge instruments. The
market value of Merck's hedges would have declined by an estimated $647
million and $648 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, from a
uniform 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar. The market value was determined
using a foreign exchange option pricing model and holding all factors except
exchange rates constant. Although not predictive in nature, the Company
believes that a 10% threshold reflects reasonably possible near-term changes
in Merck's major foreign currency exposures relative to the U.S. dollar.

The Company manages operating activities and net asset positions at each local
subsidiary in order to mitigate the effects of exchange on monetary assets and
liabilities. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other
than the functional currency of a given subsidiary are remeasured at spot
rates in effect on the balance sheet date with the effects of changes in spot
rates reported in Other (income) expense, net. The Company also uses a balance
sheet risk management program to mitigate the exposure of such assets and
liabilities from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange. Merck
principally utilizes forward exchange contracts to offset the effects of
exchange in developed country currencies, primarily the euro, Japanese yen,
British pound, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and Swiss franc. For
exposures in developing country currencies, including the Chinese renminbi,
the Company will enter into forward contracts to offset the effects of
exchange on exposures when it is deemed economical to do so based on a cost-
benefit analysis that considers the magnitude of the exposure, the volatility
of the exchange rate and the cost of the hedging instrument. The forward
contracts are not designated as hedges and are marked to market through Other
(income) expense, net. Accordingly, fair value changes in the forward
contracts help mitigate the changes in the value of the remeasured assets and
liabilities attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, except
to the extent of the spot-forward differences. These differences are not
significant due to the short-term nature of the contracts, which typically
have average maturities at inception of less than six months. The cash flows
from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows.

A sensitivity analysis to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar on foreign
currency denominated derivatives, investments and monetary assets and
liabilities indicated that if the U.S. dollar uniformly weakened by 10%
against all currency exposures of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021,
Income from Continuing Operations Before Taxes would have declined by
approximately $190 million and $125 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Because the Company was in a net short (payable) position relative to its
major foreign currencies after consideration of forward contracts, a uniform
weakening of the U.S. dollar will yield the largest overall potential net loss
in earnings due to exchange. This measurement assumes that a change in one
foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar would not affect other foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Although not predictive in nature, the
Company believes that a 10% threshold reflects reasonably possible near-term
changes in Merck's major foreign

currency exposures relative to the U.S. dollar. The cash flows from these
contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement
of Cash Flows.

The economy of Turkiye was determined to be hyperinflationary in 2022.
Consequently, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company began remeasuring the
monetary assets and liabilities of those operations in earnings beginning in
the second quarter of 2022. The impact to the Company's results is immaterial.

The Company also uses forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of its net
investment in foreign operations against movements in exchange rates. The
forward contracts are designated as hedges of the net investment in a foreign
operation. The unrealized gains or losses on these contracts are recorded in
foreign currency translation adjustment within OCI, and remain in AOCL until
either the sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the
subsidiary. The Company excludes certain portions of the change in fair value
of its derivative instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness
(excluded components). Changes in fair value of the excluded components are
recognized in OCI. The Company recognizes in earnings the initial value of the
excluded components on a straight-line basis over the life of the derivative
instrument, rather than using the mark-to-market approach. The cash flows from
these contracts are reported as investing activities in the Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows.

Foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency
debt. The Company's senior unsecured euro-denominated notes have been
designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of the net investment in
a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses
due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments are
included in foreign currency translation adjustment within OCI.

Interest Rate Risk Management

The Company may use interest rate swap contracts on certain investing and
borrowing transactions to manage its net exposure to interest rate changes and
to reduce its overall cost of borrowing. The Company does not use leveraged
swaps and, in general, does not leverage any of its investment activities that
would put principal at risk. The Company is not currently a party to any
interest rate swaps.

The Company's investment portfolio includes cash equivalents and short-term
investments, the market values of which are not significantly affected by
changes in interest rates. The market value of the Company's medium- to long-
term fixed-rate investments is modestly affected by changes in U.S. interest
rates. Changes in medium- to long-term U.S. interest rates have a more
significant impact on the market value of the Company's fixed-rate borrowings,
which generally have longer maturities. A sensitivity analysis to measure
potential changes in the market value of Merck's investments and debt from a
change in interest rates indicated that a one percentage point increase in
interest rates at December 31, 2022 and 2021 would have positively affected
the net aggregate market value of these instruments by $2.0 billion and $3.2
billion, respectively. A one percentage point decrease at December 31, 2022
and 2021 would have negatively affected the net aggregate market value by $2.4
billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. The fair value of Merck's debt was
determined using pricing models reflecting one percentage point shifts in the
appropriate yield curves. The fair values of Merck's investments were
determined using a combination of pricing and duration models.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity
with GAAP and, accordingly, include certain amounts that are based on
management's best estimates and judgments. Estimates are used when accounting
for amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions, including initial fair
value determinations of assets and liabilities in a business combination
(primarily IPR&D, other intangible assets and contingent consideration), as
well as subsequent fair value measurements. Additionally, estimates are used
in determining such items as provisions for sales discounts and returns,
depreciable and amortizable lives, recoverability of inventories, including
those produced in preparation for product launches, amounts recorded for
contingencies, environmental liabilities, accruals for contingent sales-based
milestone payments and other reserves, pension and other postretirement
benefit plan assumptions, share-based compensation assumptions, restructuring
costs, impairments of long-lived assets (including intangible assets and
goodwill) and investments, and taxes on income. Because of the uncertainty
inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.
Application of the following accounting policies result in accounting
estimates having the potential for the most significant impact on the
financial statements.

Acquisitions and Dispositions

To determine whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or
disposals) of assets or businesses, the Company makes certain judgments, which
include assessment of the inputs, processes, and outputs associated with the
acquired set of activities. If the Company determines that substantially all
of the fair value of gross

63

Table of Contents

assets included in a transaction is concentrated in a single asset (or a group
of similar assets), the assets would not represent a business. To be
considered a business, the assets in a transaction need to include an input
and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the
ability to create outputs.

In a business combination, the acquisition method of accounting requires that
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded as of the date of the
acquisition at their respective fair values with limited exceptions. The fair
values of intangible assets are determined utilizing information available
near the acquisition date based on expectations and assumptions that are
deemed reasonable by management. Given the considerable judgment involved in
determining fair values, the Company typically obtains assistance from third-
party valuation specialists for significant items. Assets acquired and
liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies
are generally recognized at fair value. If fair value cannot be determined,
the asset or liability is recognized if probable and reasonably estimable; if
these criteria are not met, no asset or liability is recognized. Fair value is
defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to
transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous
market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants on the measurement date. Accordingly, the Company may be required
to value assets at fair value measures that do not reflect the Company's
intended use of those assets. Any excess of the purchase price (consideration
transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded
as goodwill. Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company
are expensed as incurred. The operating results of the acquired business are
reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements after the date of
the acquisition.

The judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as well as asset
lives, can materially affect the Company's results of operations.

The fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to currently
marketed products and product rights are primarily determined by using an
income approach through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's
discounted projected net cash flows. The Company's estimates of market
participant net cash flows consider historical and projected pricing, margins
and expense levels; the performance of competing products where applicable;
relevant industry and therapeutic area growth drivers and factors; current and
expected trends in technology and product life cycles; the time and investment
that will be required to develop products and technologies; the ability to
obtain additional marketing and regulatory approvals; the ability to
manufacture and commercialize the products; the extent and timing of potential
new product introductions by the Company's competitors; and the life of each
asset's underlying patent and related patent term extension, if any. The net
cash flows are then probability-adjusted where appropriate to consider the
uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, as well as the risk
profile of the net cash flows utilized in the valuation. The probability-
adjusted future net cash flows of each product are then discounted to present
value utilizing an appropriate discount rate.

The fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to IPR&D are also
determined using an income approach, through which fair value is estimated
based on each asset's probability-adjusted future net cash flows, which
reflect the different stages of development of each product and the associated
probability of successful completion. The net cash flows are then discounted
to present value using an appropriate discount rate. Amounts allocated to
acquired IPR&D are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived
intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until completion or
abandonment of the projects. Upon successful completion of each IPR&D project,
Merck will make a determination as to the then-useful life of the intangible
asset, generally determined by the period in which the substantial majority of
the cash flows are expected to be generated, and begin amortization.

Certain of the Company's business combinations involve the potential for
future payment of consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of
performance milestones, including product development milestones and royalty
payments on future product sales. The fair value of contingent consideration
liabilities is determined at the acquisition date using unobservable inputs.
These inputs include the estimated amount and timing of projected cash flows,
the probability of success (achievement of the contingent event) and the risk-
adjusted discount rate used to present value the probability-weighted cash
flows. Subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting period until the
contingency is resolved, the contingent consideration liability is remeasured
at current fair value with changes (either expense or income) recorded in
earnings. Changes in any of the inputs may result in a significantly different
fair value adjustment.

If the Company determines the transaction will not be accounted for as an
acquisition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an asset
acquisition rather than a business combination and, therefore, no goodwill
will be recorded. In an asset acquisition, acquired IPR&D with no alternative
future use is charged to expense and contingent consideration is not
recognized at the acquisition date.

Contingent Sales-Based Milestones

The terms of certain collaborative arrangements require the Company to make
payments contingent upon the achievement of sales-based milestones. Sales-
based milestones payable by Merck to collaborative partners are accrued and
capitalized, subject to cumulative amortization catch-up, when determined to
be probable of being achieved by the Company based on future sales forecasts.
The amortization catch-up is calculated either from the time of the first
regulatory approval for indications that were unapproved at the time the
collaboration was formed, or from time of the formation of the collaboration
for approved products. The related intangible asset that is recognized is
amortized over its remaining useful life, subject to impairment testing.

Revenue Recognition

Recognition of revenue requires evidence of a contract, probable collection of
sales proceeds and completion of substantially all performance obligations.
Merck acts as the principal in substantially all of its customer arrangements
and therefore records revenue on a gross basis. The majority of the Company's
contracts related to the Pharmaceutical and Animal Health segments have a
single performance obligation - the promise to transfer goods. Shipping is
considered immaterial in the context of the overall customer arrangement and
damages or loss of goods in transit are rare. Therefore, shipping is not
deemed a separately recognized performance obligation.

The vast majority of revenues from sales of products are recognized at a point
in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which the
Company has determined is when title and risks and rewards of ownership
transfer to the customer and the Company is entitled to payment. For certain
services in the Animal Health segment, revenue is recognized over time,
generally ratably over the contract term as services are provided. These
service revenues are not material.

The nature of the Company's business gives rise to several types of variable
consideration including discounts and returns, which are estimated at the time
of sale generally using the expected value method, although the most likely
amount method is used for prompt pay discounts.

In the U.S., sales discounts are issued to customers at the point-of-sale,
through an intermediary wholesaler (known as chargebacks), or in the form of
rebates. Additionally, sales are generally made with a limited right of return
under certain conditions. Revenues are recorded net of provisions for sales
discounts and returns, which are established at the time of sale. In addition,
if collection of accounts receivable is expected to be in excess of one year,
sales are recorded net of time value of money discounts, which have not been
material.

The U.S. provision for aggregate customer discounts covers chargebacks and
rebates. Chargebacks are discounts that occur when a contracted customer
purchases through an intermediary wholesaler. The contracted customer
generally purchases product from the wholesaler at its contracted price plus a
mark-up. The wholesaler, in turn, charges the Company back for the difference
between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contract price paid
to the wholesaler by the customer. The provision for chargebacks is based on
expected sell-through levels by the Company's wholesale customers to
contracted customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels.
Rebates are amounts owed based upon definitive contractual agreements or legal
requirements with private sector and public sector (Medicaid and Medicare Part
D) benefit providers after the final dispensing of the product to a benefit
plan participant. The provision for rebates is based on expected patient
usage, as well as inventory levels in the distribution channel to determine
the contractual obligation to the benefit providers. The Company uses
historical customer segment utilization mix, sales forecasts, changes to
product mix and price, inventory levels in the distribution channel,
government pricing calculations and prior payment history in order to estimate
the expected provision. Amounts accrued for aggregate customer discounts are
evaluated on a quarterly basis through comparison of information provided by
the wholesalers, health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers,
federal and state agencies, and other customers to the amounts accrued. Merck
remains committed to the 340B Program and to providing 340B discounts to
eligible covered entities. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial
statements for information regarding 340B legal proceedings.

The Company continually monitors its provision for aggregate customer
discounts. There were no material adjustments to estimates associated with the
aggregate customer discount provision in 2022, 2021 or 2020.

Summarized information about changes in the aggregate customer discount
accrual related to U.S. sales is as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
($ in millions)| 2022| | 2021

Payments| (12,179)| | | (12,234)|  
Balance December 31| $| 2,918 | | | $| 2,844 |  
  
Accruals for chargebacks are reflected as a direct reduction to accounts
receivable and accruals for rebates as current liabilities. The accrued
balances relative to these provisions included in Accounts receivable and
Accrued and other current liabilities were $178 million and $2.7 billion,
respectively, at December 31, 2022 and were $207 million and $2.6 billion,
respectively, at December 31, 2021.

Outside of the U.S., variable consideration in the form of discounts and
rebates are a combination of commercially-driven discounts in highly
competitive product classes, discounts required to gain or maintain
reimbursement, or legislatively mandated rebates. In certain European
countries, legislatively mandated rebates are calculated based on an estimate
of the government's total unbudgeted spending and the Company's specific
payback obligation. Rebates may also be required based on specific product
sales thresholds. The Company applies an estimated factor against its actual
invoiced sales to represent the expected level of future discount or rebate
obligations associated with the sale.

The Company maintains a returns policy that allows its U.S. pharmaceutical
customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent
to the expiration date (generally, three to six months before and 12 months
after product expiration). The estimate of the provision for returns is based
upon historical experience with actual returns. Additionally, the Company
considers factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel,
product dating and expiration period, whether products have been discontinued,
entrance in the market of generic or other competition, changes in formularies
or launch of over-the-counter products, among others. The product returns
provision for U.S. pharmaceutical sales as a percentage of U.S. net
pharmaceutical sales was 1.1% in 2022, 0.9% in 2021 and 0.5% in 2020. Outside
of the U.S., returns are only allowed in certain countries on a limited basis.

Merck's payment terms for U.S. pharmaceutical customers are typically 36 days
from receipt of invoice and for U.S. animal health customers are typically 30
days from receipt of invoice; however, certain products, including Keytruda,
have longer payment terms, some of which are up to 90 days. Outside of the
U.S., payment terms are typically 30 days to 90 days, although certain markets
have longer payment terms.

Through its distribution programs with U.S. wholesalers, the Company
encourages wholesalers to align purchases with underlying demand and maintain
inventories below specified levels. The terms of the programs allow the
wholesalers to earn fees upon providing visibility into their inventory
levels, as well as by achieving certain performance parameters such as
inventory management, customer service levels, reducing shortage claims and
reducing product returns. Information provided through the wholesaler
distribution programs includes items such as sales trends, inventory on-hand,
on-order quantity and product returns.

Inventories Produced in Preparation for Product Launches

The Company capitalizes inventories produced in preparation for product
launches sufficient to support estimated initial market demand. Typically,
capitalization of such inventory does not begin until the related product
candidates are in Phase 3 clinical trials and regulatory approval is
considered by the Company to be probable. The Company monitors the status of
each respective product within the regulatory approval process; however, the
Company generally does not disclose specific timing for regulatory approval.
If the Company is aware of any specific risks or contingencies other than the
normal regulatory approval process or if there are any specific issues
identified during the research process relating to safety, efficacy,
manufacturing, marketing or labeling, the related inventory would generally
not be capitalized. Expiry dates of the inventory are affected by the stage of
completion. The Company manages the levels of inventory at each stage to
optimize the shelf life of the inventory in relation to anticipated market
demand in order to avoid product expiry issues. For inventories that are
capitalized, anticipated future sales and shelf lives support the realization
of the inventory value as the inventory shelf life is sufficient to meet
initial product launch requirements. Inventories produced in preparation for
product launches capitalized at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $516 million
and $256 million, respectively.

Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities

The Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature
considered normal to its business, including product liability, intellectual
property and commercial litigation, as well as certain additional matters
including governmental and environmental matters (see Note 11 to the
consolidated financial statements). The Company records accruals for
contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted periodically
as assessments change or additional information becomes available. For product
liability claims, a portion of the overall accrual is actuarially determined
and considers such factors as past experience, number of claims reported and
estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported. Individually significant
contingent losses are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable.

Legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss
contingency are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. Some of the
significant factors considered in the review of these legal defense reserves
are as follows: the actual costs incurred by the Company; the development of
the Company's legal defense strategy and structure in light of the scope of
its litigation; the number of cases being brought against the Company; the
costs and outcomes of completed trials and the most current information
regarding anticipated timing, progression, and related costs of pre-trial
activities and trials in the associated litigation. The amount of legal
defense reserves as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 of approximately $230
million represents the Company's best estimate of the minimum amount of
defense costs to be incurred in connection with its outstanding litigation;
however, events such as additional trials and other events that could arise in
the course of its litigation could affect the ultimate amount of legal defense
costs to be incurred by the Company. The Company will continue to monitor its
legal defense costs and review the adequacy of the associated reserves and may
determine to increase the reserves at any time in the future if, based upon
the factors set forth, it believes it would be appropriate to do so.

The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to a number of proceedings
brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and other federal and state
equivalents. When a legitimate claim for contribution is asserted, a liability
is initially accrued based upon the estimated transaction costs to manage the
site. Accruals are adjusted as site investigations, feasibility studies and
related cost assessments of remedial techniques are completed, and as the
extent to which other potentially responsible parties who may be jointly and
severally liable can be expected to contribute is determined.

The Company is also remediating environmental contamination resulting from
past industrial activity at certain of its sites and takes an active role in
identifying and accruing for these costs. In the past, Merck performed a
worldwide survey to assess all sites for potential contamination resulting
from past industrial activities. Where assessment indicated that physical
investigation was warranted, such investigation was performed, providing a
better evaluation of the need for remedial action. Where such need was
identified, remedial action was then initiated. As definitive information
became available during the course of investigations and/or remedial efforts
at each site, estimates were refined and accruals were established or adjusted
accordingly. These estimates and related accruals continue to be refined
annually.

The Company believes that there are no compliance issues associated with
applicable environmental laws and regulations that would have a material
adverse effect on the Company. Expenditures for remediation and environmental
liabilities were $4 million in 2022 and are estimated to be $23 million in the
aggregate for the years 2023 through 2027. In management's opinion, the
liabilities for all environmental matters that are probable and reasonably
estimable have been accrued and totaled $39 million and $40 million at
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These liabilities are undiscounted,
do not consider potential recoveries from other parties and will be paid out
over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, which are expected
to occur primarily over the next 15 years. Although it is not possible to
predict with certainty the outcome of these matters, or the ultimate costs of
remediation, management does not believe that any reasonably possible
expenditures that may be incurred in excess of the liabilities accrued should
exceed approximately $35 million in the aggregate. Management also does not
believe that these expenditures should result in a material adverse effect on
the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity for any
year.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company expenses all share-based payment awards to employees, including
grants of stock options, over the requisite service period based on the grant
date fair value of the awards. The Company determines the fair value of
certain share-based awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model which
uses both historical and current market data to estimate the fair value. This
method incorporates various assumptions such as the risk-free interest rate,
expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of the options.
Total pretax share-based compensation expense from continuing operations was
$541 million in 2022, $479 million in 2021 and $441 million in 2020. At
December 31, 2022, there was $813 million of total pretax unrecognized
compensation expense related to nonvested stock option, restricted stock unit
and performance share unit awards which will be recognized over a

67

weighted-average period of 1.9 years. For segment reporting, share-based
compensation costs are unallocated expenses.

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

Net periodic benefit cost for pension plans totaled $554 million in 2022, $748
million in 2021 and $450 million in 2020. Net periodic benefit credit for
other postretirement benefit plans was $93 million in 2022, $83 million in
2021 and $59 million in 2020. Pension and other postretirement benefit plan
information for financial reporting purposes is calculated using actuarial
assumptions including a discount rate for plan benefit obligations and an
expected rate of return on plan assets. The changes in net periodic benefit
cost year over year for pension plans are primarily attributable to changes in
the discount rates. Additionally, net periodic benefit costs in 2022 and 2021
reflect higher settlement charges incurred by certain plans compared with
2020.

The Company reassesses its benefit plan assumptions on a regular basis. For
both the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the discount rate is
evaluated on measurement dates and modified to reflect the prevailing market
rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income debt instruments that would
provide the future cash flows needed to pay the benefits included in the
benefit obligation as they come due. The discount rates for the Company's U.S.
pension and other postretirement benefit plans ranged from 5.50% to 5.90% at
December 31, 2022, compared with a range of 2.60% to 3.10% at December 31,
2021.

The expected rate of return for both the pension and other postretirement
benefit plans represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan
assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to
be paid. In developing the expected rate of return, the Company considers
long-term compound annualized returns of historical market data, current
market conditions and actual returns on the Company's plan assets. Using this
reference information, the Company develops forward-looking return
expectations for each asset category and a weighted-average expected long-term
rate of return for a target portfolio allocated across these investment
categories. The expected portfolio performance reflects the contribution of
active management as appropriate. For 2023, the expected rate of return for
the Company's U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans will be
7.00% compared to 6.70% in 2022.

The Company has established investment guidelines for its U.S. pension and
other postretirement plans to create an asset allocation that is expected to
deliver a rate of return sufficient to meet the long-term obligation of each
plan, given an acceptable level of risk. The target investment portfolio of
the Company's U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans is allocated
25% to 40% in U.S. equities, 10% to 20% in international equities, 35% to 45%
in fixed-income investments, and up to 8% in cash and other investments. The
portfolio's equity weighting is consistent with the long-term nature of the
plans' benefit obligations. The expected annual standard deviation of returns
of the target portfolio, which approximates 10%, reflects both the equity
allocation and the diversification benefits among the asset classes in which
the portfolio invests. For international pension plans, the targeted
investment portfolio varies based on the duration of pension liabilities and
local government rules and regulations. Although a significant percentage of
plan assets are invested in U.S. equities, concentration risk is mitigated
through the use of strategies that are diversified within management
guidelines.

Actuarial assumptions are based upon management's best estimates and judgment.
A reasonably possible change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the discount
rate assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have had an
estimated $81 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the Company's net
periodic benefit cost in 2022. A reasonably possible change of plus (minus) 25
basis points in the expected rate of return assumption, with other assumptions
held constant, would have had an estimated $59 million favorable (unfavorable)
impact on Merck's net periodic benefit cost in 2022. Required funding
obligations for 2023 relating to the Company's pension and other
postretirement benefit plans are not expected to be material. The preceding
hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected rate of return
assumptions would not impact the Company's funding requirements.

Net gain/loss amounts, which primarily reflect differences between expected
and actual returns on plan assets as well as the effects of changes in
actuarial assumptions, are recorded as a component of AOCL. Expected returns
for pension plans are based on a calculated market-related value of assets.
Net gain/loss amounts in AOCL in excess of certain thresholds are amortized
into net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service life of
employees.

Restructuring Costs

Restructuring costs have been recorded in connection with restructuring
programs designed to streamline the Company's cost structure. As a result, the
Company has made estimates and judgments regarding its future plans, including
future termination benefits to be incurred in conjunction with involuntary
separations when such separations are probable and estimable. When accruing
termination costs, the Company will recognize the amount within a range of
costs that is the best estimate within the range. When no amount within the
range is a better

68

* * *

Table of Contents

estimate than any other amount, the Company recognizes the minimum amount
within the range. In connection with these actions, management also assesses
the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business. In certain
instances, asset lives have been shortened based on changes in the expected
useful lives of the affected assets. Severance and other related costs are
reflected within Restructuring costs. Asset-related charges are reflected
within Cost of sales, Selling, general and administrative expenses and
Research and development expenses depending upon the nature of the asset.

Impairments of Long-Lived Assets

The Company assesses changes in economic, regulatory and legal conditions and
makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the
value of the Company's property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other
intangible assets.

The Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances
indicate that the carrying values of its long-lived assets to be held and used
may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an
estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows of these assets, or appropriate
asset groupings, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an
impairment exists. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is
measured based on the difference between the asset's fair value and its
carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company will
estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows
approach.

Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair
value of net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is assigned to reporting
units and evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more
frequently if impairment indicators exist, by first assessing qualitative
factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of
a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors
considered in the assessment include general macroeconomic conditions,
conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors which could have
a significant effect on earnings or cash flows, the overall financial
performance of the reporting unit, and whether there have been sustained
declines in the Company's share price. If the Company concludes it is more
likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its
carrying amount, a quantitative fair value test is performed. If the carrying
value of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, a goodwill
impairment charge will be recorded for the difference (up to the carrying
value of goodwill).

Other acquired intangible assets (excluding IPR&D) are initially recorded at
fair value, assigned an estimated useful life, and amortized primarily on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. When events or
circumstances warrant a review, the Company will assess recoverability from
future operations using pretax undiscounted cash flows derived from the lowest
appropriate asset groupings. Impairments are recognized in operating results
to the extent that the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair
value, which is determined based on the net present value of estimated future
cash flows.

IPR&D that the Company acquires in conjunction with the acquisition of a
business represents the fair value assigned to incomplete research projects
which, at the time of acquisition, have not reached technological feasibility.
The amounts are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible
assets, subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the
projects. The Company evaluates IPR&D for impairment at least annually, or
more frequently if impairment indicators exist (such as unfavorable clinical
trial data, changes in the commercial landscape or delays in the clinical
development program and related regulatory filing and approval timelines), by
performing a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the IPR&D
intangible asset with its carrying value. For impairment testing purposes, the
Company may combine separately recorded IPR&D intangible assets into one unit
of account based on the relevant facts and circumstances. Generally, the
Company will combine IPR&D intangible assets for testing purposes if they
operate as a single asset and are essentially inseparable. If the fair value
is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized in
operating results.

The judgments made in evaluating impairment of long-lived intangibles can
materially affect the Company's results of operations.

Taxes on Income

The Company's effective tax rate is based on pretax income, statutory tax
rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in
which the Company operates. An estimated effective tax rate for a year is
applied to the Company's quarterly operating results. In the event that there
is a significant unusual or one-time item recognized, or expected to be
recognized, in the Company's quarterly operating results, the tax attributable
to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as
the unusual or one-time item. The Company considers the resolution of prior
year tax matters to be such items. Significant judgment is required in
determining the Company's tax provision and in evaluating its tax positions.
The recognition and measurement of a tax position is based on management's
best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the
reporting date. The Company evaluates tax positions to determine whether the
benefits of tax positions are more

69

Table of Contents

likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of
the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being
sustained upon audit, the Company recognizes the amount of the benefit that is
greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in the
financial statements. For tax positions that are not more likely than not of
being sustained upon audit, the Company does not recognize any portion of the
benefit in the financial statements. If the more likely than not threshold is
not met in the period for which a tax position is taken, the Company may
subsequently recognize the benefit of that tax position if the tax matter is
effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires, or if the more likely
than not threshold is met in a subsequent period (see Note 16 to the
consolidated financial statements).

Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different
times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Timing
differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets
generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the
tax return in future years for which the Company has already recorded the tax
benefit in the financial statements. The Company establishes valuation
allowances for its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future
taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit.
Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the
financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which
the Company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet
recognized as expense in the financial statements.

Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results

This report and other written reports and oral statements made from time to
time by the Company may contain so-called "forward-looking statements," all of
which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks
and uncertainties which may cause results to differ materially from those set
forth in the statements. One can identify these forward-looking statements by
their use of words such as "anticipates," "expects," "plans," "will,"
"estimates," "forecasts," "projects" and other words of similar meaning, or
negative variations of any of the foregoing. One can also identify them by the
fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These
statements are likely to address the Company's growth strategy, financial
results, product approvals, product potential, development programs,
environmental or other sustainability initiatives, and may include statements
related to the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. One must carefully
consider any such statement and should understand that many factors could
cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's forward-looking
statements. These factors include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety
of other risks and uncertainties, including some that are known and some that
are not. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual future
results may vary materially.

The Company does not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking
statement. One should carefully evaluate such statements in light of factors,
including risk factors, described in the Company's filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, especially on this Form 10-K and Forms 10-Q and 8-K.
In Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of this annual report on Form 10-K the Company
discusses in more detail various important risk factors that could cause
actual results to differ from expected or historic results. The Company notes
these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. One should understand that it is not possible to predict
or identify all such factors. Consequently, the reader should not consider any
such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Merck & Co., Inc. and Subsidiaries

($ in millions except per share amounts)

1. Nature of Operations

Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck or the Company) is a global health care company that
delivers innovative health solutions through its prescription medicines,
including biologic therapies, vaccines and animal health products. The
Company's operations are principally managed on a product basis and include
two operating segments, Pharmaceutical and Animal Health, both of which are
reportable segments.

The Pharmaceutical segment includes human health pharmaceutical and vaccine
products. Human health pharmaceutical products consist of therapeutic and
preventive agents, generally sold by prescription, for the treatment of human
disorders. The Company sells these human health pharmaceutical products
primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies
and managed health care providers such as health maintenance organizations,
pharmacy benefit managers and other institutions. Human health vaccine
products consist of preventive pediatric, adolescent and adult vaccines. The
Company sells these human health vaccines primarily to physicians,
wholesalers, physician distributors and government entities.

The Animal Health segment discovers, develops, manufactures and markets a wide
range of veterinary pharmaceutical and vaccine products, as well as health
management solutions and services, for the prevention, treatment and control
of disease in all major livestock and companion animal species. The Company
also offers an extensive suite of digitally connected identification,
traceability and monitoring products. The Company sells its products to
veterinarians, distributors, animal producers, farmers and pet owners.

Spin-Off of Organon & Co.

On June 2, 2021, Merck completed the spin-off of products from its women's
health, biosimilars and established brands businesses into a new, independent,
publicly traded company named Organon & Co. (Organon) through a distribution
of Organon's publicly traded stock to Company shareholders. The distribution
is expected to qualify and has been treated as tax-free to the Company and its
shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The established brands
included in the transaction consisted of dermatology, non-opioid pain
management, respiratory, select cardiovascular products, as well as the rest
of Merck's diversified brands franchise. Merck's existing research pipeline
programs continue to be owned and developed within Merck as planned. The
historical results of the businesses that were contributed to Organon in the
spin-off have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Company's
consolidated financial statements through the date of the spin-off (see Note
3).

2. Summary of Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation -- The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling
interest is maintained. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.
Controlling interest is determined by majority ownership interest and the
absence of substantive third-party participating rights or, in the case of
variable interest entities, by majority exposure to expected losses, residual
returns or both. For those consolidated subsidiaries where Merck ownership is
less than 100%, the outside shareholders' interests are shown as
Noncontrolling interests in equity. Investments in affiliates over which the
Company has significant influence but not a controlling interest, such as
interests in entities owned equally by the Company and a third party that are
under shared control, are carried on the equity basis.

Acquisitions -- In a business combination, the acquisition method of
accounting requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be
recorded as of the date of the acquisition at their respective fair values
with limited exceptions. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
combination that arise from contingencies are generally recognized at fair
value. If fair value cannot be determined, the asset or liability is
recognized if probable and reasonably estimable; if these criteria are not
met, no asset or liability is recognized. Fair value is defined as the
exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a
liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the
asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on
the measurement date. Accordingly, the Company may be required to value assets
at fair value measures that do not reflect the Company's intended use of those
assets. Any excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the
estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed
as incurred. The operating results of the acquired business are reflected in
the Company's consolidated financial statements after the date of the
acquisition. If the Company determines the assets acquired do not meet the
definition of a business under the acquisition method of accounting, the
transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition of assets rather than a
business combination and, therefore, no

75

Table of Contents

goodwill will be recorded. In an asset acquisition, acquired in-process
research and development (IPR&D) with no alternative future use is charged to
expense and contingent consideration is not recognized at the acquisition
date.

Foreign Currency Translation -- The net assets of international subsidiaries
where the local currencies have been determined to be the functional
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates and
results of operations are translated at average exchange rates. The U.S.
dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these
subsidiaries at changing rates are recorded in Other Comprehensive Income
(OCI) and remain in Accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) until either
the sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the subsidiary.
For those subsidiaries that operate in highly inflationary economies and for
those subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar has been determined to be the
functional currency, non-monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities are
translated using historical rates, while monetary assets and liabilities are
translated at current rates, with the U.S. dollar effects of rate changes
included in Other (income) expense, net.

Cash Equivalents -- Cash equivalents are comprised of certain highly liquid
investments with original maturities of less than three months.

Inventories -- Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable
value. The cost of a substantial majority of U.S. human health inventories is
determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for both financial
reporting and tax purposes. The cost of all other inventories is determined
using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventories consist of currently
marketed products, as well as certain inventories produced in preparation for
product launches that are considered by the Company to be probable of
obtaining regulatory approval. In evaluating the recoverability of inventories
produced in preparation for product launches, the Company considers the
likelihood that revenue will be obtained from the future sale of the related
inventory together with the status of the product within the regulatory
approval process.

Investments -- Investments in marketable debt securities classified as
available-for-sale are reported at fair value. Fair values of the Company's
investments in marketable debt securities are determined using quoted market
prices in active markets for identical assets or quoted prices for similar
assets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by
observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or
liabilities. Changes in fair value that are not impairment related are
reported net of taxes in OCI. The Company considers available evidence in
evaluating potential impairments of its investments in marketable debt
securities, including the extent to which fair value is less than cost,
whether an allowance for credit loss is required, as well as adverse factors
that could affect the value of the securities. An impairment has occurred if
the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the
marketable debt security. If the Company does not intend to sell the impaired
debt security, and it is not more likely than not it will be required to sell
the debt security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amount
of the impairment recognized in earnings, recorded in Other (income) expense,
net is limited to the portion attributed to credit loss. The remaining portion
of the impairment related to other factors is recognized in OCI. Realized
gains and losses for debt securities are included in Other (income) expense,
net.

Investments in publicly traded equity securities are reported at fair value
determined using quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets
or quoted prices for similar assets or other inputs that are observable or can
be corroborated by observable market data. Changes in fair value are included
in Other (income) expense, net. Unrealized gains and losses from investments
that are directly owned are determined at the end of the reporting period.
Gains and losses from ownership interests in investment funds, which are
accounted for as equity method investments, are reported on a one quarter lag.
Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are
recorded at cost, plus or minus subsequent observable price changes in orderly
transactions for identical or similar investments, minus impairments. Such
adjustments are recognized in Other (income) expense, net. Realized gains and
losses for equity securities are included in Other (income) expense, net.

Revenue Recognition -- Recognition of revenue requires evidence of a contract,
probable collection of sales proceeds and completion of substantially all
performance obligations. Merck acts as the principal in substantially all of
its customer arrangements and therefore records revenue on a gross basis. The
majority of the Company's contracts related to the Pharmaceutical and Animal
Health segments have a single performance obligation - the promise to transfer
goods. Shipping is considered immaterial in the context of the overall
customer arrangement and damages or loss of goods in transit are rare.
Therefore, shipping is not deemed a separately recognized performance
obligation.

The vast majority of revenues from sales of products are recognized at a point
in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which the
Company has determined is when title and risks and rewards of ownership
transfer to the customer and the Company is entitled to payment. The Company
recognizes revenue from the sales of vaccines to the Federal government for
placement into vaccine stockpiles in accordance with Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) Interpretation, Commission Guidance Regarding Accounting for
Sales of Vaccines

76

Table of Contents

and BioTerror Countermeasures to the Federal Government for Placement into the
Pediatric Vaccine Stockpile or the Strategic National Stockpile. This
interpretation allows companies to recognize revenue for sales of vaccines
into U.S. government stockpiles even though these sales might not meet the
criteria for revenue recognition under other accounting guidance. Some
customers have bill-and-hold arrangements with the Company. Revenue for bill-
and-hold arrangements is recognized when control transfers to the customer
even though the customer does not yet have physical possession of the goods.
Control transfers when the bill-and-hold arrangement has been requested by the
customer, the product is identified as belonging to the customer and is ready
for physical transfer, the product cannot be directed for use by anyone but
the customer and, in certain circumstances, the customer has inspected and
accepted the product at the Company's facility. For certain services in the
Animal Health segment, revenue is recognized over time, generally ratably over
the contract term as services are provided. These service revenues are not
material.

The nature of the Company's business gives rise to several types of variable
consideration including discounts and returns, which are estimated at the time
of sale generally using the expected value method, although the most likely
amount method is used for prompt pay discounts.

In the U.S., sales discounts are issued to customers at the point-of-sale,
through an intermediary wholesaler (known as chargebacks), or in the form of
rebates. Additionally, sales are generally made with a limited right of return
under certain conditions. Revenues are recorded net of provisions for sales
discounts and returns, which are established at the time of sale. In addition,
if collection of accounts receivable is expected to be in excess of one year,
sales are recorded net of time value of money discounts, which have not been
material.

The U.S. provision for aggregate customer discounts covering chargebacks and
rebates was $12.3 billion in 2022, $12.3 billion in 2021 and $11.4 billion in
2020. Chargebacks are discounts that occur when a contracted customer
purchases through an intermediary wholesaler. The contracted customer
generally purchases product from the wholesaler at its contracted price plus a
mark-up. The wholesaler, in turn, charges the Company back for the difference
between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contract price paid
to the wholesaler by the customer. The provision for chargebacks is based on
expected sell-through levels by the Company's wholesale customers to
contracted customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels.
Rebates are amounts owed based upon definitive contractual agreements or legal
requirements with private sector and public sector (Medicaid and Medicare Part
D) benefit providers after the final dispensing of the product to a benefit
plan participant. The provision for rebates is based on expected patient
usage, as well as inventory levels in the distribution channel to determine
the contractual obligation to the benefit providers. The Company uses
historical customer segment utilization mix, sales forecasts, changes to
product mix and price, inventory levels in the distribution channel,
government pricing calculations and prior payment history in order to estimate
the expected provision. Amounts accrued for aggregate customer discounts are
evaluated on a quarterly basis through comparison of information provided by
the wholesalers, health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers,
federal and state agencies, and other customers to the amounts accrued. The
accrued balances relative to the provisions for chargebacks and rebates
included in Accounts receivable and Accrued and other current liabilities were
$178 million and $2.7 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2022 and were
$207 million and $2.6 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2021.

Outside of the U.S., variable consideration in the form of discounts and
rebates are a combination of commercially-driven discounts in highly
competitive product classes, discounts required to gain or maintain
reimbursement, or legislatively mandated rebates. In certain European
countries, legislatively mandated rebates are calculated based on an estimate
of the government's total unbudgeted spending and the Company's specific
payback obligation. Rebates may also be required based on specific product
sales thresholds. The Company applies an estimated factor against its actual
invoiced sales to represent the expected level of future discount or rebate
obligations associated with the sale.

The Company maintains a returns policy that allows its U.S. pharmaceutical
customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent
to the expiration date (generally, three to six months before and 12 months
after product expiration). The estimate of the provision for returns is based
upon historical experience with actual returns. Additionally, the Company
considers factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel,
product dating and expiration period, whether products have been discontinued,
entrance in the market of generic or other competition, changes in formularies
or launch of over-the-counter products, among others. Outside of the U.S.,
returns are only allowed in certain countries on a limited basis.

Merck's payment terms for U.S. pharmaceutical customers are typically 36 days
from receipt of invoice and for U.S. animal health customers are typically 30
days from receipt of invoice; however, certain products, including Keytruda,
have longer payment terms, some of which are up to 90 days. Outside of the
U.S., payment terms are typically 30 days to 90 days, although certain markets
have longer payment terms.

See Note 19 for disaggregated revenue disclosures.

Table of Contents

Depreciation -- Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of
the assets, principally using the straight-line method. For tax purposes,
accelerated tax methods are used. The estimated useful lives primarily range
from 25 to 40 years for Buildings, and from 3 to 15 years for Machinery,
equipment and office furnishings. Depreciation expense was $1.8 billion in
2022, $1.6 billion in 2021 and $1.7 billion in 2020.

Advertising and Promotion Costs -- Advertising and promotion costs are
expensed as incurred. The Company recorded advertising and promotion expenses
of $2.2 billion in 2022, $2.0 billion in 2021 and $1.8 billion in 2020.

Software Capitalization -- The Company capitalizes certain costs incurred in
connection with obtaining or developing internal-use software including
external direct costs of material and services, and payroll costs for
employees directly involved with the software development. These costs are
included in Property, plant and equipment. In addition, the Company
capitalizes certain costs incurred to implement a cloud computing arrangement
that is considered a service agreement, which are included in Other Assets.
Capitalized software costs are being amortized over periods ranging from 3 to
10 years, with the longer lives generally associated with enterprise-wide
projects implemented over multiple years. Costs incurred during the
preliminary project stage and post-implementation stage, as well as
maintenance and training costs, are expensed as incurred.

Goodwill -- Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred
over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is assigned
to reporting units and evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis,
or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, by first assessing
qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the
fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the
Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a
reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative fair value
test is performed. If the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than
its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the
difference (up to the carrying value of goodwill).

Acquired Intangibles -- Intangibles acquired in a business combination include
products and product rights, trade names and patents, licenses and other,
which are initially recorded at fair value, assigned an estimated useful life,
and amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives ranging from 2 to 24 years. The Company periodically evaluates whether
current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of its
acquired intangibles may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are
determined to exist, an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows of
these assets, or appropriate asset groupings, is compared to the carrying
value to determine whether an impairment exists. If the asset is determined to
be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the carrying
value of the intangible asset and its fair value, which is determined based on
the net present value of estimated future cash flows.

Acquired In-Process Research and Development -- IPR&D that the Company
acquires in conjunction with the acquisition of a business represents the fair
value assigned to incomplete research projects which, at the time of
acquisition, have not reached technological feasibility. The amounts are
capitalized and are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets,
subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects.
Upon successful completion of each IPR&D project, Merck will make a
determination as to the then-useful life of the intangible asset, generally
determined by the period in which the substantial majority of the cash flows
are expected to be generated, and begin amortization. The Company evaluates
IPR&D for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment
indicators exist, by performing a quantitative test that compares the fair
value of the IPR&D intangible asset with its carrying value. If the fair value
is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized in
operating results.

Contingent Consideration -- Certain of the Company's acquisitions involve the
potential for future payment of consideration that is contingent upon the
achievement of performance milestones, including product development
milestones and royalty payments on future product sales. If the transaction is
accounted for as a business combination, the fair value of contingent
consideration liabilities is determined at the acquisition date using
unobservable inputs. These inputs include the estimated amount and timing of
projected cash flows, the probability of success (achievement of the
contingent event) and the risk-adjusted discount rate used to present value
the probability-weighted cash flows. Subsequent to the acquisition date, at
each reporting period until the contingency is resolved, the contingent
consideration liability is remeasured at current fair value with changes
(either expense or income) recorded in earnings. Significant events that
increase or decrease the probability of achieving development and regulatory
milestones or that increase or decrease projected cash flows will result in
corresponding increases or decreases in the fair values of the related
contingent consideration obligations.

Research and Development -- Research and development is expensed as incurred.
Nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in
future research and development activities are

78

* * *

Table of Contents

expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been
received rather than when the payment is made. Research and development
expenses include restructuring costs and IPR&D impairment charges. In
addition, research and development expenses include expense or income related
to changes in the estimated fair value measurement of liabilities for
contingent consideration associated with IPR&D assets. Research and
development expenses also include upfront and milestone payments related to
asset acquisitions and licensing transactions involving clinical development
programs that have not yet received regulatory approval.

Collaborative Arrangements -- Merck has entered into collaborative
arrangements that provide the Company with varying rights to develop, produce
and market products together with its collaborative partners. When Merck is
the principal on sales transactions with third parties, the Company recognizes
sales, cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses on a
gross basis. Profit sharing amounts it pays to its collaborative partners are
recorded within Cost of sales. When the collaborative partner is the principal
on sales transactions with third parties, the Company records profit sharing
amounts received from its collaborative partners as alliance revenue (within
Sales). Alliance revenue is recorded net of cost of sales and includes an
adjustment to share commercialization costs between the partners in accordance
with the collaboration agreement. The adjustment is determined by comparing
the commercialization costs Merck has incurred directly and reported within
Selling, general and administrative expenses with the costs the collaborative
partner has incurred. Research and development costs Merck incurs related to
collaborations are recorded within Research and development expenses. Cost
reimbursements to the collaborative partner or payments received from the
collaborative partner to share these costs pursuant to the terms of the
collaboration agreements are recorded as increases or decreases to Research
and development expenses.

In addition, the terms of the collaboration agreements may require the Company
to make payments based upon the achievement of certain developmental,
regulatory approval or commercial milestones. Upfront and milestone payments
payable by Merck to collaborative partners prior to regulatory approval are
expensed as incurred and included in Research and development expenses.
Payments due to collaborative partners upon or subsequent to regulatory
approval are capitalized and amortized to Cost of sales over the estimated
useful life of the corresponding intangible asset provided that future cash
flows support the amounts capitalized. Sales-based milestones payable by Merck
to collaborative partners are accrued and capitalized, subject to cumulative
amortization catch-up, when determined to be probable of being achieved by the
Company. The amortization catch-up is calculated either from the time of the
first regulatory approval for indications that were unapproved at the time the
collaboration was formed, or from time of the formation of the collaboration
for approved products. The related intangible asset that is recognized is
amortized to Cost of sales over its remaining useful life, subject to
impairment testing.

Share-Based Compensation -- The Company expenses all share-based payments to
employees over the requisite service period based on the grant-date fair value
of the awards.

Restructuring Costs -- The Company records liabilities for costs associated
with exit or disposal activities in the period in which the liability is
incurred. In accordance with existing benefit arrangements, future employee
termination costs to be incurred in conjunction with involuntary separations
are accrued when such separations are probable and estimable. When accruing
these costs, the Company will recognize the amount within a range of costs
that is the best estimate within the range. When no amount within the range is
a better estimate than any other amount, the Company recognizes the minimum
amount within the range. Costs for one-time termination benefits in which the
employee is required to render service until termination in order to receive
the benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period.

Contingencies and Legal Defense Costs -- The Company records accruals for
contingencies and legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection
with a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred
and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

Taxes on Income -- Deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of
temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting based on
enacted tax laws and rates. The Company evaluates tax positions to determine
whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not of being
sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For
tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the
Company recognizes the amount of the benefit that is greater than 50% likely
of being realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. For
tax positions that are not more likely than not of being sustained upon audit,
the Company does not recognize any portion of the benefit in the financial
statements. The Company recognizes interest and penalties associated with
uncertain tax positions as a component of Taxes on Income from Continuing
Operations. The Company accounts for the tax effects of the tax on global
intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) of certain foreign subsidiaries in the
income tax provision in the period the tax arises. The Company's policy for
releasing disproportionate income tax effects from AOCL is to utilize the
item-by-item approach.

Reclassifications -- Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year
amounts to conform to the current year presentation.

Use of Estimates -- The consolidated financial statements are prepared in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP)
and, accordingly, include certain amounts that are based on management's best
estimates and judgments. Estimates are used when accounting for amounts
recorded in connection with acquisitions, including initial fair value
determinations of assets and liabilities in a business combination (primarily
IPR&D, other intangible assets and contingent consideration), as well as
subsequent fair value measurements. Additionally, estimates are used in
determining such items as provisions for sales discounts and returns,
depreciable and amortizable lives, recoverability of inventories, including
those produced in preparation for product launches, amounts recorded for
contingencies, environmental liabilities, accruals for contingent sales-based
milestone payments and other reserves, pension and other postretirement
benefit plan assumptions, share-based compensation assumptions, restructuring
costs, impairments of long-lived assets (including intangible assets and
goodwill) and investments, and taxes on income. Because of the uncertainty
inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards -- In August 2020, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amended guidance on the accounting
for convertible instruments and contracts in an entity's own equity. The
guidance removes the separation model for convertible debt instruments and
preferred stock, amends requirements for conversion options to be classified
in equity as well as amends diluted earnings per share (EPS) calculations for
certain convertible debt instruments. The Company adopted the new guidance on
January 1, 2022 using a modified retrospective approach. There was no impact
to the Company's consolidated financial statements upon adoption.

In November 2021, the FASB issued new guidance to increase the transparency of
transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or
contribution accounting model by analogy. The guidance requires annual
disclosures of such transactions to include the nature of the transactions and
the significant terms and conditions, the accounting treatment and the impact
to a company's financial statements. The Company adopted the new guidance on
January 1, 2022 on a prospective basis. There was no material impact to the
Company's consolidated financial statements upon adoption.

In March 2020, the FASB issued optional guidance to ease the potential burden
in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on
financial reporting and subsequently issued clarifying amendments. The
guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for accounting for
contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference the
London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be
discontinued because of reference rate reform. The Company adopted the
optional guidance on July 1, 2022 on a prospective basis. There was no
material impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements upon
adoption.

In October 2021, the FASB issued amended guidance that requires acquiring
entities to recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities in a
business combination in accordance with existing revenue recognition guidance.
The Company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2023. The adoption of
this guidance did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial
statements for prior acquisitions; however, the impact in future periods will
be dependent upon the contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in
future business combinations.

Recently Issued Accounting Standard Not Yet Adopted -- In June 2022, the FASB
issued guidance related to the fair value measurement of an equity security
subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of the equity
security. The new guidance also introduces new disclosure requirements for
equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions that are measured
at fair value. The amended guidance is effective for interim and annual
periods in 2024 and is to be applied prospectively. Early adoption is
permitted for both interim and annual periods. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.

3. Spin-Off of Organon & Co.

On June 2, 2021, Merck completed the spin-off of Organon through a
distribution of Organon's publicly traded stock to Company shareholders. In
connection with the spin-off, each Merck shareholder received one-tenth of a
share of Organon's common stock for each share of Merck common stock held by
such shareholder. The distribution is expected to qualify and has been treated
as tax free to Merck and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. Indebtedness of $9.5 billion principal amount, consisting of term
loans and senior notes, was issued in 2021 in connection with the spin-off and
assumed by Organon. Merck is no longer the obligor of any Organon debt or
financing arrangements. Cash proceeds of $9.0 billion were distributed by
Organon to Merck in connection with the spin-off.

Also in connection with the spin-off, Merck and Organon entered into a
separation and distribution agreement and also entered into various other
agreements to effect the spin-off and provide a framework for the relationship
between Merck and Organon after the spin-off, including a transition services
agreement (TSA), manufacturing and supply agreements (MSAs), trademark license
agreements, intellectual property license agreements, an employee matters
agreement, a tax matters agreement and certain other commercial agreements.
Under the TSA, Merck is providing Organon various services and, similarly,
Organon is providing Merck various services. The provision of services under
the TSA generally will terminate within 25 months following the spin-off;
however, the provision of certain services has been extended to 35 months.
Merck and Organon also entered into a series of interim operating agreements
pursuant to which in various jurisdictions where Merck held licenses, permits
and other rights in connection with marketing, import and/or distribution of
Organon products prior to the separation, Merck is continuing to market,
import and distribute such products until such time as the relevant licenses
and permits are transferred to Organon. Under such interim operating
agreements and in accordance with the separation and distribution agreement,
Merck is continuing operations in the affected markets on behalf of Organon,
with Organon receiving all of the economic benefits and burdens of such
activities. Additionally, Merck and Organon entered into a number of MSAs
pursuant to which Merck is (a) manufacturing and supplying certain active
pharmaceutical ingredients for Organon, (b) manufacturing and supplying
certain formulated pharmaceutical products for Organon, and (c) packaging and
labeling certain finished pharmaceutical products for Organon. Similarly,
Organon and Merck entered into a number of MSAs pursuant to which Organon is
(a) manufacturing and supplying certain formulated pharmaceutical products for
Merck, and (b) packaging and labeling certain finished pharmaceutical products
for Merck. The terms of the MSAs range in initial duration from four years to
ten years.

The amounts included in the consolidated statement of income for the above
MSAs include sales of $383 million and $219 million in 2022 and 2021,
respectively, and related cost of sales of $404 million and $195 million in
2022 and 2021, respectively. Amounts included in the consolidated statement of
income for the TSAs were immaterial in 2022 and 2021. The amounts due from
Organon under all of the above agreements were $511 million and $964 million
at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are reflected in Other
current assets. The amounts due to Organon under these agreements were $345
million and $400 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are
included in Accrued and other current liabilities.

The results of the women's health, biosimilars and established brands
businesses (previously included in the Pharmaceutical segment) that were
contributed to Organon in the spin-off, as well as interest expense related to
the debt issuance in 2021, have been reflected as discontinued operations in
the Company's consolidated statement of income as Income from Discontinued
Operations, Net of Taxes and Amounts Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests
for periods prior to the spin-off on June 2, 2021. Merck incurred separation
costs of $556 million in 2021 and $743 million in 2020 related to the spin-off
of Organon, which are also included in Income from Discontinued Operations,
Net of Taxes and Amounts Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests. These costs
primarily relate to professional fees for separation activities within
finance, tax, legal and information technology functions, as well as
investment banking fees.

4. Acquisitions, Research Collaborations and Licensing Agreements

The Company continues to pursue acquisitions and the establishment of external
alliances such as research collaborations and licensing agreements to
complement its internal research capabilities. These arrangements often
include upfront payments, as well as expense reimbursements or payments to the
third party, and milestone, royalty or profit share arrangements, contingent
upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the
asset in development. The Company also reviews its marketed products and
pipeline to examine candidates which may provide more value through out-
licensing and, as part of its portfolio assessment process, may also divest
certain assets. Pro forma financial information for acquired businesses is not
presented if the historical financial results of the acquired entity are not
significant when compared with the Company's financial results.

Recently Completed Transactions

In February 2023, Merck and Sichuan Kelun-Biotech Biopharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
(Kelun-Biotech) closed a license and collaboration agreement expanding their
relationship in which Merck gained exclusive rights for the research,
development, manufacture and commercialization of up to seven investigational
preclinical antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) for the treatment of cancer.
Kelun-Biotech retained the right to research, develop, manufacture and
commercialize certain licensed and option ADCs for Chinese mainland, Hong Kong
and Macau. Merck will make an upfront payment of $175 million, which will be
recorded in Research and development expenses in 2023. In addition, Kelun-
Biotech is eligible to receive future contingent development-related payments
aggregating up to $1.0 billion, $2.8 billion in regulatory milestones, and
$5.5 billion in sales-based milestones if Kelun-Biotech does not retain
Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Macau rights for the option ADCs and all
candidates achieve regulatory approval. In addition, Kelun-Biotech is eligible
to receive tiered royalties ranging from a mid-single-digit rate to a low-
double-digit rate on future net sales for any commercialized ADC product.
Also, in connection with the agreement, Merck invested $100 million in Kelun-
Biotech's Series B preferred shares in January 2023.

In January 2023, Merck acquired Imago BioSciences, Inc. (Imago), a clinical
stage biopharmaceutical company developing new medicines for the treatment of
myeloproliferative neoplasms and other bone marrow diseases, for $1.35 billion
(including payments to settle share-based equity awards) and also incurred
approximately $60 million of transaction costs. Imago's lead candidate
bomedemstat, MK-3543 (formerly IMG-7289), is an investigational orally
available lysine-specific demethylase 1 inhibitor currently being evaluated in
multiple Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of essential
thrombocythemia, myelofibrosis, and polycythemia vera, in addition to other
indications. The transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of an asset.
Merck will record net assets of approximately $200 million and Research and
development expenses of $1.2 billion in 2023 related to the transaction. There
are no future contingent payments associated with the acquisition.

2022 Transactions

In October 2022, Merck and Royalty Pharma plc (Royalty Pharma) entered into a
funding arrangement under which Royalty Pharma paid Merck $50 million to co-
fund Merck's development costs for a Phase 2b trial of MK-8189, an
investigational oral phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) inhibitor, which is being
evaluated for the treatment of schizophrenia. As Royalty Pharma is sharing the
risk of technical and regulatory success with Merck, the development funding
was recognized by Merck as an obligation to perform contractual services.
Accordingly, the payment received is being recognized by Merck as a reduction
to Research and development expenses ratably over the estimated Phase 2b
research period. Under the agreement, Royalty Pharma has no rights to MK-8189
and has no decision-making authority over the program. If Merck elects to
advance MK-8189 into a Phase 3 study, Royalty Pharma has the option to provide
additional funding of 50% of the development costs up to $375 million. Royalty
Pharma is eligible to receive royalties on future sales. If Royalty Pharma
elects to provide the additional funding noted above, Royalty Pharma becomes
eligible to receive future regulatory milestone payments contingent upon
certain marketing approvals, as well as a higher royalty rate. Merck will
record the milestone payments as an expense within Other (income) expense, net
upon receipt of the related approvals.

In September 2022, Merck exercised its option to jointly develop and
commercialize personalized therapeutic cancer vaccine mRNA-4157/V940 pursuant
to the terms of an existing collaboration and license agreement with Moderna,
Inc. (Moderna), which resulted in a $250 million charge to Research and
development expenses in 2022. mRNA-4157/V940 is currently being evaluated in
combination with Keytruda (pembrolizumab), Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy, as
adjuvant treatment for patients with stage III/IV melanoma following complete
resection in a Phase 2 clinical trial being conducted by Moderna. Merck and
Moderna will collaborate on development and commercialization and will share
costs and any profits equally under this worldwide collaboration.

In August 2022, Merck and Orna Therapeutics (Orna), a biotechnology company
pioneering a new investigational class of engineered circular RNA (oRNA)
therapies, entered into a collaboration agreement to discover, develop, and
commercialize multiple programs, including vaccines and therapeutics in the
areas of infectious disease and oncology. Under the terms of the agreement,
Merck made an upfront payment to Orna of $150 million, which was recorded in
Research and development expenses in 2022. In addition, Orna is eligible to
receive future contingent development-related payments aggregating up to $440
million, $675 million in regulatory milestones, and $2.4 billion in sales-
based milestones associated with the progress of the multiple vaccine and
therapeutic programs, as well as royalties ranging from a high-single-digit
rate to a low-double-digit rate on any approved products derived from the
collaboration. Merck also invested $100 million in Orna's Series B preferred
shares in 2022.

In July 2022, Merck and Orion Corporation (Orion) announced a global co-
development and co-commercialization agreement for Orion's investigational
candidate ODM-208 (MK-5684) and other drugs targeting cytochrome P450 11A1
(CYP11A1), an enzyme important in steroid production. MK-5684 is an oral, non-
steroidal inhibitor of CYP11A1 currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical
trial for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant
prostate cancer. Merck made an upfront payment to Orion of $290 million, which
was recorded in Research and development expenses in 2022. Orion is
responsible for the manufacture of clinical and commercial supply of MK-5684.
In addition, the contract provides both parties with an option to convert the
initial co-development and co-commercialization agreement into a global
exclusive license to Merck. If the option is exercised, Merck would assume
full responsibility for all past development and commercialization expenses
associated with the program since inception of the agreement, as well as all
future development and commercialization expenses. In addition, Orion would be
eligible to receive milestone payments associated with progress in the
development and commercialization of MK-5684, as well as tiered double-digit
royalties on sales if the product is approved.

Also in July 2022, Merck and Kelun-Biotech closed a license and collaboration
agreement in which Merck gained exclusive worldwide rights for the
development, manufacture and commercialization of an investigational ADC
(MK-1200) for the treatment of solid tumors. Under the terms of the agreement,
Merck and Kelun-Biotech will collaborate on the early clinical development of
the investigational ADC. Merck made an upfront payment of $35 million, which
was recorded in Research and development expenses in 2022. Kelun-Biotech is
also eligible to receive future contingent milestone payments aggregating up
to $82 million in developmental milestones, $334 million in regulatory
milestones, and $485 million in sales-based milestones. The agreement also
provides for Merck to pay tiered royalties ranging from a mid-single-digit
rate to a low-double-digit rate on future net sales.

In May 2022, in connection with an existing arrangement, Merck exercised its
option to obtain an exclusive license outside of Chinese mainland, Hong Kong,
Macau and Taiwan for the development, manufacture and commercialization of
Kelun-Biotech's trophoblast antigen 2 (TROP2)-targeting ADC programs,
including its lead compound, SKB-264 (MK-2870), which is currently in Phase 2
clinical development. Under the terms of the agreement, Merck and Kelun-
Biotech will collaborate on certain early clinical development plans,
including evaluating the potential of MK-2870 as a monotherapy and in
combination with Keytruda for advanced solid tumors. Upon option

exercise, Merck made a payment of $30 million, which was recorded in Research
and development expenses in 2022, and agreed to make additional payments of
$30 million upon completion of specified project activities and $25 million
upon technology transfer. Merck also agreed to make quarterly payments in 2022
and 2023 aggregating up to $111 million to fund Kelun-Biotech's ongoing
research and development activities, of which $51 million was paid in 2022. In
addition, Kelun-Biotech is eligible to receive future contingent milestone
payments (which includes all program compounds) aggregating up to $90 million
in developmental milestones, $290 million in first commercial sale milestones,
and $780 million in sales-based milestones. The agreement also provides for
Merck to pay tiered royalties ranging from a mid-single-digit rate to a low-
double-digit rate on future net sales.

2021 Transactions

In November 2021, Merck acquired Acceleron Pharma Inc. (Acceleron), a publicly
traded biopharmaceutical company, for total consideration of $11.5 billion.
Acceleron's development work focused on evaluating the transforming growth
factor (TGF)-beta superfamily of proteins that is known to play a central role
in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation and repair. Acceleron's lead
therapeutic candidate, sotatercept (MK-7962), has a novel mechanism of action
with the potential to improve short-term and/or long-term clinical outcomes in
patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Sotatercept is in Phase 3
trials as an add-on to current standard of care for the treatment of PAH.
Under a previous agreement assumed by Merck, Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) was
granted an exclusive license to develop and commercialize sotatercept outside
of the pulmonary hypertension (PH) field (for which Merck would be eligible to
receive contingent milestones and royalty payments), however, Merck retains
the worldwide exclusive rights to develop and commercialize sotatercept in the
PH field. The agreement provides for Merck to pay 22% royalties on future
sales of sotatercept in the PH field to BMS.

In addition to sotatercept, Acceleron's portfolio includes Reblozyl
(luspatercept), a first-in-class erythroid maturation recombinant fusion
protein that is approved in the U.S., Europe, and certain other markets for
the treatment of anemia in certain rare blood disorders and is also being
evaluated for additional indications for hematology therapies. Reblozyl is
being developed and commercialized through a global collaboration with BMS. In
connection with this ongoing collaboration, Merck receives a 20% sales royalty
from BMS which could increase to a maximum of 24% based on sales levels. This
royalty will be reduced by 50% upon the earlier of patent expiry or generic
entry on an indication-by-indication basis in each market. Additionally, Merck
received a contingent regulatory milestone payment of $20 million in 2022 and
remains eligible to receive up to $80 million in sales-based milestones.

The transaction was accounted for as a business combination. The Company
incurred $280 million of costs directly related to the acquisition of
Acceleron, consisting primarily of share-based compensation payments to settle
non-vested equity awards attributable to postcombination service, severance,
as well as investment banking and legal fees. These costs were included in
Selling, general and administrative expenses and Research and development
costs in 2021.

The estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from
Acceleron (inclusive of measurement period adjustments) is as follows:

| | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | November 19, 2021  
Cash and cash equivalents| | $| 340 |  
Investments| | 285 |  
  
Identifiable intangible assets: (1)

| |  
IPR&D - sotatercept | | 6,380 |  
  
Products and product rights - Reblozyl (12 year useful life)

| | 3,830 |  
Deferred income tax liabilities, net| | (1,814)|  
Other assets and liabilities, net| | 82 |  
Total identifiable net assets| | 9,103 |  
  
Goodwill (2)

| | 2,411 |  
Consideration transferred| | $| 11,514 |  
  
(1) The estimated fair value of the identifiable intangible assets related to
sotatercept and Reblozyl were determined using an income approach,
specifically the multi-period excess earnings method. The future probability-
weighted net cash flows were discounted to present value utilizing a discount
rate of 7.5% for sotatercept and 6.0% for Reblozyl. Actual cash flows are
likely to be different than those assumed.

(2) The goodwill recognized is largely attributable to anticipated synergies
expected to arise after the acquisition and was allocated to the
Pharmaceutical segment. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

In April 2021, Merck acquired Pandion Therapeutics, Inc. (Pandion), a
clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel therapeutics designed to
address the unmet needs of patients living with autoimmune diseases. Pandion's
development work focused on advancing a pipeline of precision immune
modulators targeting

84

Table of Contents

critical immune control nodes. Total consideration paid of $1.9 billion
included $147 million of costs primarily comprised of share-based compensation
payments to settle equity awards. The transaction was accounted for as an
acquisition of an asset. Merck recorded net assets of $156 million (primarily
cash) and Research and development expenses of $1.7 billion in 2021 related to
the transaction. There are no future contingent payments associated with the
acquisition.

In March 2021, Merck and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) entered into an
agreement to jointly develop and commercialize long-acting treatments in HIV
that combine Merck's investigational nucleoside reverse transcriptase
translocation inhibitor, islatravir, and Gilead's investigational capsid
inhibitor, lenacapavir. The collaboration will initially focus on long-acting
oral formulations and long-acting injectable formulations of these combination
products, with other formulations potentially added to the collaboration as
mutually agreed. There was no upfront payment made by either party upon
entering into the agreement.

Under the terms of the agreement, Merck and Gilead will share operational
responsibilities, as well as development, commercialization and marketing
costs, and any future revenues. Global development and commercialization costs
will be shared 60% Gilead and 40% Merck across the oral and injectable
formulation programs. For long-acting oral products, Gilead will lead
commercialization in the U.S. and Merck will lead commercialization in the EU
and the rest of the world. For long-acting injectable products, Merck will
lead commercialization in the U.S. and Gilead will lead commercialization in
the EU and the rest of the world. Gilead and Merck will co-promote in the U.S.
and certain other major markets. Merck and Gilead will share global product
revenues equally until product revenues surpass certain pre-agreed per
formulation revenue tiers. Upon passing $2.0 billion a year in net product
sales for the oral combination, the revenue split will adjust to 65% Gilead
and 35% Merck for any revenues above the threshold. Upon passing $3.5 billion
a year in net product sales for the injectable combination, the revenue split
will adjust to 65% Gilead and 35% Merck for any revenues above the threshold.

Beyond the potential combinations of investigational lenacapavir and
investigational islatravir, Gilead will have the option to license certain of
Merck's investigational oral integrase inhibitors to develop in combination
with lenacapavir. Reciprocally, Merck will have the option to license certain
of Gilead's investigational oral integrase inhibitors to develop in
combination with islatravir. Each company may exercise its option for an
investigational oral integrase inhibitor of the other company following
completion of the first Phase 1 clinical trial of that integrase inhibitor.
Upon exercise of an option, the companies will split development costs and
revenues, unless the non-exercising company decides to opt-out.

In December 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placed full or
partial clinical holds on investigational new drug applications for certain
oral, implant and injectable formulations of islatravir based on observations
of decreases in total lymphocyte and CD4+ T-cell counts in some participants
receiving islatravir in clinical studies. In September 2022, Merck announced
the Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating an investigational oral once-weekly
combination treatment regimen of islatravir and lenacapavir in adults with
HIV-1 infection who are virologically suppressed will resume under an amended
protocol with a lower dose of islatravir. The investigational new drug
application for the islatravir + lenacapavir once-weekly treatment regimen
remains under a partial clinical hold for any studies that would use weekly
oral islatravir doses higher than the doses considered for the revised
clinical program. Additionally, Merck announced it will discontinue the
development of once-monthly oral islatravir for pre-exposure prophylaxis
(PrEP). The Company remains committed to developing compounds for long-acting
HIV prevention and believes in the potential of the nucleoside reverse
transcriptase translocation inhibitor (NRTTI) mechanism.

In January 2021, Merck entered into an exclusive license and research
collaboration agreement with Artiva Biotherapeutics, Inc. (Artiva) to
discover, develop and manufacture CAR-NK cells that target certain solid
tumors using Artiva's proprietary platform. Merck and Artiva agreed to engage
in up to three different research programs, each covering a collaboration
target. Merck has sole responsibility for all development and
commercialization activities (including regulatory filing and approval). Under
the terms of the agreement, Merck made an upfront payment of $30 million,
which was included in Research and development expenses in 2021, for license
and other rights for the first two collaboration targets and agreed to make
another upfront payment of $15 million for license and other rights for the
third collaboration target when it is selected by Merck and accepted by
Artiva. In addition, Artiva is eligible to receive future contingent milestone
payments (which span all three collaboration targets), aggregating up to
$217.5 million in developmental milestones, $570 million in regulatory
milestones, and $1.05 billion in sales-based milestones. The agreement also
provides for Merck to pay tiered royalties ranging from 7% to 14% on future
sales.

2020 Transactions

In December 2020, Merck acquired OncoImmune, a privately held, clinical-stage
biopharmaceutical company, for an upfront payment of $423 million.
OncoImmune's lead therapeutic candidate (MK-7110) was being evaluated for the
treatment of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The transaction was
accounted for as an acquisition of an asset. Under the agreement, prior to the
completion of the acquisition, OncoImmune spun-out certain rights and assets
unrelated to the MK-7110 program to a new entity owned by the existing
shareholders of OncoImmune. In connection with the closing of the acquisition,
Merck invested $50 million for a 20% ownership interest in the new entity,
which was valued at $33 million resulting in a $17 million premium. Merck also
recognized other net liabilities of $22 million. The Company recorded Research
and development expenses of $462 million in 2020 related to this transaction.
In 2021, Merck received feedback from the FDA that additional data would be
needed to support a potential Emergency Use Authorization application and
therefore the Company did not expect MK-7110 would become available until the
first half of 2022. Given this timeline and the technical, clinical and
regulatory uncertainties, the availability of a number of medicines for
patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and the need to concentrate Merck's
resources on accelerating the development and manufacture of the most viable
therapeutics and vaccines, Merck decided to discontinue development of MK-7110
for the treatment of COVID-19. Due to the discontinuation, the Company
recorded charges of $207 million in 2021, which are reflected in Cost of sales
and relate to fixed assets and materials written off, as well as the
recognition of liabilities for purchase commitments.

Also in December 2020, Merck acquired VelosBio Inc. (VelosBio), a privately
held, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, for $2.8 billion. VelosBio's
lead investigational candidate, zilovertamab vedotin (MK-2140), is an ADC
targeting receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) that is
currently being evaluated for the treatment of patients with hematologic
malignancies and solid tumors. The transaction was accounted for as an
acquisition of an asset. Merck recorded net assets of $180 million (primarily
cash) and Research and development expenses of $2.7 billion in 2020 related to
the transaction. During 2021, the Company recorded adjustments to these
amounts which resulted in a reduction of Research and development expenses of
$43 million, an increase to total consideration paid of $47 million, and an
increase to net assets recorded of $90 million.

In September 2020, Merck and Seagen Inc. (Seagen) announced an oncology
collaboration to globally develop and commercialize Seagen's ladiratuzumab
vedotin (MK-6440), an investigational ADC targeting LIV-1, which is currently
in Phase 2 clinical trials. The companies will equally share profits
worldwide. Under the terms of the agreement, Merck made an upfront payment of
$600 million and a $1.0 billion equity investment in 5 million shares of
Seagen common stock at a price of $200 per share. Merck recorded $616 million
in Research and development expenses in 2020 related to this transaction
reflecting the upfront payment as well as a $16 million premium relating to
the equity shares based on the price of Seagen common stock on the closing
date. Seagen is also eligible to receive future contingent milestone payments
of up to $2.6 billion, including $850 million in development milestones and
$1.75 billion in sales-based milestones.

Concurrent with the above transaction, Seagen granted Merck an exclusive
license to commercialize Tukysa (tucatinib), a small molecule tyrosine kinase
inhibitor, for the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2)-positive cancers, in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America and other
regions outside of the U.S., Canada and Europe. Merck will be responsible for
marketing applications seeking approval in its territories. Under the terms of
the agreement, Merck made upfront payments aggregating $210 million, which
were recorded as Research and development expenses in 2020. Seagen is also
eligible to receive future contingent regulatory approval milestones of up to
$65 million and is receiving tiered royalties ranging from 20% to 33% based on
annual sales levels of Tukysa in Merck's territories.

Also in September 2020, Merck acquired a biologics manufacturing facility
located in Dunboyne, Ireland from Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited for
€256 million ($302 million). The transaction was accounted for as an
acquisition of an asset. Merck recorded property, plant and equipment of $289
million and other net assets of $13 million. There are no future contingent
payments associated with the acquisition.

In July 2020, Merck acquired the U.S. rights to Sentinel Flavor Tabs and
Sentinel Spectrum Chews from Virbac Corporation for $410 million. Sentinel
products provide protection against common parasites in dogs. The transaction
was accounted for as an acquisition of an asset. Merck recognized intangible
assets of $401 million related to currently marketed products and inventory of
$9 million at the acquisition date. The estimated fair values of the
identifiable intangible assets related to currently marketed products were
determined using an income approach. Actual cash flows are likely to be
different than those assumed. The intangible assets related to currently
marketed products are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of 15
years. There are no future contingent payments associated with the
acquisition.

Also in July 2020, Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP (Ridgeback), a
closely held biotechnology company, closed a collaboration agreement to
develop Lagevrio (molnupiravir), an investigational oral antiviral COVID-19
medicine. See Note 5 for additional information related to this collaboration.

In June 2020, Merck acquired privately held Themis Bioscience GmbH (Themis), a
company focused on vaccines (including a COVID-19 vaccine candidate, V591) and
immune-modulation therapies for infectious diseases and cancer for $366
million. The acquisition originally provided for Merck to make additional
contingent payments. The transaction was accounted for as a business
combination. The Company determined the fair value of the contingent
consideration was $85 million at the acquisition date utilizing a probability-
weighted estimated cash flow stream using an appropriate discount rate
dependent on the nature and timing of the milestone payments. Merck recognized
intangible assets for IPR&D of $113 million, cash of $59 million, deferred tax
assets of $72 million and other net liabilities of $32 million. The excess of
the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired of
$239 million was recorded as goodwill that was allocated to the Pharmaceutical
segment and is not deductible for tax purposes. The fair values of the
identifiable intangible assets related to IPR&D were determined using an
income approach. In January 2021, the Company announced it was discontinuing
development of V591 as discussed below. As a result, in 2020, the Company
recorded an IPR&D impairment charge of $90 million within Research and
development expenses. The Company also recorded a reduction in Research and
development expenses resulting from a decrease in the related liability for
contingent consideration of $45 million. In 2022, the Company wrote off the
remaining IPR&D intangible asset and related contingent consideration
liability; the net impact to Research and development expenses was immaterial.

In May 2020, Merck and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, Inc. (IAVI),
a nonprofit scientific research organization dedicated to addressing urgent,
unmet global health challenges, announced a collaboration to develop V590, an
investigational vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 being studied for the prevention of
COVID-19. The agreement provided for an upfront payment by Merck of $6.5
million and also provided for future contingent payments based on sales. Merck
also signed an agreement with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development
Authority (BARDA), part of the office of the Assistant Secretary for
Preparedness and Response within an agency of the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services, to provide initial funding support to Merck for this
effort. In January 2021, the Company announced it was discontinuing
development of V590 as discussed below.

In January 2021, the Company announced the discontinuation of the development
programs for its COVID-19 vaccine candidates, V590 and V591, following Merck's
review of findings from Phase 1 clinical studies for the vaccines. In these
studies, both V590 and V591 were generally well tolerated, but the immune
responses were inferior to those seen following natural infection and those
reported for other SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccines. Due to the discontinuation,
the Company recorded a charge of $305 million in 2020, of which $260 million
was reflected in Cost of sales and related to fixed assets and materials
written off, as well as the recognition of liabilities for purchase
commitments. The remaining $45 million of costs were reflected in Research and
development expenses and represent amounts related to the Themis acquisition
noted above (an IPR&D impairment charge, partially offset by a reduction in
the related liability for contingent consideration).

In January 2020, Merck acquired ArQule, Inc. (ArQule), a publicly traded
biopharmaceutical company focused on kinase inhibitor discovery and
development for the treatment of patients with cancer and other diseases.
Total consideration paid of $2.7 billion included $138 million of share-based
compensation payments to settle equity awards attributable to precombination
service and cash paid for transaction costs on behalf of ArQule. The Company
incurred $95 million of costs directly related to the acquisition of ArQule,
consisting almost entirely of share-based compensation payments to settle non-
vested equity awards attributable to postcombination service. These costs were
included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2020. ArQule's
lead investigational candidate, nemtabrutinib (MK-1026), is a novel, oral
Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor currently being evaluated for the
treatment of B-cell malignancies. The transaction was accounted for as a
business combination.

Merck recorded intangible asset impairment charges in 2022 and 2021 related to
nemtabrutinib and in 2022 related to derazantinib (see Note 9).

5. Collaborative Arrangements

Merck has entered into collaborative arrangements that provide the Company
with varying rights to develop, produce and market products together with its
collaborative partners. Both parties in these arrangements are active
participants and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the
commercial success of the activities of the collaboration. Merck's more
significant collaborative arrangements are discussed below.

AstraZeneca

In 2017, Merck and AstraZeneca PLC (AstraZeneca) entered into a global
strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialize
AstraZeneca's Lynparza (olaparib) for multiple cancer types. Independently,
Merck and AstraZeneca will develop and commercialize Lynparza in combinations
with their respective PD-1 and PD-L1 medicines, Keytruda and Imfinzi. The
companies are also jointly developing and commercializing AstraZeneca's
Koselugo (selumetinib) for multiple indications. Under the terms of the
agreement, AstraZeneca and Merck will share the development and
commercialization costs for Lynparza and Koselugo monotherapy and non-
PD-L1/PD-1 combination therapy opportunities.

Profits from Lynparza and Koselugo product sales generated through
monotherapies or combination therapies are shared equally. AstraZeneca is the
principal on Lynparza and Koselugo sales transactions. Merck records its share
of Lynparza and Koselugo product sales, net of cost of sales and
commercialization costs, as alliance revenue, and its share of development
costs associated with the collaboration as part of Research and development
expenses. Reimbursements received from AstraZeneca for research and
development expenses are recognized as reductions to Research and development
costs.

As part of the agreement, Merck made an upfront payment to AstraZeneca and
also made payments over a multi-year period for certain license options. In
addition, the agreement provides for contingent payments from Merck to
AstraZeneca related to the successful achievement of sales-based and
regulatory milestones.

In 2022, Merck determined it was probable that sales of Lynparza in the future
would trigger a $600 million sales-based milestone payment from Merck to
AstraZeneca. Accordingly, Merck recorded a $600 million liability (which
remained accrued at December 31, 2022) and a corresponding increase to the
intangible asset related to Lynparza. Merck also recognized $250 million of
cumulative amortization catch-up expense related to the recognition of this
milestone in 2022. Merck made sales-based milestone payments to AstraZeneca
aggregating $400 million and $550 million in 2022 and 2020, respectively.
Potential future sales-based milestone payments of $2.1 billion have not yet
been accrued as they are not deemed by the Company to be probable at this
time.

In 2022 and 2020, Lynparza received regulatory approvals triggering
capitalized milestone payments of $250 million and $160 million, respectively,
from Merck to AstraZeneca. A regulatory milestone of $105 million that was
accrued at December 31, 2022 was paid in January 2023. Potential future
regulatory milestone payments of $1.1 billion remain under the agreement.

The intangible asset balance related to Lynparza (which includes capitalized
sales-based and regulatory milestone payments) was $1.6 billion at December
31, 2022 and is included in Other Intangibles, Net. The amount is

Eisai

In 2018, Merck and Eisai Co., Ltd. (Eisai) announced a strategic collaboration
for the worldwide co-development and co-commercialization of Lenvima
(lenvatinib), an orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor discovered by
Eisai. Under the agreement, Merck and Eisai will develop and commercialize
Lenvima jointly, both as monotherapy and in combination with Keytruda. Eisai
records Lenvima product sales globally (Eisai is the principal on Lenvima
sales transactions) and Merck and Eisai share applicable profits equally.
Merck records its share of Lenvima product sales, net of cost of sales and
commercialization costs, as alliance revenue. Expenses incurred during co-
development are shared by the two companies in accordance with the
collaboration agreement and reflected in Research and development expenses.
Certain expenses incurred solely by Merck or Eisai are not shareable under the
collaboration agreement, including costs incurred in excess of agreed upon
caps and costs related to certain combination studies of Keytruda and Lenvima.

Under the agreement, Merck made an upfront payment to Eisai and also made
payments over a multi-year period for certain option rights (of which the
final $125 million option payment was made in March 2021). In addition, the
agreement provides for contingent payments from Merck to Eisai related to the
successful achievement of sales-based and regulatory milestones.

Merck made sales-based milestone payments to Eisai aggregating $600 million,
$200 million and $500 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Potential
future sales-based milestone payments of $2.6 billion have not yet been
accrued as they are not deemed by the Company to be probable at this time.

In 2022, 2021 and 2020, Lenvima received regulatory approvals triggering
capitalized milestone payments of $50 million, $75 million and $10 million,
respectively, from Merck to Eisai. There are no regulatory milestone payments
remaining under the agreement.

The intangible asset balance related to Lenvima (which includes capitalized
sales-based and regulatory milestone payments) was $814 million at December
31, 2022 and is included in Other Intangibles, Net. The amount is being
amortized over its estimated useful life through 2026 as supported by
projected future cash flows, subject to impairment testing.

Bayer AG

In 2014, the Company entered into a worldwide clinical development
collaboration with Bayer AG (Bayer) to market and develop soluble guanylate
cyclase (sGC) modulators including Bayer's Adempas (riociguat). The two
companies have implemented a joint development and commercialization strategy.
The collaboration also includes development of Bayer's Verquvo (vericiguat),
which was approved in the U.S., the EU and Japan in 2021 and has since been
approved in several other markets. Under the agreement, Bayer commercializes
Adempas in the Americas, while Merck commercializes in the rest of the world.
For Verquvo, Merck commercializes in the U.S. and Bayer commercializes in the
rest of the world. Both companies share in development costs and profits on
sales. Merck records sales of Adempas and Verquvo in its marketing
territories, as well as alliance revenue. Alliance revenue represents Merck's
share of profits from sales of Adempas and Verquvo in Bayer's marketing
territories, which are product sales net of cost of sales and
commercialization costs. Cost of sales includes Bayer's share of profits from
sales in Merck's marketing territories.

In addition, the agreement provided for contingent payments from Merck to
Bayer related to the successful achievement of sales-based milestones. Merck
made sales-based milestone payments to Bayer of $400 million and $375 million
in 2022 and 2020, respectively. There are no sales-based milestone payments
remaining under the agreement.

The intangible asset balances related to Adempas (which includes the acquired
intangible asset balance, as well as capitalized sales-based milestone
payments attributed to Adempas) and Verquvo (which reflects the portion of the
final sales-based milestone payment that was attributed to Verquvo) were $633
million and $57 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022 and are included
in Other Intangibles, Net. The assets are being amortized over their estimated
useful lives (through 2027 for Adempas and through 2031 for Verquvo) as
supported by projected future cash flows, subject to impairment testing.

Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP

In July 2020, Merck and Ridgeback, a closely held biotechnology company,
entered into a collaboration agreement to develop Lagevrio, an investigational
orally available antiviral candidate for the treatment of patients with
COVID-19. Merck gained exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize
Lagevrio and related molecules. Following initial authorizations in certain
markets in the fourth quarter of 2021, Lagevrio has since received multiple
additional authorizations worldwide.

Under the terms of the agreement, Ridgeback received an upfront payment and is
eligible to receive future contingent payments dependent upon the achievement
of certain developmental and regulatory approval milestones. The agreement
also provides for Merck to reimburse Ridgeback for a portion of certain third-
party contingent milestone payments and royalties on net sales, which is part
of the profit-sharing calculation. Merck is the principal on sales
transactions, recognizing sales and related costs, with profit-sharing amounts
recorded within Cost of sales. Profits from the collaboration are split
equally between the partners. Reimbursements from Ridgeback for its share of
research and development costs (deducted from Ridgeback's share of profits)
are reflected as decreases to Research and development expenses.

Summarized financial information related to this collaboration is as follows:

Bristol Myers Squibb

Reblozyl (luspatercept-aamt) is a first-in-class erythroid maturation
recombinant fusion protein obtained as part of Merck's November 2021
acquisition of Acceleron that is being developed and commercialized through a
global collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS). Reblozyl is approved in
the U.S., Europe, and certain other markets for the treatment of anemia in
certain rare blood disorders and is also being evaluated for additional
indications for hematology therapies. BMS is the principal on sales
transactions for Reblozyl; however, Merck co-promotes Reblozyl (and will co-
promote all future products approved under this collaboration) in North
America, which is reimbursed by BMS. Merck receives a 20% sales royalty from
BMS which could increase to a maximum of 24% based on sales levels. This
royalty will be reduced by 50% upon the earlier of patent expiry or generic
entry on an indication-by-indication basis in each market. Additionally, Merck
is eligible to receive future contingent sales-based milestone payments of up
to $80 million. Merck recorded alliance revenue of $166 million in 2022, which
includes royalties of $146 million and the receipt of a regulatory approval
milestone payment of $20 million, compared with alliance revenue of $17
million in 2021.

6. Restructuring

In 2019, Merck approved a global restructuring program (Restructuring Program)
as part of a worldwide initiative focused on further optimizing the Company's
manufacturing and supply network, as well as reducing its global real estate
footprint. This program is a continuation of the Company's plant
rationalization and builds on prior restructuring programs. The actions
currently contemplated under the Restructuring Program are expected to be
substantially completed by the end of 2023, with the cumulative pretax costs
to be incurred by the Company to implement the program estimated to be
approximately $3.7 billion. The Company estimates that approximately 70% of
the cumulative pretax costs will result in cash outlays, primarily related to
employee separation expense and facility shut-down costs. Approximately 30% of
the cumulative pretax costs will be non-cash, relating primarily to the
accelerated depreciation of facilities to be closed or divested.

91

* * *

Table of Contents

The Company recorded total pretax costs of $666 million in 2022, $868 million
in 2021 and $880 million in 2020 related to restructuring program activities.
Since inception of the Restructuring Program through December 31, 2022, Merck
has recorded total pretax accumulated costs of approximately $3.3 billion. The
Company expects to record charges of approximately $400 million in 2023
related to the Restructuring Program. For segment reporting, restructuring
charges are unallocated expenses.

The following table summarizes the charges related to restructuring program
activities by type of cost:

| $| 385 | | | $| 268 | | | $| 227 | | | $| 880 |  
  
Separation costs are associated with actual headcount reductions, as well as
involuntary headcount reductions which were probable and could be reasonably
estimated.

Accelerated depreciation costs primarily relate to manufacturing, research and
administrative facilities and equipment to be sold or closed as part of the
program. Accelerated depreciation costs represent the difference between the
depreciation expense to be recognized over the revised useful life of the
asset, based upon the anticipated date the site will be closed or divested or
the equipment disposed of, and depreciation expense as determined utilizing
the useful life prior to the restructuring actions. All the sites have and
will continue to operate up through the respective closure dates and, since
future undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to recover the respective book
values, Merck is recording accelerated depreciation over the revised useful
life of the site assets. Anticipated site closure dates, particularly related
to manufacturing locations, have been and may continue to be adjusted to
reflect changes resulting from regulatory or other factors.

Other activity in 2022, 2021 and 2020 includes asset abandonment, facility
shut-down and other related costs, as well as pretax gains and losses
resulting from the sales of facilities and related assets. Additionally, other
activity includes certain employee-related costs associated with pension and
other postretirement benefit plans (see Note 14) and share-based compensation.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Company manages the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest
rate movements on its earnings, cash flows and fair values of assets and
liabilities through operational means and through the use of various financial
instruments, including derivative instruments.

A significant portion of the Company's revenues and earnings in foreign
affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. The objectives of
and accounting related to the Company's foreign currency risk management
program, as well as its interest rate risk management activities are discussed
below.

  

Foreign Currency Risk Management

The Company has established revenue hedging, balance sheet risk management and
net investment hedging programs to protect against volatility of future
foreign currency cash flows and changes in fair value caused by changes in
foreign exchange rates.

The objective of the revenue hedging program is to reduce the variability
caused by changes in foreign exchange rates that would affect the U.S. dollar
value of future cash flows derived from foreign currency denominated sales,
primarily the euro, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi. To achieve this
objective, the Company will hedge a portion of its forecasted foreign currency
denominated third-party and intercompany distributor entity sales (forecasted
sales) that are expected to occur over its planning cycle, typically no more
than two years into the future. The Company will layer in hedges over time,
increasing the portion of forecasted sales hedged as it gets closer to the
expected date of the forecasted sales. The portion of forecasted sales hedged
is based on assessments of cost-benefit profiles that consider natural
offsetting exposures, revenue and exchange rate volatilities and correlations,
and the cost of hedging instruments. The Company manages its anticipated
transaction exposure principally with purchased local currency put options,
forward contracts, and purchased collar options.

The fair values of these derivative contracts are recorded as either assets
(gain positions) or liabilities (loss positions) in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet. Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts are recorded each
period in either current earnings or OCI depending on whether the derivative
is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge
transaction. For derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges, the
unrealized gains or losses on these contracts are recorded in AOCL and
reclassified into Sales when the hedged anticipated revenue is recognized. For
those derivatives which are not designated as cash flow hedges, but serve as
economic hedges of forecasted sales, unrealized gains or losses are recorded
in Sales each period. The cash flows from both designated and non-designated
contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement
of Cash Flows. The Company does not enter into derivatives for trading or
speculative purposes.

The Company manages operating activities and net asset positions at each local
subsidiary in order to mitigate the effects of exchange on monetary assets and
liabilities. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other
than the functional currency of a given subsidiary are remeasured at spot
rates in effect on the balance sheet date with the effects of changes in spot
rates reported in Other (income) expense, net. The Company also uses a balance
sheet risk management program to mitigate the exposure of such assets and
liabilities from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange. Merck
principally utilizes forward exchange contracts to offset the effects of
exchange in developed country currencies, primarily the euro, Japanese yen,
British pound, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and Swiss franc. For
exposures in developing country currencies, including the Chinese renminbi,

the Company will enter into forward contracts to offset the effects of
exchange on exposures when it is deemed economical to do so based on a cost-
benefit analysis that considers the magnitude of the exposure, the volatility
of the exchange rate and the cost of the hedging instrument. The forward
contracts are not designated as hedges and are marked to market through Other
(income) expense, net. Accordingly, fair value changes in the forward
contracts help mitigate the changes in the value of the remeasured assets and
liabilities attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, except
to the extent of the spot-forward differences. These differences are not
significant due to the short-term nature of the contracts, which typically
have average maturities at inception of less than six months. The cash flows
from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows.

The Company also uses forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of its net
investment in foreign operations against movements in exchange rates. The
forward contracts are designated as hedges of the net investment in a foreign
operation. The unrealized gains or losses on these contracts are recorded in
foreign currency translation adjustment within OCI, and remain in AOCL until
either the sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the
subsidiary. The Company excludes certain portions of the change in fair value
of its derivative instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness
(excluded components). Changes in fair value of the excluded components are
recognized in OCI. The Company recognizes in earnings the initial value of the
excluded components on a straight-line basis over the life of the derivative
instrument, rather than using the mark-to-market approach. The cash flows from
these contracts are reported as investing activities in the Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows.

Foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency
debt. The Company's senior unsecured euro-denominated notes have been
designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of the net investment in
a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses
due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments are
included in foreign currency translation adjustment within OCI.

The effects of the Company's net investment hedges on OCI and the Consolidated
Statement of Income are shown below:

Interest Rate Risk Management

The Company may use interest rate swap contracts on certain investing and
borrowing transactions to manage its net exposure to interest rate changes and
to reduce its overall cost of borrowing. The Company does not use leveraged
swaps and, in general, does not leverage any of its investment activities that
would put principal at risk.

In 2022, nine interest rate swap contracts with a total notional amount of
$2.25 billion matured. These swaps effectively converted the Company's $1.0
billion, 2.4% fixed-rate notes and $1.25 billion, 2.35% fixed-rate notes due
2022 to variable rate debt.

The interest rate swap contracts were designated hedges of the fair value
changes in the notes attributable to changes in the benchmark LIBOR swap rate.
The fair value changes in the notes attributable to changes in the LIBOR swap
rate were recorded in interest expense along with the offsetting fair value
changes in the swap contracts. The cash flows from these contracts are
reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
The Company is not currently a party to any interest rate swaps.

Fair Value Measurements

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an
asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most
advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants on the measurement date. The Company uses a fair
value hierarchy which maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the
use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels
of inputs used to measure fair value with Level 1 having the highest priority
and Level 3 having the lowest:

Level 1 -- Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities.

Level 2 -- Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices
for similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can
be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of
the assets or liabilities.

Level 3 -- Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market
activity. Level 3 assets or liabilities are those whose values are determined
using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar
techniques with significant unobservable inputs, as well as assets or
liabilities for which the determination of fair value requires significant
judgment or estimation.

If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within
more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest
level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the
instrument.

(2) At December 31, 2022 and 2021, $368 million and $620 million,
respectively, of the liabilities relate to the termination of the Sanofi
Pasteur MSD joint venture in 2016. As part of the termination, Merck recorded
a liability for contingent future royalty payments of 11.5% on net sales of
all Merck products that were previously sold by the joint venture through
December 31, 2024. The fair value of this liability is determined utilizing
the estimated amount and timing of projected cash flows using a risk-adjusted
discount rate to present value the cash flows. Balance at December 31, 2022
includes $122 million recorded as a current liability for amounts expected to
be paid within the next 12 months.

The payments of contingent consideration in both years relate to the Sanofi
Pasteur MSD liabilities described above.

Some of the Company's financial instruments, such as cash and cash
equivalents, receivables and payables, are reflected in the balance sheet at
carrying value, which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature.

The estimated fair value of loans payable and long-term debt (including
current portion) at December 31, 2022, was $26.7 billion compared with a
carrying value of $30.7 billion and at December 31, 2021, was $35.7 billion
compared with a carrying value of $33.1 billion. Fair value was estimated
using recent observable market prices and would be considered Level 2 in the
fair value hierarchy.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors concentrations of credit risk
associated with corporate and government issuers of securities and financial
institutions with which it conducts business. Credit exposure limits are
established to limit a concentration with any single issuer or institution.
Cash and investments are placed in instruments that meet high credit quality
standards, as specified in the Company's investment policy guidelines.

The majority of the Company's accounts receivable arise from product sales in
the U.S., Europe and China and are primarily due from drug wholesalers and
retailers, hospitals and government agencies. The Company monitors the
financial performance and creditworthiness of its customers so that it can
properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile. The Company
also continues to monitor global economic conditions, including the volatility
associated with international sovereign economies, and associated impacts on
the financial markets and its business.

The Company's customers with the largest accounts receivable balances are:
McKesson Corporation, AmerisourceBergen Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc.,
which represented approximately 21%, 20% and 13%, respectively, of total
accounts receivable at December 31, 2022. The Company monitors the
creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the
normal course of business. Bad debts have been minimal. The Company does not
normally require collateral or other security to support credit sales.

The Company has accounts receivable factoring agreements with financial
institutions in certain countries to sell accounts receivable. The Company
factored $2.5 billion and $2.8 billion of accounts receivable as of December
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, under these factoring arrangements, which
reduced outstanding accounts receivable. The cash received from the financial
institutions is reported within operating activities in the Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows. In certain of these factoring arrangements, for ease
of administration, the Company will collect customer payments related to the
factored receivables, which it then remits to the financial institutions. At
December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had collected $67 million and $62
million, respectively, on behalf of the financial institutions, which is
reflected as restricted cash in Other current assets and the related
obligation to remit the cash within Accrued and other current liabilities. The
Company remitted the cash to the financial institutions in January 2023 and
2022, respectively. The net cash flows related to these collections are
reported as financing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
The cost of factoring such accounts receivable was de minimis.

Derivative financial instruments are executed under International Swaps and
Derivatives Association master agreements. The master agreements with several
of the Company's financial institution counterparties also include credit
support annexes. These annexes contain provisions that require collateral to
be exchanged depending on the value of the derivative assets and liabilities,
the Company's credit rating, and the credit rating of the counterparty. Cash
collateral advanced by the Company to various counterparties was $19 million
at December 31, 2022. Cash collateral received by the Company from various
counterparties was $66 million and $164 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. The obligation to return such collateral is recorded in Accrued
and other current liabilities.

Some of the more significant acquired intangibles included in products and
product rights, on a net basis, related to human health marketed products at
December 31, 2022 were Reblozyl, $3.5 billion; Zerbaxa, $406 million;
Sivextro, $122 million; Gardasil/Gardasil 9, $120 million; and Bridion, $97
million. Additionally, the Company had $4.6 billion of net acquired
intangibles related to animal health at December 31, 2022, of which $2.3
billion related to products and product rights and $2.2 billion was
attributable to trade names, primarily related to Allflex. At December 31,
2022, IPR&D primarily relates to MK-7962 (sotatercept), $6.4 billion, obtained
through the acquisition of Acceleron in 2021 (see Note 4); MK-7264
(gefapixant), $832 million, obtained through the acquisition of Afferent
Pharmaceuticals in 2016; and MK-1026 (nemtabrutinib), $418 million, obtained
through the acquisition of ArQule in

2020 (see below and Note 4). Some of the more significant net intangible
assets included in licenses and other above at December 31, 2022 include
Lynparza, $1.6 billion, related to a collaboration with AstraZeneca; Lenvima,
$814 million, related to a collaboration with Eisai; and Adempas, $633
million, related to a collaboration with Bayer. See Note 5 for additional
information related to the intangible assets associated with these
collaborations.

In 2020, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.6 billion within Cost
of sales related to Zerbaxa (ceftolozane and tazobactam) for injection, a
combination antibacterial and beta-lactamase inhibitor for the treatment of
certain bacterial infections. In December 2020, the Company temporarily
suspended sales of Zerbaxa, and subsequently issued a product recall,
following the identification of product sterility issues. The recall
constituted a triggering event requiring the evaluation of the Zerbaxa
intangible asset for impairment. The Company revised its cash flow forecasts
for Zerbaxa utilizing certain assumptions around the return to market timeline
and anticipated uptake in sales thereafter. These revised cash flow forecasts
indicated that the Zerbaxa intangible asset value was not fully recoverable on
an undiscounted cash flows basis. The Company utilized market participant
assumptions to determine its best estimate of the fair value of the intangible
asset related to Zerbaxa that, when compared with its related carrying value,
resulted in the impairment charge noted above. The Company also wrote-off
inventory of $120 million to Cost of sales in 2020 related to the Zerbaxa
recall. A phased resupply of Zerbaxa was initiated in the fourth quarter of
2021 and completed during 2022.

IPR&D that the Company acquires through business combinations represents the
fair value assigned to incomplete research projects which, at the time of
acquisition, have not reached technological feasibility. Amounts capitalized
as IPR&D are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to
impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects. Upon
successful completion of each IPR&D project, the Company will make a separate
determination as to the then-useful life of the asset and begin amortization.

In 2022, the Company recorded $1.7 billion of intangible impairment charges
within Research and development expenses, of which $1.6 billion represents
IPR&D impairment charges related to nemtabrutinib (MK-1026), a novel, oral BTK
inhibitor currently being evaluated for the treatment of B-cell malignancies
that was obtained through the 2020 acquisition of ArQule (see Note 4).
Following discussions with regulatory authorities in the third quarter, the
development period for nemtabrutinib was extended, which constituted a
triggering event that required the evaluation of the nemtabrutinib intangible
asset for impairment. The Company estimated the current fair value of
nemtabrutinib utilizing an income approach which calculates the present value
of projected future cash flows. The market participant assumptions used to
derive the forecasted cash flows were updated to reflect a delay in the
anticipated launch date for nemtabrutinib, which resulted in lower cumulative
revenue forecasts and a reduction in the estimated fair value. The revised
estimated fair value of nemtabrutinib when compared with its related carrying
value resulted in a $807 million impairment charge recorded in the third
quarter of 2022. In December 2022, regulatory authorities provided additional
feedback with respect to clinical study design that led to a further
reassessment of the development plan for nemtabrutinib, which is expected to
result in changes to the clinical study design, and corresponding delays in
the anticipated approval and launch timelines, which constituted a triggering
event. Utilizing an income approach, the forecasted cash flows were updated to
reflect a decline in forecasted revenue coupled with an increase in
development cost forecasts, which reduced projected cash flows lowering the
estimated current fair value of nemtabrutinib. The revised estimated fair
value of nemtabrutinib when compared with its then-related carrying value
resulted in a $780 million impairment charge. The remaining IPR&D intangible
asset related to nemtabrutinib is $418 million. If the assumptions used to
estimate the fair value of nemtabrutinib prove to be incorrect and the
development of nemtabrutinib does not progress as anticipated thereby
adversely affecting projected future cash flows, the Company may record an
additional impairment charge in the future and such charge could be material.
The Company also recorded an $80 million intangible asset impairment charge
related to derazantinib resulting from the termination of the out-licensing
agreement and the decision by Merck not to pursue development of derazantinib.

In 2021, the Company recorded a $275 million IPR&D impairment charge related
to nemtabrutinib. As part of Merck's annual impairment assessment of IPR&D
intangible assets, the Company estimated the current fair value of
nemtabrutinib utilizing projected future cash flows. The market participant
assumptions used to derive the forecasted cash flows were updated to reflect
the current competitive landscape for nemtabrutinib, including increased
expected development costs for additional clinical trial data needed to
develop nemtabrutinib, as well as a delay in the anticipated launch date for
nemtabrutinib, which collectively reduced the projected future cash flows and
estimated fair value. Additionally, the discount rate utilized to determine
the current fair value of the asset was reduced to 8.5% to reflect the current
risk profile of the asset. The revised estimated fair value of nemtabrutinib
when compared with its related carrying value resulted in the IPR&D impairment
charge noted above.

In 2020, the Company recorded a $90 million IPR&D impairment charge related to
a decision to discontinue the development program for COVID-19 vaccine
candidate V591 following Merck's review of findings from a Phase 1 clinical
study for the vaccine. In the study, V591 was generally well tolerated, but
the immune responses were inferior to those seen following natural infection
and those reported for other SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccines. The discontinuation
of this development program also resulted in a reversal of the related
liability for contingent consideration of $45 million.

The IPR&D projects that remain in development are subject to the inherent
risks and uncertainties in drug development and it is possible that the
Company will not be able to successfully develop and complete the IPR&D
programs and profitably commercialize the underlying product candidates.

The Company may recognize additional non-cash impairment charges in the future
related to other marketed products or pipeline programs and such charges could
be material.

Aggregate amortization expense primarily recorded within Cost of sales was
$2.1 billion in 2022, $1.6 billion in 2021 and $1.8 billion in 2020. The
estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of the next five years is as
follows: 2023, $1.8 billion; 2024, $1.7 billion; 2025, $1.6 billion; 2026,
$1.5 billion; 2027, $1.3 billion.

respectively.

With the exception of the 6.30% debentures due 2026, the notes listed in the
table above are redeemable in whole or in part, at Merck's option at any time,
at varying redemption prices. Effective as of November 3, 2009, the Company
executed a full and unconditional guarantee of the then existing debt of its
subsidiary Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. (MSD) and MSD executed a full and
unconditional guarantee of the then existing debt of the Company (excluding
commercial paper), including for payments of principal and interest. These
guarantees do not extend to debt issued subsequent to that date.

Certain of the Company's borrowings require that Merck comply with covenants
and, at December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.

The aggregate maturities of long-term debt for each of the next five years are
as follows: 2023, $1.7 billion; 2024, $1.3 billion; 2025, $2.5 billion; 2026,
$2.2 billion; 2027, $1.5 billion. Interest payments related to these debt
obligations are as follows: 2023, $882 million; 2024, $845 million; 2025, $778
million; 2026, $751 million; 2027, $720 million.

The Company has a $6.0 billion credit facility that matures in June 2026. The
facility provides backup liquidity for the Company's commercial paper
borrowing facility and is to be used for general corporate purposes. The
Company has not drawn funding from this facility.

Leases

The Company has operating leases primarily for manufacturing facilities,
research and development facilities, corporate offices, employee housing,
vehicles and certain equipment. The Company determines if an arrangement is a
lease at inception. When evaluating contracts for embedded leases, the Company
exercises judgment to determine if there is an explicit or implicit identified
asset in the contract and if Merck controls the use of that asset. Embedded
leases, primarily associated with contract manufacturing organizations, are
immaterial. The lease term includes options to extend or terminate the lease
when it is reasonably certain that Merck will exercise that option. Real
estate leases for facilities have an average remaining lease term of seven
years, which include options to extend the leases for up to four years where
applicable. Vehicle leases are generally in effect for four years. The Company
elected to exclude short-term leases (leases with an initial term of 12 months
or less) from the lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.

Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the term of the lease. Operating lease assets and liabilities are
recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.
Since the Company's leases do not have a readily determinable implicit
discount rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to calculate
the present value of lease payments by asset class. On a quarterly basis, an
updated incremental borrowing rate is determined based on the average
remaining lease term of each asset class and the Company's pretax cost of debt
for that same term. The updated rates for each asset class are applied
prospectively to new leases. The Company does not separate lease components
(e.g. payments for rent, real estate taxes and insurance costs) from non-lease
components (e.g. common-area maintenance costs) in the event that the
agreement contains both. Merck includes both the lease and non-lease
components for purposes of calculating the right-of-use asset and related
lease liability (if the non-lease components are fixed). For vehicle leases
and employee housing, the Company applies a portfolio approach to account for
the operating lease assets and liabilities.

Certain of the Company's lease agreements contain variable lease payments that
are adjusted periodically for inflation or for actual operating expense true-
ups compared with estimated amounts; however, these amounts are immaterial.
Sublease income and activity related to sale and leaseback transactions are
immaterial. Merck's lease agreements do not contain any material residual
value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

Operating lease cost was $334 million in 2022, $343 million in 2021 and $340
million in 2020. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of
operating lease liabilities was $335 million in 2022, $340 million in 2021 and
$334 million in 2020. Operating lease assets obtained in exchange for lease
obligations were $57 million in 2022, $117 million in 2021 and $473 million in
2020.

11. Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities 

The Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature
considered normal to its business, including product liability, intellectual
property, and commercial litigation, as well as certain additional matters
including governmental and environmental matters. In the opinion of the
Company, it is unlikely that the resolution of these matters will be material
to the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Given the nature of the litigation discussed below and the complexities
involved in these matters, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate a
possible loss or range of possible loss for such matters until the Company
knows, among other factors, (i) what claims, if any, will survive dispositive
motion practice, (ii) the extent of the claims, including the size of any
potential class, particularly when damages are not specified or are
indeterminate, (iii) how the discovery process will affect the litigation,
(iv) the settlement posture of the other parties to the litigation and (v) any
other factors that may have a material effect on the litigation.

The Company records accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a
liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These
accruals are adjusted periodically as assessments change or additional
information becomes available. For product liability claims, a portion of the
overall accrual is actuarially determined and considers such factors as past
experience, number of claims reported and estimates of claims incurred but not
yet reported. Individually significant contingent losses are accrued when
probable and reasonably estimable. Legal defense costs expected to be incurred
in connection with a loss contingency are accrued when probable and reasonably
estimable.

The Company's decision to obtain insurance coverage is dependent on market
conditions, including cost and availability, existing at the time such
decisions are made. The Company has evaluated its risks and has determined
that the cost of obtaining product liability insurance outweighs the likely
benefits of the coverage that is available and, as such, has no insurance for
most product liabilities.

Product Liability Litigation

Gardasil/Gardasil 9

As previously disclosed, Merck is a defendant in product liability lawsuits in
the U.S. involving Gardasil (Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent [Types 6, 11,
16 and 18] Vaccine, Recombinant) and Gardasil 9 (Human Papillomavirus 9-valent
Vaccine, Recombinant). As of December 31, 2022, approximately 70 cases were
filed and pending against Merck in either federal or state court. In these
actions, plaintiffs allege, among other things, that they suffered various
personal injuries after vaccination with Gardasil or Gardasil 9, with postural
orthostatic tachycardia syndrome as a predominate alleged injury. In August
2022, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered that
Gardasil/Gardasil 9 product liability cases pending in federal courts
nationwide be transferred to Judge Robert J. Conrad in the Western District of
North Carolina for coordinated pre-trial proceedings. There are fewer than 15
product liability cases pending outside the U.S., including one purported
class action in Colombia.

Governmental Proceedings

As previously disclosed, in the fall of 2018, the Company received a records
subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Vermont (VT USAO)
pursuant to Section 248 of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act of 1996 (HIPAA) relating to an investigation of potential health care
offenses. The subpoena

Table of Contents

sought information relating to any actual or potential business relationship
or arrangement Merck has had with Practice Fusion, Inc. (PFI), a cloud-based,
electronic health records (EHR) company that was acquired by Allscripts in
January 2018. The Company cooperated with the government and responded to that
subpoena. Subsequently, in May 2019, Merck received a second records subpoena
from the VT USAO that broadened the government's information request by
seeking information relating to Merck's relationship with any EHR company.
Shortly thereafter, the VT USAO served a Civil Investigation Demand (CID) upon
Merck similarly seeking information on the Company's relationships with EHR
vendors. The CID explains that the government is conducting a False Claims Act
investigation concerning whether Merck and/or PFI submitted claims to federal
health care programs that violate the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Merck is
cooperating with the government's investigation.

As previously disclosed, in April 2019, Merck received a set of investigative
interrogatories from the California Attorney General's Office pursuant to its
investigation of conduct and agreements that allegedly affected or delayed
competition to Lantus in the insulin market. The interrogatories seek
information concerning Merck's development of an insulin glargine product, and
its subsequent termination, as well as Merck's patent litigation against
Sanofi S.A. concerning Lantus and the resolution of that litigation. Merck is
cooperating with the California Attorney General's investigation.

As previously disclosed, in June 2020, Merck received a CID from the U.S.
Department of Justice. The CID requests answers to interrogatories, as well as
various documents, regarding temperature excursions at a third-party storage
facility containing certain Merck products. Merck is cooperating with the
government's investigation and intends to produce information and/or documents
as necessary in response to the CID.

As previously disclosed, from time to time, the Company's subsidiaries in
China receive inquiries regarding their operations from various Chinese
governmental agencies. Some of these inquiries may be related to matters
involving other multinational pharmaceutical companies, as well as Chinese
entities doing business with such companies. The Company's policy is to
cooperate with these authorities and to provide responses as appropriate.

As previously disclosed, from time to time, the Company receives inquiries and
is the subject of preliminary investigation activities from competition and
other governmental authorities in markets outside the U.S. These authorities
may include regulators, administrative authorities, and law enforcement and
other similar officials, and these preliminary investigation activities may
include site visits, formal or informal requests or demands for documents or
materials, inquiries or interviews and similar matters. Certain of these
preliminary inquiries or activities may lead to the commencement of formal
proceedings. Should those proceedings be determined adversely to the Company,
monetary fines and/or remedial undertakings may be required.

Commercial and Other Litigation

Zetia Antitrust Litigation

As previously disclosed, Merck, MSD, Schering Corporation, Schering-Plough
Corporation, and MSP Singapore Company LLC (collectively, the Merck
Defendants) are defendants in a number of lawsuits filed in 2018 on behalf of
direct and indirect purchasers of Zetia (ezetimibe) alleging violations of
federal and state antitrust laws, as well as other state statutory and common
law causes of action. The cases were consolidated in a federal multidistrict
litigation (the Zetia MDL) before Judge Rebecca Beach Smith in the Eastern
District of Virginia.

In November 2019, the direct purchaser plaintiffs and the indirect purchaser
plaintiffs filed motions for class certification. In August 2020, the district
court granted in part the direct purchasers' motion for class certification
and certified a class of 35 direct purchasers. In August 2021, the Fourth
Circuit vacated the district court's class certification order and remanded
for further proceedings consistent with the court's ruling. In September 2021,
the direct purchaser plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for class
certification. On January 25, 2022, the magistrate judge recommended that the
district court deny the motion for class certification. On February 8, 2022,
the direct purchaser plaintiffs filed objections to the recommendation. On
April 13, 2022, the district court denied the direct purchaser plaintiffs'
renewed motion for class certification. In August 2021, the district court
granted certification of a class of indirect purchasers.

In 2020 and 2021, United Healthcare Services, Inc., Humana Inc., Centene
Corporation and others, and Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (collectively,
the Insurer Plaintiffs), each filed a lawsuit in a jurisdiction outside of the
Eastern District of Virginia against the Merck Defendants and others, making
similar allegations as those made in the Zetia MDL, as well as additional
allegations about Vytorin. These cases have been transferred to the Eastern
District of Virginia to proceed with the Zetia MDL.

On February 9, 2022, the Insurer Plaintiffs filed amended complaints. On March
2, 2022, the Merck Defendants, jointly with other defendants, moved to dismiss
certain aspects of the Insurer Plaintiffs' complaints, including any claims
for Vytorin damages. That motion to dismiss the Vytorin-related claims is
still pending.

106

Table of Contents

In April 2022, the direct purchaser plaintiffs moved for an order setting a
deadline for direct purchasers of Zetia not currently parties to the case to
file cases against defendants in order for those cases to be coordinated for
trial with the existing direct purchaser plaintiffs and other Zetia MDL
plaintiff groups. The court granted that motion, setting a deadline of June
30, 2022 for unnamed direct purchasers to file claims. On June 30, 2022, 23
new entities, many related, brought new complaints against defendants or
otherwise sought to intervene.

On February 10, 2023, the district court denied the Merck Defendants' and
Glenmark defendants' motions for summary judgment. In the cases filed by
direct purchaser plaintiffs, retailer plaintiffs, and indirect purchaser
plaintiffs, plaintiffs seek up to a maximum of $12.7 billion in damages after
trebling. The court has scheduled trial for these plaintiffs (all plaintiffs
other than the Insurer Plaintiffs) for April 17, 2023.

Bravecto Litigation

As previously disclosed, in January 2020, the Company was served with a
complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. Following
motion practice, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on July 1,
2021, seeking to certify a nationwide class action of purchasers or users of
Bravecto (fluralaner) products in the U.S. or its territories between May 1,
2014 and July 1, 2021. Plaintiffs contend Bravecto causes neurological events
in dogs and cats and alleges violations of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act,
Breach of Warranty, Product Liability, and related theories. The Company moved
to dismiss or, alternatively, to strike the class allegations from the second
amended complaint, and that motion is pending. A similar case was filed in
Quebec, Canada in May 2019. The Superior Court certified a class of dog owners
in Quebec who gave Bravecto Chew to their dogs between February 16, 2017 and
November 2, 2018 whose dogs experienced one of the conditions in the post-
marketing adverse reactions section of the labeling approved on November 2,
2018. The Company and plaintiffs each appealed the class certification
decision. The Court of Appeal of Quebec heard the appeal on February 7, 2022
and took the matter under advisement.

340B Program Litigation

Merck has filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia to challenge the letter Merck received from the Health Resources and
Services Administration (HRSA) in May 2022 regarding Merck's 340B Program
integrity initiative. HRSA's letter to Merck asserts that Merck is in
violation of the 340B statute. HRSA further claims that continued failure to
provide the 340B price to covered entities using contract pharmacies may
result in civil monetary penalties for each instance of alleged overcharging,
in addition to repayment for any instance of overcharging. The letter is very
similar to letters HRSA has sent to other manufacturers, which letters have
been held to be unlawful by multiple federal courts. Merck disagrees with
HRSA's assertion. Merck remains committed to the 340B Program and to providing
340B discounts to eligible covered entities. Merck's 340B Program integrity
initiative is consistent with the requirements of the 340B statute and is
intended to ensure the integrity and sustainability of the 340B statute by
reducing prohibited duplicate discounts and diversion and putting patients
back at the center of the program. Merck continues to offer all of the
Company's covered outpatient drugs to all 340B covered entities for purchase
at or below the 340B ceiling price. On September 13, 2022, the court stayed
the case pending the D.C. Circuit's ruling in Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp.
v. Johnson and United Therapeutics Corp. v. Johnson.

Qui Tam Litigation

As previously disclosed, in June 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania unsealed a complaint that had been filed against the
Company under the federal False Claims Act by two former employees alleging,
among other things, that the Company defrauded the U.S. government by
falsifying data in connection with a clinical study conducted on the mumps
component of the Company's M-M-R II vaccine. The complaint alleges the fraud
took place between 1999 and 2001. The U.S. government had the right to
participate in and take over the prosecution of this lawsuit but notified the
court that it declined to exercise that right. The two former employees are
pursuing the lawsuit without the involvement of the U.S. government. In
addition, as previously disclosed, two putative class action lawsuits on
behalf of direct purchasers of the M‑M‑R II vaccine, which charge that the
Company misrepresented the efficacy of the M-M-R II vaccine in violation of
federal antitrust laws and various state consumer protection laws, are pending
in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In September 2014, the court denied
Merck's motion to dismiss the False Claims Act suit and granted in part and
denied in part its motion to dismiss the then-pending antitrust suit. As a
result, both the False Claims Act suit and the antitrust suits proceeded into
discovery, which is now complete, and the parties have filed and briefed
cross-motions for summary judgment, which are currently pending before the
court.

Merck KGaA Litigation

As previously disclosed, in January 2016, to protect its long-established
brand rights in the U.S., the Company filed a lawsuit against Merck KGaA,
Darmstadt, Germany (KGaA), historically operating as the EMD Group in the
U.S., alleging it improperly uses the name "Merck" in the U.S. KGaA has filed
suit against the Company in a number of jurisdictions outside of the U.S.
alleging, among other things, unfair competition, trademark infringement

107

* * *

Table of Contents

and/or corporate name infringement. In certain of those jurisdictions, KGaA
also alleges breach of the parties' coexistence agreement. The litigation is
ongoing in the U.S. with no trial date set, and also ongoing in jurisdictions
outside of the U.S.

Patent Litigation

From time to time, generic manufacturers of pharmaceutical products file
abbreviated New Drug Applications (NDAs) with the FDA seeking to market
generic forms of the Company's products prior to the expiration of relevant
patents owned by the Company. To protect its patent rights, the Company may
file patent infringement lawsuits against such generic companies. Similar
lawsuits defending the Company's patent rights may exist in other countries.
The Company intends to vigorously defend its patents, which it believes are
valid, against infringement by companies attempting to market products prior
to the expiration of such patents. As with any litigation, there can be no
assurance of the outcomes, which, if adverse, could result in significantly
shortened periods of exclusivity for these products and, with respect to
products acquired through acquisitions accounted for as business combinations,
potentially significant intangible asset impairment charges.

Bridion -- As previously disclosed, between January and November 2020, the
Company received multiple Paragraph IV Certification Letters under the Hatch-
Waxman Act notifying the Company that generic drug companies have filed
applications to the FDA seeking pre-patent expiry approval to sell generic
versions of Bridion (sugammadex) Injection. In March, April and December 2020,
the Company filed patent infringement lawsuits in the U.S. District Courts for
the District of New Jersey and the Northern District of West Virginia against
those generic companies. All actions in the District of New Jersey have been
consolidated. These lawsuits, which assert one or more patents covering
sugammadex and methods of using sugammadex, automatically stay FDA approval of
the generic applications until June 2023 or until adverse court decisions, if
any, whichever may occur earlier. The West Virginia case was jointly dismissed
with prejudice on August 8, 2022 in favor of proceeding in New Jersey. The
remaining defendants in the New Jersey action have stipulated to infringement
of the asserted claims and have stated they are withdrawing all remaining
claims and defenses other than a defense seeking to shorten the patent term
extension of the sugammadex patent to December 2022. The U.S. District Court
for the District of New Jersey held a one-day trial on December 19, 2022 on
this remaining patent term extension calculation defense. The court ordered a
post-trial briefing on this defense and held closing arguments on February 3,
2023.

The Company has settled with five generic companies providing that these
generic companies can bring their generic versions of Bridion to the market in
January 2026 (which may be delayed by any applicable pediatric exclusivity) or
earlier under certain circumstances. The Company has agreed to stay the
lawsuit filed against two generic companies, which in exchange agreed to be
bound by a judgment on the merits of the consolidated action in the District
of New Jersey. One of the generic companies in the consolidated action
requested dismissal of the action against it and the Company did not oppose
this request, which was subsequently granted by the court. The Company does
not expect this company to bring its generic version of Bridion to the market
before January 2026 or later, depending on any applicable pediatric
exclusivity, unless the Company receives an adverse court decision.

Januvia, Janumet, Janumet XR -- As previously disclosed, the FDA granted
pediatric exclusivity with respect to Januvia (sitagliptin), Janumet
(sitagliptin/metformin HCl), and Janumet XR (sitagliptin and metformin HCl
extended-release), which provides a further six months of exclusivity in the
U.S. beyond the expiration of all patents listed in the FDA's Orange Book.
Adding this exclusivity to the term of the key patent protection extended
exclusivity on these products to January 2023. However, Januvia, Janumet, and
Janumet XR contain sitagliptin phosphate monohydrate and the Company has
another patent covering certain phosphate salt and polymorphic forms of
sitagliptin that expires in May 2027, including pediatric exclusivity (2027
salt/polymorph patent). In 2019, Par Pharmaceutical filed suit against the
Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey seeking a
declaratory judgment of invalidity of the 2027 salt/polymorph patent. In
response, the Company filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District
Court for the District of Delaware against Par Pharmaceutical and additional
companies that also indicated an intent to market generic versions of Januvia,
Janumet, and Janumet XR following expiration of key patent protection, but
prior to the expiration of the 2027 salt/polymorph patent, and a later granted
patent owned by the Company covering the Janumet formulation where its term
plus the pediatric exclusivity ends in 2029. The Company also filed a patent
infringement lawsuit against Mylan in the Northern District of West Virginia.
The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation entered an order transferring
the Company's lawsuit against Mylan to the U.S. District Court for the
District of Delaware for coordinated and consolidated pretrial proceedings
with the other cases pending in that district.

Prior to the beginning of the scheduled October 2021 trial in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Delaware on invalidity issues, the Company
settled with all defendants scheduled to participate in that trial. In the
Company's case against Mylan, a bench trial was held in December 2021 in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia, and the
closing arguments were held on April 13, 2022. On September 21, 2022, the
District

108

* * *

Table of Contents

Court for the Northern District of West Virginia issued a decision in the
Company's favor, upholding all asserted patent claims. Mylan (now Viatris) has
appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

In total, the Company has settled with 22 generic companies providing that
these generic companies can bring their generic versions of Januvia and
Janumet to the market in May 2026 or earlier under certain circumstances, and
their generic versions of Janumet XR to the market in July 2026 or earlier
under certain circumstances.

Additionally, in 2019, Mylan filed a petition for inter partes review (IPR) at
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) seeking invalidity of some, but
not all, of the claims of the 2027 salt/polymorph patent. The USPTO instituted
IPR proceedings in May 2020, finding a reasonable likelihood that the
challenged claims are not valid. A trial was held in February 2021 and a final
decision was rendered in May 2021, holding that all of the challenged claims
were not invalid. Mylan appealed the USPTO's decision to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and a hearing was held on August 2, 2022. On
September 29, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in
the Company's favor, upholding the USPTO's decision. Mylan submitted a
combined petition for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc, for which the
Company was invited by the court to provide a response. On February 3, 2023,
the court issued a per curiam decision denying both rehearing requests.

In March 2021, the Company filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Delaware against Zydus Worldwide DMCC,
Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc., and Cadila Healthcare Ltd. (collectively,
Zydus). In that lawsuit, the Company alleged infringement of the 2027
salt/polymorph patent based on the filing of Zydus's NDA seeking approval of
its sitagliptin tablets. In December 2022, the parties reached settlement that
included dismissal of the case without prejudice enabling Zydus to seek final
approval of a non-automatically substitutable product containing a different
form of sitagliptin than that used in Januvia, Janumet and Janumet XR.

As a result of these favorable court rulings and settlement agreements related
to the later expiring patent directed to the specific sitagliptin salt form of
the products, the Company expects that these products will not lose market
exclusivity in the U.S. until May 2026. However, certain of the rulings are
currently being appealed, and an unfavorable court decision would likely cause
the products to lose exclusivity toward the end of 2023.

Generic companies have sought revocation of the Supplementary Protection
Certificate (SPC) for Janumet in a number of European countries. In February
2022, a Finnish court referred certain questions to the Court of Justice of
the European Union that could determine the validity of the Janumet SPCs in
Europe, for which there will be an oral hearing on March 8, 2023. In first
instance decisions, the Janumet SPC has been found invalid in Germany and
Romania, and has been upheld in Czech Republic and Sweden. Appeals are pending
in Germany, Czech Republic and Sweden. The Company has filed for injunctive
relief in Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland,
Portugal, Switzerland and Slovakia. An ex-parte preliminary injunction was
granted in Finland, which has been subsequently maintained in inter-partes
proceedings, Czech Republic and Switzerland, and an inter-partes preliminary
injunction has been granted in Ireland. A preliminary injunction was granted
in France and the validity of the SPC and the associated patent were held to
be prima facie valid. Preliminary injunctions have been refused in Portugal,
Greece, Belgium and Hungary. In Belgium, the Company has filed a main
infringement action against generic companies and a request for preliminary
measures in that action has been refused.

Lynparza -- In December 2022, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP received a
Paragraph IV Certification Letter under the Hatch-Waxman Act notifying
AstraZeneca that Natco Pharma Limited (Natco) has filed an application to the
FDA seeking pre-patent expiry approval to sell generic versions of Lynparza
(olaparib) tablet. In February 2023, AstraZeneca and the Company filed a
patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New
Jersey/Delaware against Natco. This lawsuit, which asserts one or more patents
covering olaparib, automatically stays FDA approval of the generic application
until June 2025 or until an adverse court decision, if any, whichever may
occur earlier.

Other Litigation

There are various other pending legal proceedings involving the Company,
principally product liability and intellectual property lawsuits. While it is
not feasible to predict the outcome of such proceedings, in the opinion of the
Company, either the likelihood of loss is remote or any reasonably possible
loss associated with the resolution of such proceedings is not expected to be
material to the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows either individually or in the aggregate.

Legal Defense Reserves

Legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss
contingency are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. Some of the
significant factors considered in the review of these legal defense reserves
are as follows: the actual costs incurred by the Company; the development of
the Company's legal defense strategy and structure in light of the scope of
its litigation; the number of cases being brought against the Company;

109

* * *

Table of Contents

the costs and outcomes of completed trials and the most current information
regarding anticipated timing, progression, and related costs of pre-trial
activities and trials in the associated litigation. The amount of legal
defense reserves as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 of approximately $230
million represents the Company's best estimate of the minimum amount of
defense costs to be incurred in connection with its outstanding litigation;
however, events such as additional trials and other events that could arise in
the course of its litigation could affect the ultimate amount of legal defense
costs to be incurred by the Company. The Company will continue to monitor its
legal defense costs and review the adequacy of the associated reserves and may
determine to increase the reserves at any time in the future if, based upon
the factors set forth, it believes it would be appropriate to do so.

Environmental Matters

The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to a number of proceedings
brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and other federal and state
equivalents. These proceedings seek to require the operators of hazardous
waste disposal facilities, transporters of waste to the sites and generators
of hazardous waste disposed of at the sites to clean up the sites or to
reimburse the government for cleanup costs. The Company has been made a party
to these proceedings as an alleged generator of waste disposed of at the
sites. In each case, the government alleges that the defendants are jointly
and severally liable for the cleanup costs. Although joint and several
liability is alleged, these proceedings are frequently resolved so that the
allocation of cleanup costs among the parties more nearly reflects the
relative contributions of the parties to the site situation. The Company's
potential liability varies greatly from site to site. For some sites the
potential liability is de minimis and for others the final costs of cleanup
have not yet been determined. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome
of many of these proceedings brought by federal or state agencies or private
litigants, in the opinion of the Company, such proceedings should not
ultimately result in any liability which would have a material adverse effect
on the financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of the Company.
The Company has taken an active role in identifying and accruing for these
costs and such amounts do not include any reduction for anticipated recoveries
of cleanup costs from former site owners or operators or other recalcitrant
potentially responsible parties.

In management's opinion, the liabilities for all environmental matters that
are probable and reasonably estimable have been accrued and totaled $39
million and $40 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These
liabilities are undiscounted, do not consider potential recoveries from other
parties and will be paid out over the periods of remediation for the
applicable sites, which are expected to occur primarily over the next 15
years. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of
these matters, or the ultimate costs of remediation, management does not
believe that any reasonably possible expenditures that may be incurred in
excess of the liabilities accrued should exceed approximately $35 million in
the aggregate. Management also does not believe that these expenditures should
result in a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition,
results of operations or liquidity for any year.

12. Equity

The Merck certificate of incorporation authorizes 6,500,000,000 shares of
common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock.

13. Share-Based Compensation Plans

The Company has share-based compensation plans under which the Company grants
restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance share units (PSUs) to certain
management level employees. In addition, employees

110

* * *

Table of Contents

and non-employee directors may be granted options to purchase shares of
Company common stock at the fair market value at the time of grant. These
plans were approved by the Company's shareholders.

At December 31, 2022, 87 million shares collectively were authorized for
future grants under the Company's share-based compensation plans. These awards
are settled with treasury shares.

Employee stock options are granted to purchase shares of Company stock at the
fair market value at the time of grant. These awards generally vest one-third
each year over a three-year period, with a contractual term of 7-10 years.
RSUs are stock awards that are granted to employees and entitle the holder to
shares of common stock as the awards vest. The fair value of the stock option
and RSU awards is determined and fixed on the grant date based on the
Company's stock price. PSUs are stock awards where the ultimate number of
shares issued will be contingent on the Company's performance against a pre-
set objective or set of objectives. The fair value of each PSU is determined
on the date of grant based on the Company's stock price. For RSUs and PSUs,
dividends declared during the vesting period are payable to the employees only
upon vesting. Over the PSU performance period, the number of shares of stock
that are expected to be issued will be adjusted based on the probability of
achievement of a performance target and final compensation expense will be
recognized based on the ultimate number of shares issued. RSU and PSU
distributions will be in shares of Company stock after the end of the vesting
or performance period, subject to the terms applicable to such awards. PSU
awards generally vest after three years. RSU awards generally vest one-third
each year over a three-year period.

Total pretax share-based compensation cost recorded in 2022, 2021 and 2020 was
$541 million, $498 million and $475 million, respectively. The amounts in 2021
and 2020 include $479 million and $441 million, respectively, related to
continuing operations. Income tax benefits for share-based compensation
expense recognized in 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $78 million, $69 million and
$65 million, respectively.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model for determining the
fair value of option grants. In applying this model, the Company uses both
historical data and current market data to estimate the fair value of its
options. The Black-Scholes model requires several assumptions including
expected dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, volatility, and term of the
options. The expected dividend yield is based on historical patterns of
dividend payments. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate at grant
date of zero-coupon U.S. Treasury Notes with a term equal to the expected term
of the option. Expected volatility is estimated using a blend of historical
and implied volatility. The historical component is based on historical
monthly price changes. The implied volatility is obtained from market data on
the Company's traded options. The expected life represents the amount of time
that options granted are expected to be outstanding, based on historical and
forecasted exercise behavior.

The weighted average exercise price of options granted in 2022, 2021 and 2020
was $87.10, $75.99 and $77.67 per option, respectively. The weighted average
fair value of options granted in 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $15.45, $9.80 and
$9.93 per option, respectively, and were determined using the following
assumptions:

termination benefits provided to certain employees in connection with the
spin-off of Organon.

In connection with restructuring actions (see Note 6), termination charges
were recorded in 2022, 2021 and 2020 on pension and other postretirement
benefit plans related to expanded eligibility for certain employees exiting
Merck. Also, in connection with these restructuring activities, curtailments
and settlements were recorded on certain pension plans. An increase in lump
sum payments to U.S. pension plan participants also contributed to the
settlements recorded during 2022 and 2021.

Plan Assets

Entities are required to use a fair value hierarchy which maximizes the use of
observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring
fair value. There are three levels of inputs used to measure fair value with
Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest:

Level 1 -- Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities.

Level 2 -- Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices
for similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can
be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of
the assets or liabilities.

Level 3 -- Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market
activity. The Level 3 assets are those whose values are determined using
pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques with
significant unobservable inputs, as well as instruments for which the
determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. At
December 31, 2022 and 2021, $765 million and $943 million, respectively, or
approximately 4% of the Company's pension investments were categorized as
Level 3 assets.

If the inputs used to measure the financial assets fall within more than one
level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.

and 2021.

The Company has established investment guidelines for its U.S. pension and
other postretirement plans to create an asset allocation that is expected to
deliver a rate of return sufficient to meet the long-term obligation of each
plan, given an acceptable level of risk. The target investment portfolio of
the Company's U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans is allocated
25% to 40% in U.S. equities, 10% to 20% in international equities, 35% to 45%
in fixed-income investments, and up to 8% in cash and other investments. The
portfolio's equity weighting is consistent with the long-term nature of the
plans' benefit obligations. The expected annual standard deviation of

116

returns of the target portfolio, which approximates 10%, reflects both the
equity allocation and the diversification benefits among the asset classes in
which the portfolio invests. For international pension plans, the targeted
investment portfolio varies based on the duration of pension liabilities and
local government rules and regulations. Although a significant percentage of
plan assets are invested in U.S. equities, concentration risk is mitigated
through the use of strategies that are diversified within management
guidelines.

Expected Contributions

Contributions during 2023 are expected to be approximately $270 million for
U.S. pension plans, approximately $150 million for international pension plans
and approximately $20 million for other postretirement benefit plans.

Expected Benefit Payments

Expected benefit payments are as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| U.S. Pension Benefits| | International Pension  
Benefits| | Other

2028 -- 2032| 3,948 | | | 1,704 | | | 474 |  
  
Expected benefit payments are based on the same assumptions used to measure
the benefit obligations and include estimated future employee service.

Amounts Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income

Net gain/loss amounts reflect differences between expected and actual returns
on plan assets as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions. Net
gain/loss amounts in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into net
periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service life of employees.
The following amounts were reflected as components of OCI:

Actuarial Assumptions

The Company reassesses its benefit plan assumptions on a regular basis. The
weighted average assumptions used in determining U.S. pension and other
postretirement benefit plan and international pension plan information are as
follows:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| U.S. Pension and Other  
Postretirement Benefit Plans| | International Pension Plans  
December 31| 2022| | 2021| | 2020| | 2022| | 2021| | 2020  
Net periodic benefit cost|  | |  | |  | |  | |  | |  
Discount rate| 3.00 | %| | 2.70 | %| | 3.40 | %| | 1.50 | %| | 1.10 | %| |
1.50 | %  
Expected rate of return on plan assets| 6.70 | %| | 6.70 | %| | 7.30 | %| |
3.70 | %| | 3.80 | %| | 4.40 | %  
Salary growth rate| 4.60 | %| | 4.60 | %| | 4.20 | %| | 2.90 | %| | 2.80 | %|
| 2.80 | %  
Interest crediting rate| 5.00 | %| | 4.70 | %| | 4.90 | %| | 3.00 | %| | 3.00
| %| | 2.80 | %  
Benefit obligation|  | |  | |  | |  | |  | |  
Discount rate| 5.50 | %| | 3.00 | %| | 2.70 | %| | 3.90 | %| | 1.50 | %| |
1.10 | %  
Salary growth rate| 4.60 | %| | 4.60 | %| | 4.60 | %| | 3.20 | %| | 2.90 | %|
| 2.80 | %  
Interest crediting rate| 5.30 | %| | 5.00 | %| | 4.70 | %| | 3.30 | %| | 3.00
| %| | 3.00 | %  
  
For both the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the discount rate
is evaluated on measurement dates and modified to reflect the prevailing
market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income debt instruments that
would provide the future cash flows needed to pay the benefits included in the
benefit obligation as they come due. The expected rate of return for both the
pension and other postretirement benefit plans represents the average rate of
return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in
the benefit obligation are to be paid and is determined on a plan basis. The
expected rate of return for each plan is developed considering long-term
historical returns data, current market conditions, and actual returns on the
plan assets. Using this reference information, the long-term return
expectations for each asset category and a weighted-average expected return
for each plan's target portfolio is developed according to the allocation
among those investment categories. The expected portfolio performance reflects
the contribution of active management as appropriate. For 2023, the expected
rate of return for the Company's U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit
plans will be 7.00%, as compared to 6.70% in 2022.

The health care cost trend rate assumptions for other postretirement benefit
plans are as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
December 31| 2022| | 2021  
Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year| 7.8 | %| | 6.4 | %  
Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline| 4.5 | %| | 4.5 | %  
Year that the trend rate reaches the ultimate trend rate| 2038| | 2032  
  
  

Savings Plans

The Company also maintains defined contribution savings plans in the U.S. The
Company matches a percentage of each employee's contributions consistent with
the provisions of the plan for which the employee is eligible. Total employer
contributions to these plans in 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $175 million, $158
million and $158 million, respectively.

equity securities either owned directly or through ownership interests in
investment funds. Unrealized gains and losses from investments that are
directly owned are determined at the end of the reporting period, while gains
and losses from ownership interests in investment funds are accounted for on a
one quarter lag. The Company estimates gains of approximately $140 million
will be recorded in the first quarter of 2023 from ownership interests in
investment funds.

Interest paid was $937 million in 2022, $779 million in 2021 and $822 million
in 2020.

16. Taxes on Income

A reconciliation between the effective tax rate for income from continuing
operations and the U.S. statutory rate is as follows:

%  
  
Where applicable, the impact of changes in uncertain tax positions is
reflected in the reconciling items above.

The Company's remaining transition tax liability under the Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act (TCJA) of 2017, which has been reduced by payments and the utilization of
foreign tax credits, was $2.2 billion at December 31, 2022, of which $732
million is included in Income taxes payable and the remainder of $1.5 billion
is included in Other Noncurrent Liabilities. As a result of the transition tax
under the TCJA, the Company is no longer indefinitely reinvested with respect
to its undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries and has provided a
deferred tax liability for foreign withholding taxes that would apply. The
Company remains indefinitely reinvested with respect to its financial
statement basis in excess of tax basis of its foreign subsidiaries. A
determination of the deferred tax liability with respect to this basis
difference is not practicable.

The foreign earnings tax rate differentials in the tax rate reconciliation
above primarily reflect the impacts of operations in jurisdictions with
different tax rates than the U.S., particularly Ireland and Switzerland, as
well as Singapore and Puerto Rico which operate under tax incentive grants
(which begin to expire in 2025), thereby yielding

119

a favorable impact on the effective tax rate compared with the U.S. statutory
rate of 21%. The Company has an additional Cantonal tax holiday in Switzerland
that provides for a tax rate reduction and is effective through 2032.

The Company has net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards in several
jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2022, $349 million of deferred tax assets on
NOL carryforwards relate to foreign jurisdictions. Valuation allowances of
$345 million have been established on these foreign NOL carryforwards and
other foreign deferred tax assets. In addition, the Company has $563 million
of deferred tax assets relating to various U.S. tax credit carryforwards and

120

NOL carryforwards. Valuation allowances of $247 million have been established
on these U.S. tax credit carryforwards and NOL carryforwards.

Income taxes paid in 2022, 2021 and 2020 (including amounts attributable to
discontinued operations in 2021 and 2020) were $3.2 billion, $2.4 billion and
$2.7 billion, respectively. Income taxes paid consisted of:

(1) Includes TCJA transition tax payments.

Tax benefits relating to stock option exercises were $45 million in 2022, $21
million in 2021 and $12 million in 2020.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax
benefits is as follows:

(1) Amount in 2021 reflects a settlement with the IRS discussed below.

If the Company were to recognize the unrecognized tax benefits of $1.8 billion
at December 31, 2022, the income tax provision would reflect a favorable net
impact of $1.8 billion.

The Company is under examination by numerous tax authorities in various
jurisdictions globally. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible
that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022
could decrease by up to approximately $31 million in the next 12 months as a
result of various audit closures, settlements or the expiration of the statute
of limitations. The ultimate finalization of the Company's examinations with
relevant taxing authorities can include formal administrative and legal
proceedings, which could have a significant impact on the timing of the
reversal of unrecognized tax benefits. The Company believes that its reserves
for uncertain tax positions are adequate to cover existing risks or exposures.

Interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions amounted to an
expense (benefit) of $54 million in 2022, $(37) million in 2021 and $16
million in 2020. These amounts reflect the beneficial impacts of various tax
settlements, including the settlement discussed below. Liabilities for accrued
interest and penalties were $256 million and $192 million as of December 31,
2022 and 2021, respectively.

In 2021, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concluded its examinations of
Merck's 2015-2016 U.S. federal income tax returns. As a result, the Company
was required to make a payment of $190 million (of which $172 million related
to continuing operations and $18 million related to discontinued operations).
The Company's reserves for unrecognized tax benefits for the years under
examination exceeded the adjustments relating to this examination period and
therefore the Company recorded a $236 million net tax benefit in 2021 (of
which $207 million related to continuing operations and $29 million related to
discontinued operations). This net benefit reflects reductions in reserves for
unrecognized tax benefits and other related liabilities for tax positions
relating to the years that were under examination.

The IRS is currently conducting examinations of the Company's tax returns for
the years 2017 and 2018. In addition, various state and foreign tax
examinations are in progress and for these jurisdictions, the Company's income
tax returns are open for examination for the period 2003 through 2022.

In 2022, 2021 and 2020, 2 million, 9 million and 5 million, respectively, of
common shares issuable under share-based compensation plans were excluded from
the computation of earnings per common share assuming dilution because the
effect would have been antidilutive.

19. Segment Reporting

The Company's operations are principally managed on a product basis and
include two operating segments, Pharmaceutical and Animal Health, both of
which are reportable segments.

The Pharmaceutical segment includes human health pharmaceutical and vaccine
products. Human health pharmaceutical products consist of therapeutic and
preventive agents, generally sold by prescription, for the treatment of human
disorders. The Company sells these human health pharmaceutical products
primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies
and managed health care providers such as health maintenance organizations,
pharmacy benefit managers and other institutions. Human health vaccine
products consist of preventive pediatric, adolescent and adult vaccines. The
Company sells these human health vaccines primarily to physicians,
wholesalers, physician distributors and government entities. A large component
of pediatric and adolescent vaccine sales are made to the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention Vaccines for Children program, which is funded
by the U.S. government. Additionally, the Company sells vaccines to the
Federal government for placement into vaccine stockpiles.

The Animal Health segment discovers, develops, manufactures and markets a wide
range of veterinary pharmaceutical and vaccine products, as well as health
management solutions and services, for the prevention, treatment and control
of disease in all major livestock and companion animal species. The Company
also offers an extensive suite of digitally connected identification,
traceability and monitoring products. The Company sells its products to
veterinarians, distributors, animal producers, farmers and pet owners.

The Company previously had a Healthcare Services segment that provided
services and solutions focused on engagement, health analytics and clinical
services to improve the value of care delivered to patients. The Company
divested the remaining businesses in this segment during the first quarter of
2020.

Pharmaceutical segment profits are comprised of segment sales less standard
costs, as well as selling, general and administrative expenses directly
incurred by the segment. Animal Health segment profits are comprised of
segment sales, less all cost of sales, as well as selling, general and
administrative expenses and research and development costs directly incurred
by the segment. For internal management reporting presented to the chief
operating decision maker, Merck does not allocate the remaining cost of sales
not included in segment profits as described above, research and development
expenses incurred in Merck Research Laboratories, the Company's research and
development division that focuses on human health-related activities, or
general and administrative expenses, nor the cost of financing these
activities. Separate divisions maintain responsibility for monitoring and
managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utilized
by these divisions and, therefore, they are not included in segment profits.
In addition, costs related to restructuring activities, as well as the
amortization of intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments are not
allocated to segments.

Other profits are primarily comprised of miscellaneous corporate profits, as
well as operating profits related to third-party manufacturing arrangements.

Other unallocated, net, includes expenses from corporate and manufacturing
cost centers, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, gains or
losses on sales of businesses, expense or income related to changes in the
estimated fair value measurement of liabilities for contingent consideration,
and other miscellaneous income or expense items.

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Merck & Co., Inc.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Merck & Co.,
Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of
equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as
the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on
criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial
statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to
express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the
Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent
with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the
current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that
(i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated
financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective,
or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not
alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken
as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,
providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts
or disclosures to which it relates.

U.S. Rebate Accruals - Medicaid, Managed Care and Medicare Part D

As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
records certain variable consideration including discounts, which are
estimated at the time of sale generally using the expected value method.
Amounts accrued for aggregate customer discounts are evaluated on a quarterly
basis through comparison of information provided by the wholesalers, health
maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, federal and state
agencies, and other customers to the amounts accrued. Certain of these
discounts representing a portion of the accrual take the form of rebates,
which are amounts owed based upon definitive contractual agreements or legal
requirements with private sector (Managed Care) and public sector (Medicaid
and Medicare Part D) benefit providers, after the final dispensing of the
product to a benefit plan participant. The provision for rebates is based on
expected patient usage, as well as inventory levels in the distribution
channel to determine the contractual obligation to the benefit providers.
Management uses historical customer segment utilization mix, sales forecasts,
changes to product mix and price, inventory levels in the distribution
channel, government pricing calculations and prior payment history in order to
estimate the expected provision. The accrued balance relative to the provision
for rebates included in accrued and other current liabilities was $2.7 billion
as of December 31, 2022, of which the majority relates to U.S. rebate accruals
- Medicaid, Managed Care and Medicare Part D.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures
relating to U.S. rebate accruals - Medicaid, Managed Care and Medicare Part D
is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management due to
the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing the rebate
accruals, as the accruals are based on assumptions developed using pricing
information and historical customer segment utilization mix, and a high degree
of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and
evaluating evidence related to these assumptions.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit
evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of
controls relating to U.S. rebate accruals - Medicaid, Managed Care and
Medicare Part D, including management's controls over the assumptions used to
estimate the corresponding rebate accruals. These procedures also included,
among others (i) developing an independent estimate of the rebate accruals by
utilizing third party data on historical customer segment utilization mix in
the U.S., pricing information, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and
the historical trend of actual rebate claims paid, (ii) comparing the
independent estimate to the rebate accruals recorded by management, and (iii)
testing rebate claims paid, including evaluating those claims for consistency
with the contractual terms of the Company's rebate agreements.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
Financial Disclosure.

Not applicable.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

Management of the Company, with the participation of its Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on their evaluation, as of
the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K, the Company's Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Act)) are
effective. For the fourth quarter of 2022, there have been no changes in
internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over
financial reporting.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of
the Act. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control --
Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management
concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2022. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, has performed its own assessment of the effectiveness
of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and its attestation
report is included in this Form 10-K filing.

Management's Report

Management's Responsibility for Financial Statements

Responsibility for the integrity and objectivity of the Company's financial
statements rests with management. The financial statements report on
management's stewardship of Company assets. These statements are prepared in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and, accordingly,
include amounts that are based on management's best estimates and judgments.
Nonfinancial information included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K has also
been prepared by management and is consistent with the financial statements.

To assure that financial information is reliable and assets are safeguarded,
management maintains an effective system of internal controls and procedures,
important elements of which include: careful selection, training and
development of operating and financial managers; an organization that provides
appropriate division of responsibility; and communications aimed at assuring
that Company policies and procedures are understood throughout the
organization. A staff of internal auditors regularly monitors the adequacy and
application of internal controls on a worldwide basis.

To ensure that personnel continue to understand the system of internal
controls and procedures, and policies concerning good and prudent business
practices, annually all employees of the Company are required to complete Code
of Conduct training. This training reinforces the importance and understanding
of internal controls by reviewing key corporate policies, procedures and
systems. In addition, the Company has compliance programs, including an
ethical business practices program to reinforce the Company's long-standing
commitment to high ethical standards in the conduct of its business.

The financial statements and other financial information included in the
Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present, in all material respects, the
Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our
formal certification to the Securities and Exchange Commission is included in
this Form 10-K filing.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company's internal control over
financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America. Management conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the
framework in Internal Control -- Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on
this evaluation, management concluded that internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
