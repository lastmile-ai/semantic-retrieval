Research and Development

We are committed to continuous investment in product development and
enhancement, with a focus on rapidly introducing new, proprietary products and
releases. Many of our products have grown out of our own research and
development efforts, and have given us competitive advantages in certain
target markets due to performance differentiation. However, we
opportunistically seek to enhance our capabilities through the acquisition of
engineers with complementary research and development skills and complementary
technologies and businesses. We focus our research and development efforts on
the development of mission critical, innovative, sustainable and higher value
product platforms and those that improve the quality and stability in our
broadly deployed products. We leverage our design capabilities in markets
where we believe our innovation and reputation will allow us to earn
attractive margins by developing high value-add products.

We plan to continue investing in product development, both organically and
through acquisitions, to drive growth in our business. We also invest in
process development and improvements to product features and functions, as
well as fabrication capabilities to optimize processes for devices that are
manufactured internally. Our field application engineers, design engineers,
and product and software development engineers are located in many places
around the world, and in many cases near our top customers. This enhances our
customer reach and our visibility into new product opportunities and, in the
case of our semiconductor customers, enables us to support our customers in
each stage of their product development cycle, from the early stages of
production design to volume manufacturing and future growth. By collaborating
with our customers, we have opportunities to develop high value-added,
customized products for them that leverage our existing technologies. We
anticipate that we will continue to make significant research and development
expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position, and to ensure a
continuous flow of innovative and sustainable product platforms.

Customers, Sales and Distribution

We sell our products through our direct sales force and a select network of
distributors and channel partners globally. Distributors and OEMs, or their
contract manufacturers, typically account for the substantial majority of our
semiconductor sales. A relatively small number of customers account for a
significant portion of our net revenue. Sales to distributors accounted for
56% and 53% of our net revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.
We believe aggregate sales to our top five end customers, through all
channels, accounted for approximately 35% of our net revenue for each of our
fiscal years 2022 and 2021. We believe aggregate sales to Apple Inc., through
all channels, accounted for approximately 20% of our net revenue for each of
fiscal years 2022 and 2021. We expect to continue to experience significant
customer concentration in future periods. The loss of, or significant decrease
in demand from, any of our top five end customers could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Many of our semiconductor customers design products in North America or Europe
that are then manufactured in Asia. To serve customers around the world, we
have strategically developed relationships with large global electronic
component distributors, complemented by a number of regional distributors with
customer relationships based on their respective product ranges. We also sell
our products to a wide variety of OEMs or their contract manufacturers. We
have established

8

* * *

Table of Contents

strong relationships with leading OEM customers across multiple target
markets. Our direct sales force focuses on supporting our large OEM customers,
and has specialized product and service knowledge that enables us to sell
specific offerings at key levels throughout a customer's organization. Certain
customers require us to contract with them directly and with specified
intermediaries, such as contract manufacturers. Many of our major customer
relationships have been in place for many years and are often the result of
years of collaborative product development. This has enabled us to build our
extensive IP portfolio and develop critical expertise regarding our customers'
requirements, including substantial system-level knowledge. This collaboration
has provided us with key insights into our customers' businesses and has
enabled us to be more efficient and productive and to better serve our target
markets and customers. Many of our customers and their contract manufacturers
often require time critical delivery of our products to multiple locations
around the world. With sales offices located in various countries, our primary
warehouse in Malaysia, and dedicated regional customer support call centers,
where we address customer issues and handle logistics and other order
fulfillment requirements, we believe we are well-positioned to support our
customers throughout the design, technology transfer and manufacturing stages
across all geographies.

Our software customers are in most major industries worldwide, including
banks, insurance companies, other financial services providers, government
agencies, global IT service providers, telecommunication providers,
transportation companies, manufacturers, technology companies, retailers,
educational organizations and health care institutions. Our customers
generally consist of large enterprises that have computing environments from
multiple vendors and are highly complex. We remain focused on strengthening
relationships and increasing penetration within our existing core, mainframe-
centric, and Symantec endpoint customers and expanding the adoption of our
enterprise software offerings with these customers. We believe our enterprise-
wide license model will continue to offer our customers reduced complexity,
more flexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive revenue
growth.

Manufacturing Operations

We focus on maintaining an efficient global supply chain and a variable, low-
cost operating model. Accordingly, we outsource a majority of our
manufacturing operations, utilizing third-party foundry and assembly and test
capabilities, as well as some of our corporate infrastructure functions. The
majority of our front-end wafer manufacturing operations is outsourced to
external foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company
Limited ("TSMC"). We use third-party contract manufacturers for a significant
majority of our assembly and test operations, including Advanced Semiconductor
Engineering, Inc., Foxconn Technology Group, Amkor Technology, Inc. and
Siliconware Precision Industries Co., Ltd. We use our internal fabrication
facilities for products utilizing our innovative and proprietary processes,
such as our FBAR filters for wireless communications and our vertical-cavity
surface emitting laser and side emitting lasers-based on GaAs and InP lasers
for fiber optic communications, while outsourcing commodity processes such as
standard CMOS. By doing so, we can protect our IP and accelerate time to
market for our products. The majority of our internal III-V semiconductor
wafer fabrication is done in the U.S. and Singapore.

We also have a long history of operating in Asia where we manufacture and
source the majority of our products and materials. We store the majority of
our product inventory in our warehouse in Malaysia and our presence in Asia
places us in close proximity to many of our customers' manufacturing
facilities.

Manufacturing Materials and Suppliers

Our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors,
electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials. We purchase
materials from hundreds of suppliers on a global basis. These purchases are
generally on a purchase order basis and some parts are not readily available
from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time and
cost necessary for re-design or qualification. To address the potential
disruption in our supply chain, we may use a number of techniques, including
redesigning products for alternative components, making incremental or
"lifetime" purchases, or qualifying more than one source of supply. Our long-
term relationships with our suppliers allow us to proactively manage our
technology development and product discontinuance plans, and to monitor our
suppliers' financial health. Some suppliers may, nonetheless, extend their
lead times, limit supplies, increase prices or cease to produce necessary
parts for our products. If these are unique or highly specialized components,
we may not be able to find a substitute quickly, or at all.

Competition

The markets in which we participate are highly competitive. Our competitors
range from large, international companies offering a wide range of products to
smaller companies specializing in narrow markets. The competitive landscape is
changing as a result of a trend toward consolidation within many industries,
as some of our competitors have merged with or been acquired by other
competitors, while others have begun collaborating with each other. We expect
this consolidation trend to continue. We expect competition in the markets in
which we participate to continue to increase as existing competitors improve
or expand their product offerings and as new companies enter the market.
Additionally, our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of
factors, including: quality, technical performance, price, product features,
product system

Table of Contents

compatibility, system-level design capability, engineering expertise,
responsiveness to customers, new product innovation, product availability,
delivery timing and reliability, and customer sales and technical support.

In the semiconductor market, we compete with integrated device manufacturers,
fabless semiconductor companies, as well as the internal resources of large,
integrated OEMs. Our primary competitors are Amlogic Inc., Analog Devices,

processes, multiple storage protocols and mixed-signal design, our broad
product portfolio, support of key industry standards, reputation for quality
products, and our customer relationships.

In the infrastructure software market, we compete with large enterprise
software vendors who continue to expand their product and service offerings
and consolidate offerings into broad product lines, and smaller, niche players
focused on specific markets. Our primary competitors are Atlassian
Corporation, Plc, BMC Software Inc., BeyondTrust Corporation, Cisco Systems,
Inc., CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc., CyberArk Software, Ltd., International
Business Machines Corporation, Micro Focus International plc, Microsoft
Corporation, New Relic, Inc., Oracle Corporation, Proofpoint, Inc., Rocket
Software, Inc., SailPoint Technologies Holdings, Inc., Salesforce.com, Inc.,
ServiceNow, Inc., SolarWinds Corporation, Splunk, Inc. and Zscaler, Inc. We
compete based on our breadth of portfolio of enterprise management tools,
breadth and synergy of offerings, our platform and hardware independence, our
global reach, and our deep customer relationships and industry experience.

Intellectual Property

Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our IP. To accomplish
this, we rely on a combination of IP rights, including patents, copyrights,
trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and similar IP, as well as customary
contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, employees and
consultants, and through security measures to protect our trade secrets. We
believe our current product expertise, key engineering talent and IP portfolio
provide us with a strong platform from which to develop application specific
products in key target markets.

As of October 30, 2022, we had 17,035 U.S. and other patents and 618 U.S. and
other pending patent applications. The expiration dates of our patents range
from 2022 to 2041, with a small number of patents expiring in the near future,
none of which are expected to be material to our IP portfolio. We are not
substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents.

We focus our patent application program to a greater extent on those
inventions and improvements that we believe are likely to be incorporated into
our products, as contrasted with more basic research. However, we do not know
how many of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of
patents or the extent to which the examination process could require us to
narrow our claims.

We and our predecessors have also entered into a variety of IP licensing and
cross-licensing arrangements that have both benefited our business and enabled
some of our competitors. A portion of our revenue comes from IP licensing
royalty payments and from litigation settlements relating to such IP. We also
license third-party technologies that are incorporated into some elements of
our design activities, products and manufacturing processes. Historically,
licenses of the third-party technologies used by us have generally been
available to us on acceptable terms.

The industries in which we compete are characterized by the existence of a
large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by the
vigorous pursuit, protection and enforcement of IP rights, including by patent
holding companies that do not make or sell products. Some of our customer
agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party IP
infringement claims arising from our products. Claims of this sort could harm
our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from
doing business with us. With respect to any IP rights claims against us or our
customers or distributors, we may be required to defend ourselves or our
customers or distributors in litigation, cease manufacturing the infringing
products, pay damages, expend resources to develop non-infringing technology,
seek a license which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or
at all, or relinquish patents or other IP rights.

With respect to our infrastructure software, the proprietary portions of our
source code for our products are protected both as a trade secret and as
copyrighted works. Except with respect to software components that are subject
to open source licenses, our customers do not generally have access to the
source code for our products. Rather, on-premise customers typically access
only the executable code for our products, and SaaS customers access only the
functionality of our SaaS offerings. Under certain contingent circumstances,
some of our customers are beneficiaries of a source code escrow

10

arrangement that would enables them to obtain a limited right to access and
use our source code if specific conditions are met.

Employees

Our success depends on our continued ability to attract, motivate and retain
our workforce. As the source of our technological and product innovations, our
engineering and technical personnel are a significant asset. Competition for
these and other talented employees is significant in many locations where we
operate, such as Silicon Valley and Southeast Asia.

We measure our employees' engagement by our voluntary attrition rate and
employee feedback. Our global voluntary attrition rate in fiscal year 2022 was
approximately 6.5%, below the technology industry benchmark (AON, 2022 Salary
Increase and Turnover Study -- Second Edition, September 2022).

We also track the portion of our workforce in research and development roles.
As of October 30, 2022, we had approximately 20,000 employees worldwide, with
approximately 63% in research and development roles. By geography,
approximately 54% of our employees are located in North America, 35% in Asia,
and 11% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Governmental Regulation

Our semiconductor manufacturing operations and research and development
involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international,
federal, state and local laws governing health, safety and the environment.
These regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants to air,
water, and soil; remediation requirements; product chemical content
limitations; manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions; pollution
control requirements; waste minimization considerations; and treatment,
transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. We are also
subject to regulation by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health
Administration and similar health and safety laws in other jurisdictions.

We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all
material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and
safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be
completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of
environmental, health and safety laws to our business will not require us to
incur significant expenditures.

We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state and
local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content
requirements, including legislation enacted in the U.S., European Union and
China, among a growing number of jurisdictions, which have placed greater
restrictions on the use of lead, among other restricted substances, in
electronic products, which affects materials composition and semiconductor
packaging. In addition, our business is subject to various import/export
regulations, such as the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, and
applicable executive orders, and rules of industrial standards bodies, like
the International Organization for Standardization, as well as regulation by
other agencies, such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"). These laws,
regulations and orders are complex, may change frequently and with limited
notice, have generally and may continue to become more stringent over time. We
may incur significant expenditures in future periods as a result.

Seasonality

Historically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of
the fiscal year than in the first half, primarily due to seasonality in our
wireless communications products. These products have historically experienced
seasonality due to launches of new mobile devices manufactured by our OEM
customers. However, from time to time, typical seasonality and industry
cyclicality are overshadowed by other factors such as wider macroeconomic
effects, the timing of significant product transitions and launches by large
OEMs, particularly with our wireless communications products. We have a
diversified business portfolio and we believe that our overall revenue is less
susceptible to seasonal variations as a result of this diversification.

Risks Related to Our Business

Adverse global economic conditions could have a negative effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition and liquidity.

A general slowdown in the global economy, including a recession, or in a
particular region or industry, an increase in trade tensions with U.S. trading
partners, inflation or a tightening of the credit markets could negatively
impact our business, financial condition and liquidity. Adverse global
economic conditions have from time to time caused or exacerbated significant
slowdowns in the industries and markets in which we operate, which have
adversely affected our business and results of operations. Macroeconomic
weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to accurately
forecast revenue, gross margin and expenses, and may make it more difficult to
raise or refinance debt. An escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and
China has resulted in trade restrictions and increased tariffs that harm our
ability to participate in Chinese markets or compete effectively with Chinese
companies. Sustained uncertainty about, or worsening of, current global
economic conditions and further escalation of trade tensions between the U.S.
and its trading partners, especially China, and possible

14

Table of Contents

decoupling of the U.S. and China economies, could result in a global economic
slowdown and long-term changes to global trade. Such events may also (i) cause
our customers and consumers to reduce, delay or forgo technology spending,
(ii) result in customers sourcing products from other suppliers not subject to
such restrictions or tariffs, (iii) lead to the insolvency or consolidation of
key suppliers and customers, and (iv) intensify pricing pressures. Any or all
of these factors could negatively affect demand for our products and our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry.

The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by price
erosion, wide fluctuations in product supply and demand, constant and rapid
technological change, evolving technical standards, frequent new product
introductions, and short product life cycles (for semiconductors and for many
of the end products in which they are used). From time to time, these factors,
together with changes in general economic conditions, cause significant
upturns and downturns in the industry in general, and in our business in
particular. The industry recently experienced a significant upturn due to the
supply imbalance that resulted in record profitability and increases in
average selling prices. It is possible that this recent industry up-cycle will
be followed by a downturn, and historically, such down-cycles have been
characterized by diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory
levels and periods of inventory adjustment, under-utilization of manufacturing
capacity, changes in revenue mix, accelerated erosion of average selling
prices and elimination of expedite fees leading to reduced profitability and a
decline in our stock price. The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce
Semiconductors for America Act could also result in an increase in supply
leading to excess inventory and a decrease in average selling prices. We
expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturns even when
overall economic conditions are relatively stable. If we cannot offset
industry or market downturns, our net revenue may decline and our financial
condition and results of operations may suffer.

The majority of our sales come from a small number of customers and a
reduction in demand or loss of one or more of our significant customers may
adversely affect our business.

We are dependent on a small number of end customers, OEMs, their respective
contract manufacturers ("CMs"), and certain distributors for a majority of our
business and revenue. For fiscal year 2022, sales to distributors accounted
for 56% of our net revenue. We believe aggregate sales, through all channels,
to Apple and our top five end customers, accounted for approximately 20% and
35% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2022, respectively. This customer
concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our operating
results and our sensitivity to any material, adverse developments experienced
by our significant customers.

Our semiconductor customers are not generally required to purchase specific
quantities of products. Even when customers agree to source an agreed portion
of their product needs from us, such arrangements often include pricing
schedules or methodologies that apply regardless of the volume of products
purchased, and those customers may not purchase the amount of product we
expect. As a result, we may not generate the amount of revenue or achieve the
level of profitability we expect under such arrangements. Moreover, our top
customers' purchasing power has, in some cases, given them the ability to make
greater demands on us with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general.
We expect this trend to continue, which may adversely affect our gross margin
on certain products and, should we fail to perform under these arrangements,
we could also be liable for significant monetary damages.

The loss of, or any substantial reduction in sales to, any of our top
customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Dependence on contract manufacturing and suppliers of critical components
within our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to
market, damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations.

We operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that
principally utilizes CMs, such as third-party wafer foundries and module
assembly and test capabilities. Our semiconductor products require wafer
manufacturers with state-of-the-art fabrication equipment and techniques, and
most of our products are designed to be manufactured in a specific process,
typically at one particular fab or foundry, either our own or with a
particular CM.

We depend on our CMs to allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our
needs, to produce products of acceptable quality at acceptable yields, and to
deliver those products to us on a timely basis. We do not generally have long-
term capacity commitments with our CMs and substantially all of our
manufacturing services are on a purchase order basis with no minimum
quantities. Further, our CMs may fail to timely develop new, advanced
manufacturing processes, including transitions to smaller geometry process
technologies or, from time to time, will cease to, or will become unable to,
manufacture a component for us. As lead times to identify, qualify and
establish reliable production at acceptable yields with a new CM is typically
lengthy, there is often no readily available alternative source and there may
be other constraints on our ability to change CMs. In addition, qualifying new
CMs is often expensive, and they may not produce products as cost-effectively
as our current suppliers.

TSMC, one of our CMs, manufactured approximately 90% of the wafers
manufactured by our CMs during fiscal year 2022. We believe our wafer
requirements represent a meaningful portion of TSMC's total production
capacity. However, TSMC also fabricates wafers for other companies, including
some of our competitors, and could choose or be required to prioritize
capacity for other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short
notice. In addition, TSMC has, and may in the future, raise their prices to
us.

If any of the foregoing circumstances occur, we may be unable to meet our
customer demand, or to the same extent as our competitors, fail to meet our
contractual obligations or forgo revenue opportunities. This has in the past
damaged, and may in the future damage our relationships with our customers.
This could also result in litigation for alleged failure to meet our
obligations, payment of significant damages, and our net revenue could
decline, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, results of
operations and gross margin.

Further, any substantial disruption in the contract manufacturing services
that we utilize, including TSMC's supply of wafers to us, as a result of a
natural disaster, climate change, water shortages, political unrest, military
conflicts, geopolitical turmoil, trade tensions, government orders, medical
epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, economic instability, equipment
failure or other cause, could materially harm our business, customer
relationships and results of operations.

We purchase a significant amount of the materials used in our products from a
limited number of suppliers.

Our manufacturing processes and those of our CMs rely on many materials,
including silicon, GaAs and InP wafers, copper lead frames, precious and rare
earth metals, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases.
During fiscal year 2022, we purchased approximately two-thirds of our
manufacturing materials from five materials providers, some of which are
single source suppliers. As certain materials are highly specialized, the lead
time needed to identify and qualify a new supplier is typically lengthy and
there is often no readily available alternative source. We do not generally
have long-term contracts with our materials providers and substantially all of
our purchases are on a purchase order basis. Suppliers may extend lead times,
limit supplies, place products on allocation or increase prices due to
commodity price increases, capacity constraints, inflation, or other factors,
any of which could lead to interruption of supply or increased demand in the
industry. For example, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced some
supply constraints and increases in prices, including with respect to wafers
and substrates. Additionally, the supply of these materials may be negatively
impacted by increased trade tensions between the U.S. and its trading
partners, particularly China. The supply constraints have had, and may
continue to have, a negative impact on our customer relationships. Further,
continued supply constraints for these or any other reasons could result in
loss of revenue opportunities and adversely impact our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Our business is subject to various governmental regulations, and compliance
with these regulations may cause us to incur significant expense. If we fail
to maintain compliance with applicable regulations, we may be forced to cease
the manufacture and distribution of certain products, and we could be subject
to administrative proceedings and civil or criminal penalties.

Our business is subject to various domestic and international laws and other
legal requirements, including anti-competition and import/export regulations,
such as the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, and applicable executive
orders. These laws, regulations and orders are complex, may change frequently
and with limited notice, and have generally and may continue to become more
stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply
with, or to remedy violations of, these regulations. In addition, if our
customers fail to comply with these regulations, we may be required to suspend
sales to these customers, which could damage our reputation and negatively
impact our results of operations. The U.S. government may also add companies
to its restricted entity list and/or technologies to its list of prohibited
exports to specific countries, which have had and will continue to have an
adverse effect on our ability to sell our products and our revenue. For
example, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., one of our customers, is subject to
certain U.S. export restrictions, which has required us to suspend sales to
Huawei until we obtain licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce. We may
be unable to obtain or maintain the necessary licenses to allow us to export
products to them. These restrictive governmental actions and any similar
measures that may be imposed on U.S. companies by other governments,
especially in light of ongoing trade tensions with China, will likely limit or
prevent us from doing business with certain of our customers or suppliers and
harm our ability to compete effectively or otherwise negatively affect our
ability to sell our products, and adversely affect our business and results of
operations.

Our products and operations are also subject to regulation by U.S. and
non-U.S. regulatory agencies, such as the FTC. From time to time, we may also
be involved or required to participate in regulatory investigations or
inquiries, such as the ongoing investigation by the Korean Fair Trade
Commission into certain of our contracting and business practices, which may
evolve into legal or other administrative proceedings. Growing public concern
over concentration of economic power in corporations is likely to result in
increased anti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative rule
making, and enforcement activity. Involvement in regulatory investigations or
inquiries, can be costly, lengthy, complex and time consuming, diverting the
attention and energies of our management and technical personnel.

16

Table of Contents

If any pending or future governmental investigations result in an unfavorable
resolution, we could be required to cease the manufacture and sale of the
subject products or technology, pay fines or disgorge profits or other
payments, and/or cease certain conduct and/or modify our contracting or
business practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be obligated
to indemnify our current or former directors or employees, or former directors
or employees of companies that we have acquired, in connection with regulatory
investigations. These liabilities could be substantial and may include, among
other things, the cost of government, law enforcement or regulatory
investigations and civil or criminal fines and penalties.

In addition, the manufacture and distribution of our semiconductors must
comply with various laws and adapt to changes in regulatory requirements as
they occur. For example, if a country in which our products are manufactured
or sold sets technical standards that are not widely shared, it may require us
to stop distributing our products commercially until they comply with such new
standards, lead certain of our customers to suspend imports of their products
into that country, require manufacturers in that country to manufacture
products with different technical standards and disrupt cross-border
manufacturing relationships, any of which could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to
comply with these requirements, we could also be required to pay civil
penalties or face criminal prosecution.

Global political and economic conditions and other factors related to our
international operations could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

A majority of our products are produced, sourced and sold internationally and
our international revenue represents a significant percentage of our overall
revenue. In addition, as of October 30, 2022, nearly 49% of our employees were
located outside the U.S. Multiple factors relating to our international
operations and to particular countries in which we operate could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. These factors include:

•changes in political, regulatory, legal or economic conditions or
geopolitical turmoil (including China-Taiwan relations), including terrorism,
war or political or military coups, state-sponsored or politically motivated
cyber-attacks, or civil disturbances or political instability foreign and
domestic;

•restrictive governmental actions, such as restrictions on the transfer or
repatriation of funds and foreign investments, data privacy regulations,
imposition of climate change regulations, and trade protection measures,
including increasing protectionism, import/export restrictions (including with
regards to advanced technologies), import/export duties and quotas, trade
sanctions and customs duties and tariffs, all of which have increased in
recent years;

•difficulty in obtaining product distribution and support, and transportation
delays;

•potential inability to localize software products;

•difficulty in conducting due diligence with respect to business partners;

•public health or safety concerns, medical epidemics or pandemics, such as
COVID-19, and other natural- or man-made disasters;

•nationalization of businesses and expropriation of assets; and

•changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws.

A significant legal risk associated with conducting business internationally
is compliance with the various and differing laws and regulations of the many
countries in which we do business. In addition, the laws in various countries
are constantly evolving and may, in some cases, conflict with each other.
Although our policies prohibit us, our employees and our agents from engaging
in unethical business practices, there can be no assurance that all of our
employees, distributors or other agents will refrain from acting in violation
of our related anti-corruption or other policies and procedures. Any such
violation could have a material adverse effect on our business.

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted normal business activity, which has
impacted how we operate our business.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts to control it disrupted, and reduced the
efficiency of, normal business activities in much of the world. We experienced
some disruption to parts of our global semiconductor supply chain, including
procuring necessary components and inputs, such as wafers and substrates, in a
timely fashion, with suppliers increasing lead times or placing products on
allocation. As a result of these supply chain disruptions, we increased
customer order lead times and placed some products on allocation. We are also
largely building semiconductor products to order and this has limited and may
continue to limit our ability to fulfill orders and satisfy all of the demand
for our products.

The pandemic resulted in authorities around the world implementing numerous
unprecedented measures, such as travel restrictions quarantines, shelter-in-
place order, and factory and office shutdowns, that impacted our workforce and

17

Table of Contents

operations, and those of our customers, CMs, suppliers and logistics
providers. In addition, disruptions to commercial transportation
infrastructure impacted delivery times for materials and components to our
facilities, transfers of our products to our key suppliers and, in some cases,
our ability to timely ship our products to customers. This resulted in
significant logistical challenges and product delays, which could recur in the
event of any future closures of, or periods of reduced operations at, our
warehouse or the facilities of our suppliers and providers.

In response to the pandemic, we have taken extensive measures to protect the
health and safety of our employees and contractors at our facilities. However,
existing or new precautionary measures or modifications in our business
practices and policies, may negatively impact our business or operations,
especially if the spread of COVID-19 (including any variants) worsens
significantly. In addition, any actions we take may not be sufficient to
mitigate the risk of infection and could result in a significant number of
COVID-19-related claims. If a significant number of our employees, or
employees and third parties performing key functions, including our Chief
Executive Officer and members of our Board of Directors, become ill, our
business may be further adversely impacted. In addition, changes to state
workers' compensation laws, such as those in California, may increase our
potential liability for such claims. See also our risk factor "If we are
unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, especially our engineering
and technical personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy
effectively."

The degree to which the pandemic ultimately impacts our business and results
of operations will depend on future developments beyond our control, including
the extent of actions to contain the virus (including any variants),
availability and efficacy of the vaccines or other treatments, public
acceptance of the vaccines (including boosters), and to what extent normal
economic and operating conditions resume.

We are subject to risks associated with our distributors and other channel
partners, including product inventory levels and product sell-through.

We sell our products through a direct sales force and a select network of
distributors and other channel partners globally. Sales to distributors
accounted for 56% of our net revenue in the fiscal year ended October 30, 2022
and are subject to a number of risks, including:

•fluctuations in demand based on our distributors' product inventory levels
and end customer demand;

•our distributors and other channel partners are generally not subject to
minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their
customers;

•our distributors and other channel partners agreements are generally
nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause;

•our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products to end
customers; and

•our distributors and other channel partners may market and distribute
competing products and may place greater emphasis on the sale of these
products.

In addition, we are selling our semiconductor products through an increasingly
limited number of distributors, which exposes us to additional customer
concentration and related credit risks.

We do not always have a direct relationship with the end customers of our
products. As a result, our semiconductor products may be used in applications
for which they were not necessarily designed or tested, including, for
example, medical devices, and they may not perform as anticipated in such
applications. In such event, failure of even a small number of parts could
result in significant liabilities to us, damage our reputation and harm our
business and results of operations.

Our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members
of our senior management team.

Our success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our
senior management team, and in particular, the services of Hock E. Tan, our
President and Chief Executive Officer. Effective succession planning is also
important for our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfers of
knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management could hinder our
strategic planning and execution. None of our senior management is bound by
written employment contracts. In addition, we do not currently maintain key
person life insurance covering our senior management. The loss of any of our
senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy
and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate.

If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, especially our
engineering and technical personnel, we may not be able to execute our
business strategy effectively.

Our future success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate
qualified personnel. As the source of our technological and product
innovations, our engineering and technical personnel (including cyber security
experts) are a significant asset. Competition for these employees is
significant in many areas of the world in which we operate, particularly

18

* * *

Table of Contents

in Silicon Valley and Southeast Asia where qualified engineers are in high
demand. In addition, current or future immigration laws may make it more
difficult to hire or retain qualified engineers, further limiting the pool of
available talent. We believe equity awards provide a powerful long-term
retention incentive and have historically granted these awards to the
substantial majority of our employees. However, the amendments to our 2012
Stock Incentive Plan approved by our stockholders in 2021 significantly
reduced the number of shares available for equity awards. As a result, we may
need to change our current equity granting philosophy, which could impair our
efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel. Any inability to retain,
attract or motivate such personnel and provide competitive employment benefits
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

The failure to complete our acquisition of VMware, Inc. may adversely affect
our business and our stock price.

Consummation of the VMware Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
customary closing conditions, including (i) the expiration or termination of
the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of
1976 and clearance under the antitrust laws of the European Union and certain
other jurisdictions, (ii) the receipt by VMware of a tax opinion regarding the
U.S. federal income tax treatment of certain aspects of the VMware Merger,
(iii) the absence of certain orders or laws preventing consummation of the
VMware Merger, (iv) authorization for listing additional shares of Broadcom
common stock on Nasdaq, and (v) the absence of a material adverse effect with
respect to either us or VMware. There can be no assurance that these or other
closing conditions will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all. Any delay
in completing the acquisition could cause us not to realize some or all of the
anticipated benefits when expected, if at all. If the VMware Merger is not
completed, our stock price could decline to the extent it reflects an
assumption that we will complete the acquisition. Furthermore, if the VMware
Merger is not completed, we may suffer other consequences that could adversely
affect our business, results of operations and stock price, including
incurring significant acquisition costs that we would be unable to recover,
negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment
community. Additionally, under certain specified circumstances, including the
termination by either us or VMware because certain required regulatory
clearances are not obtained, upon termination we would be required to pay
VMware a termination fee of $1.5 billion.

Failure to realize the benefits expected from the VMware Merger could
adversely affect the value of our common stock.

Although we expect significant benefits to result from the VMware Merger,
there can be no assurance that we will actually realize any of them, or
realize them within the anticipated timeframe. Achieving these benefits will
depend, in part, on our ability to integrate VMware's business successfully
and efficiently. The challenges involved in this integration, which will be
complex and time consuming, include the following:

•preserving customer and other important relationships of VMware and
attracting new business and operational relationships;

•integrating financial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting
cycles;

•consolidating and integrating corporate, information technology, finance and
administrative infrastructures;

•coordinating sales and marketing efforts to effectively position our
capabilities;

•coordinating and integrating operations in countries in which we have not
previously operated; and

•integrating employees and related HR systems and benefits, maintaining
employee morale and retaining key employees.

If we do not successfully manage these issues and the other challenges
inherent in integrating an acquired business, then we may not achieve the
anticipated benefits of the VMware Merger on our anticipated timeframe or at
all and our revenue, expenses, operating results, financial condition and
stock price could be materially adversely affected. The successful integration
of the VMware business will require significant management attention both
before and after the completion of the VMware Merger, and may divert the
attention of management from our business and operational issues.

We may pursue acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and dispositions,
which could adversely affect our results of operations.

Our growth strategy includes acquiring or investing in businesses that offer
complementary products, services and technologies, or enhance our market
coverage or technological capabilities.

Any acquisitions we may undertake, including the VMware Merger, and their
integration involve risks and uncertainties, such as:

•unexpected delays, challenges and related expenses, and disruption of our
business;

•diversion of management's attention from daily operations and the pursuit of
other opportunities;

19

* * *

Table of Contents

•incurring significant restructuring charges and amortization expense,
assuming liabilities (some of which may be unexpected) and ongoing or new
lawsuits, potential impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible
assets, and increasing our expenses and working capital requirements;

•the potential for deficiencies in internal controls at the acquired business,
as well as implementing our own management information systems, operating
systems and internal controls for the acquired operations;

•our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with the
acquired business' products, financial disclosures, accounting practices,
legal, tax and other contingencies, compliance with local laws and regulations
(and interpretations thereof) in the U.S. and multiple international
jurisdictions;

•additional acquisition-related debt, which could increase our leverage and
potentially negatively affect our credit ratings resulting in more restrictive
borrowing terms or increased borrowing costs thereby limiting our ability to
borrow;

•dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders;

•difficulties integrating the acquired business or company and in managing and
retaining acquired employees, vendors and customers; and

•inaccuracies in our original estimates and assumptions used to assess a
transaction, which may result in us not realizing the expected financial or
strategic benefits of any such transaction.

In addition, current and future changes to the U.S. and foreign regulatory
approval process and requirements related to acquisitions, including the
VMware Merger, may cause approvals to take longer than anticipated, not be
forthcoming or contain burdensome conditions, which may prevent the
transaction or jeopardize, delay or reduce the anticipated benefits of the
transaction, and impede the execution of our business strategy.

From time to time, we may also seek to divest or wind down portions of our
business, either acquired or otherwise, or we may exit minority investments,
any of which could materially affect our cash flows and results of operations.
Such dispositions involve risks and uncertainties, including our ability to
sell such businesses on terms acceptable to us, or at all, disruption to other
parts of our business, potential loss of employees or customers, or exposure
to unanticipated liabilities or ongoing obligations to us following any such
dispositions. In addition, dispositions may include the transfer of technology
and/or the licensing of certain IP rights to third-party purchasers, which
could limit our ability to utilize such IP rights or assert these rights
against such third-party purchasers or other third parties.

We may be involved in legal proceedings, including IP, securities litigation,
and employee-related claims, which could, among other things, divert efforts
of management and result in significant expense and loss of our IP rights.

We are often involved in legal proceedings, including cases involving our IP
rights and those of others, commercial matters, acquisition-related suits,
securities class action suits, employee-related claims and other actions.
Litigation or settlement of such actions, regardless of their merit, can be
costly, lengthy, complex and time consuming, diverting the attention and
energies of our management and technical personnel.

The industries in which we operate are characterized by companies holding
large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by the
vigorous pursuit, protection and enforcement of IP rights, including actions
by patent-holding companies that do not make or sell products. From time to
time, third parties assert against us and our customers and distributors their
IP rights to technologies that are important to our business. For example, in
August 2020 judgment was entered against Broadcom and Apple for infringement
of certain patents and California Institute of Technology was awarded past
damages of $270.2 million from Broadcom and $837.8 million from Apple, for
which Apple is seeking indemnification from Broadcom. Although the appellate
court recently vacated these damages and ordered a new trial, there are no
assurances that we will be successful or what, if any, damages we will be
required to pay.

Many of our customer agreements, and in some cases our asset sale agreements,
and/or the laws of certain jurisdictions may require us to indemnify our
customers or purchasers for third-party IP infringement claims, including
costs to defend those claims, and payment of damages in the case of adverse
rulings. However, our CMs and suppliers may or may not be required to
indemnify us should we or our customers be subject to such third-party claims.
Claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and
might deter future customers from doing business with us. If any pending or
future proceedings result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to:

•cease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products, processes or
technology and/or make changes to our processes or products;

•pay substantial damages for past, present and future use of the infringing
technology, including up to treble damages if willful infringement is found;

20

* * *

Table of Contents

•expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology;

•license technology from the third-party claiming infringement, which license
may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all;

•enter into cross-licenses with our competitors, which could weaken our
overall IP portfolio and our ability to compete in particular product
categories;

•pay substantial damages to our direct or end customers to discontinue use or
replace infringing technology with non-infringing technology; or

•relinquish IP rights associated with one or more of our patent claims.

Any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, we may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors
or employees, or former directors or employees of companies that we have
acquired, in connection with such litigation. These liabilities could be
substantial and may include, among other things, the cost of defending
lawsuits against these individuals, as well as stockholder derivative suits;
civil or criminal fines and penalties; legal and other expenses; and expenses
associated with the remedial measure, if any, which may be imposed.

Our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual
fluctuations.

Our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate
in the future. These fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and annual basis
and are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. In
addition to many of the risks described elsewhere in this "Risk Factors"
section, these factors include, among others:

•the timing of launches by our customers of new product in which our products
are included and changes in end-user demand for our customers' the products;

•fluctuations in the levels of component or product inventories held by our
customers;

•the shift to cloud-based IT solutions and services, such as hyperscale
computing, which may adversely affect the timing and volume of sales of our
products for use in traditional enterprise data centers;

•the timing of new software contracts and renewals, as well as the timing of
any terminations of software contracts that require us to refund to customers
any pre-paid amounts under the contract;

•our ability to timely develop, introduce and market new products and
technologies;

•the timing and extent of our software license and subscription revenue, and
other non-product revenue;

•new product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors;

•seasonality or other fluctuations in demand in our markets;

•timing and amount of research and development and related new product
expenditures, and the timing of receipt of any research and development grant
monies; and

•timing of any regulatory changes, particularly with respect to trade
sanctions and customs duties and tariffs, and tax reform.

The foregoing factors are often difficult to predict, and these, as well as
other factors, could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual
operating results. In addition, a significant amount of our operating expenses
are relatively fixed in nature. Any failure to adjust spending quickly enough
to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such
revenue shortfall on our results of operations. As a result, we believe that
quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be
meaningful or a reliable indicator of our future performance. If our operating
results in one or more future quarters fail to meet the expectations of
securities analysts or investors, a significant decline in the trading price
of our common stock may occur, which may happen immediately or over time.

Failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet
customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations.

We make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business
that we will seek and accept, production schedules, levels of reliance on
contract manufacturing and outsourcing, internal fabrication utilization and
other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customer requirements,
which may not be accurate.

21

Table of Contents

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have moved largely to a build to order model
and have extended customer lead times substantially in light of supply chain
challenges. More typically, however, to ensure the availability of our
semiconductor products we start manufacturing based on customer forecasts,
which are not binding. As a result, we incur inventory and manufacturing costs
in advance of anticipated sales that may be substantially lower than expected.
If actual demand for our products is lower than forecast, we may also
experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and product
obsolescence. Because certain of our sales, research and development, and
internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in
customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income.

Conversely, customers often require rapid increases in production on short
notice. If we are unable to meet such increases in demand, this could damage
our customer relationships, reduce revenue growth and margins, subject us to
additional liabilities, harm our reputation, and prevent us from taking
advantage of opportunities.

Winning business in the semiconductor solutions industry is subject to a
lengthy process that often requires us to incur significant expense, from
which we may ultimately generate no revenue.

Our semiconductor business is dependent on us winning competitive bid
selection processes, known as "design wins". These selection processes are
typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate significant development
expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer
opportunity. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from
obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This
can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future selection
processes.

Winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer. A delay or
cancellation of a customer's plans could materially and adversely affect our
financial results, as we incur significant expense in the design process and
may generate little or no revenue from it. In addition, the timing of design
wins is unpredictable and implementing production for a major design win, or
multiple design wins at the same time, may strain our resources and those of
our CMs. In such event, we may be forced to dedicate significant additional
resources and incur additional costs and expenses. Further, often customers
will only purchase limited numbers of evaluation units until they qualify the
products and/or the manufacturing line for those products. The qualification
process can take significant time and resources. Delays in qualification or
failure to qualify our products may cause a customer to discontinue use of our
products and result in a significant loss of revenue. Finally, customers could
choose at any time to stop using our products or could fail to successfully
market and sell their products, which could reduce demand for our products,
and cause us to hold excess inventory, materially adversely affecting our
business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are
exacerbated by the fact that many of our products, and the end products into
which our products are incorporated, often have very short life cycles.

Competition in our industries could prevent us from growing our revenue.

The industries in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by
rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, changes in customer
requirements, often aggressive pricing practices and, in some cases, new
delivery methods. We expect competition in these industries to continue to
increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings or
as new competitors enter our markets.

Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name
recognition, a larger installed customer base, larger technical staffs, more
established relationships with vendors or suppliers, or greater manufacturing,
distribution, financial, research and development, technical and marketing
resources than us. We also face competition from numerous smaller companies
that specialize in specific aspects of the highly fragmented software
industry, open source authors who provide software and IP for free,
competitors who offer their products through try-and-buy or freemium models,
and customers who develop competing products.

In addition, the trend toward consolidation is changing the competitive
landscape. We expect this trend to continue, which may result in combined
competitors having greater resources than us. Some of our competitors may also
receive financial and other support from their home country government or may
have a greater presence in key markets, a larger customer base, a more
comprehensive IP portfolio or better patent protection than us.

The actions of our competitors, in the areas of pricing and product bundling
in particular, could have a substantial adverse impact on us. Further,
competitors may leverage their superior market position, as well as IP or
other proprietary information, including interface, interoperability or
technical information, in new and emerging technologies and platforms that may
inhibit our ability to compete effectively. If we are unable to compete
successfully, we may lose market share for our products or incur significant
reduction in our gross margins, either of which could have a material adverse
effect on our business and results of operations.

A prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facilities, research and
development facilities, warehouses or other significant operations, or those
of our suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Although we operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model, we
also rely on our own manufacturing facilities, in particular in Fort Collins,
Colorado, Singapore, and Breinigsville, Pennsylvania. We use these internal
fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative and proprietary
processes. Our Fort Collins and Breinigsville facilities are the sole sources
for the FBAR components used in many of our wireless devices and for the
indium phosphide-based wafers used in our fibre optics products, respectively.
Many of our facilities, and those of our CMs and suppliers, are located in
California and the Pacific Rim region, which have above average seismic
activity and severe weather activity. In addition, a significant majority of
our research and development personnel are located the Czech Republic, India,
Israel and the U.S., with the expertise of the personnel at each such location
tending to be focused on one or two specific areas, and our primary warehouse
is in Malaysia.

A prolonged disruption at or shut-down of one or more of our manufacturing
facilities or warehouses, especially our Colorado, Singapore, Malaysia and
Pennsylvania facilities, or those of our CMs or suppliers, due to natural- or
man-made disasters or other events outside of our control, such as equipment
malfunction or widespread outbreaks of acute illness, including COVID-19, or
for any other reason, would limit our capacity to meet customer demands and
delay new product development until a replacement facility and equipment, if
necessary, were found. To date, we have not experienced a material event,
however such event could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments
and revenue, result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand,
expose us to claims by our customers, result in significant expense to repair
or replace our affected facilities, and, in some instances, could
significantly curtail our research and development efforts in a particular
product area or target market. As a result, we could forgo revenue
opportunities, potentially lose market share, damage our customer
relationships and be subject to litigation and additional liabilities, all of
which could materially and adversely affect our business. Although we purchase
insurance to mitigate certain losses, such insurance often carries a high
deductible amount and any uninsured losses could negatively affect our
operating results. In addition, even if we were able to promptly resume
production of our affected products, if our customers cannot timely resume
their own manufacturing following such an event, they may cancel or scale back
their orders from us and this may in turn adversely affect our results of
operations. Such events could also result in increased fixed costs relative to
the revenue we generate and adversely affect our results of operations.

We may be unable to maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity or product
yields at our own manufacturing facilities, which could adversely affect our
relationships with our customers, and our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

We must maintain appropriate capacity and product yields at our own
manufacturing facilities to meet anticipated customer demand. From time to
time, this requires us to invest in expansion or improvements of those
facilities, which often involves substantial cost and other risks. Such
expanded manufacturing capacity may still be insufficient, or may not come
online soon enough, to meet customer demand and we may have to put customers
on product allocation, forgo sales or lose customers as a result. Conversely,
if we overestimate customer demand, we would experience excess capacity and
fixed costs at these facilities will not be fully absorbed, all of which could
adversely affect our results of operations. Similarly, reduced product yields,
due to design or manufacturing issues or otherwise, may involve significant
time and cost to remedy and cause delays in our ability to supply product to
our customers, all of which could cause us to forgo sales, incur liabilities
or lose customers, and harm our results of operations.

An impairment of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our IT
systems, or those of one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendors could
have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our business depends on various internally managed IT systems and outsourced
IT services, including cloud-based and other critical corporate infrastructure
services relating to, among other things, financial reporting, product orders
and shipping, human resources, benefit plan administration, IT network
development, network monitoring and electronic communication services, as well
as third-party data centers. Any failure of these internal or third-party
systems and services to operate effectively could disrupt our operations and
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to
protect our IT infrastructure against damage from business continuity events
that could have a significant disruptive effect. Although these systems are
designed to protect and secure our customers', suppliers' and employees'
confidential information, as well as our own proprietary information, we are,
out of necessity, dependent on our vendors to adequately address cyber
security threats to their own systems. In addition, software products we use
(including technologies produced by us) have occasionally had in the past and
may have in the future, vulnerabilities that, if left unmanaged, could reduce
the overall level of security of the systems on which the software is
installed.

Cyber-attacks are increasing in number and sophistication, are well-financed,
in some cases supported by state actors, and are designed to not only attack,
but also to evade detection. Since the techniques used to obtain unauthorized
access to systems, or to otherwise sabotage them, change frequently and are
often not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to
anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
Geopolitical instability, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, may increase
the likelihood that we will experience direct or collateral consequences from
cyber conflicts between nation-states or other politically motivated actors
targeting critical technology infrastructure. Accidental or willful security
breaches or other unauthorized access to our information systems or the
systems of our service providers, or the existence of computer viruses or
malware (such as ransomware) in our or their data or software could expose us
to a risk of information loss, business disruption, and misappropriation of
proprietary and confidential information, including information relating to
our products or customers and the personal information of our employees or
third parties. Such an event could disrupt our business and result in, among
other things, unfavorable publicity, damage to our reputation, loss of our
trade secrets and other competitive information, litigation by affected
parties and possible financial obligations for liabilities and damages related
to the theft or misuse of such information, significant remediation costs,
disruption of key business operations and significant diversion of our
resources, as well as fines and other sanctions resulting from any related
breaches of data privacy regulations (such as the General Data Protection
Regulation), any of which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, profitability and financial condition. While we may be entitled to
damages if our vendors fail to perform under their agreements with us, any
award may be insufficient to cover the actual costs incurred by us and, as a
result of a vendor's failure to perform, we may be unable to collect any
damages.

Despite our internal controls and investment in security measures, we have,
from time to time, been subject to disruptive cyber-attacks or there have been
attempts of unauthorized network intrusions and malware on our own IT
networks. Although no such cyber security incidents have been material to
Broadcom, we continue to devote resources to protect our systems and data from
unauthorized access or misuse, and we may be required to expend greater
resources in the future.

U.S. and foreign regulators have also increased their focus on cyber security
vulnerabilities and risks. Compliance with laws and regulations concerning
privacy, cyber security, data governance, and data protection could result in
significant expense, and any failure to comply could result in proceedings
against us by regulatory authorities or other third parties. Further,
customers and service providers increasingly demand rigorous contractual,
certification and audit provisions regarding privacy, cyber security, data
governance, data protection, confidentiality, and IP, which may also increase
our overall compliance burden.

Our gross margin is dependent on a number of factors, including our product
mix, price erosion, acquisitions we may make, level of capacity utilization
and commodity prices.

Our gross margin is highly dependent on product mix, which is susceptible to
seasonal and other fluctuations in our markets. A shift in sales mix away from
our higher margin products, as well as the timing and amount of our software
licensing and non-product revenue, could adversely affect our future gross
margin percentages. In addition, increased competition and the existence of
product alternatives, more complex engineering requirements, lower demand,
industry oversupply or reductions in our technological lead compared to our
competitors, and other factors have in the past and may in the future lead to
further price erosion, lower revenue and lower margin. Conversely, periods of
robust demand that create a supply imbalance, as we have seen recently, can
lead to higher gross margins that may not be sustainable over the longer term.

In addition, semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital
investment, leading to high fixed costs, including depreciation expense. If we
are unable to utilize our owned manufacturing facilities at a high level, the
fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed,
resulting in higher average unit costs and a lower gross margin. Furthermore,
we do not hedge our exposure to commodity prices, some of which are very
volatile, and sudden or prolonged increases in commodities prices may
adversely affect our gross margin.

Our gross margin may also be adversely affected if businesses or companies
that we acquire have different gross margin profiles and by expenses related
to such acquisitions.

We utilize a significant amount of IP in our business. If we are unable or
fail to protect our IP, our business could be adversely affected.

Our success depends in part upon protecting our IP. To accomplish this, we
rely on a combination of IP rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks
and trade secrets, as well as customary contractual protections with our
customers, suppliers, employees and consultants. We spend significant
resources to monitor and protect our IP rights, including the unauthorized use
of our products, usage rates of the software seat licenses and subscriptions
that we sell, and even with significant expenditures, we may not be able to
protect the IP rights that are valuable to our business. We are unable to
predict or assure that:

•our IP rights will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, or,
in the case of third-party IP rights licensed to us, be licensed to others;

24

* * *

Table of Contents

•our IP rights will provide competitive advantages to us;

•rights previously granted by third parties to IP licensed or assigned to us,
including portfolio cross-licenses, will not hamper our ability to assert our
IP rights or hinder the settlement of currently pending or future disputes;

•any of our pending or future patent, trademark or copyright applications will
be issued or have the coverage originally sought;

•our IP rights will be enforced in certain jurisdictions where competition is
intense or where legal protection may be weak; or

•we have sufficient IP rights to protect our products or our business.

Effective IP protection may be unavailable or more limited in other
jurisdictions, relative to those protections available in the U.S., and may
not be applied for or may be abandoned in one or more relevant jurisdictions.
In addition, when patents expire, we lose the protection and competitive
advantages they provided to us.

We also generate revenue from licensing royalty payments and from technology
claim settlements relating to certain of our IP. Licensing of our IP rights,
particularly exclusive licenses, may limit our ability to assert those IP
rights against third parties, including the licensee of those rights. In
addition, we may acquire companies with IP that is subject to licensing
obligations to other third parties. These licensing obligations may extend to
our own IP following any such acquisition and may limit our ability to assert
our IP rights. From time to time, we pursue litigation to assert our IP
rights, including, in some cases, against our customers and suppliers. Claims
of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might
deter future customers from doing business with us. Conversely, third parties
have and may in the future pursue IP litigation against us, including as a
result of our IP licensing business. An adverse decision in such types of
legal action could limit our ability to assert our IP rights and limit the
value of our technology, including the loss of opportunities to sell or
license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments, which could
otherwise negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

From time to time, we may need to obtain additional IP licenses or renew
existing license agreements. We are unable to predict whether these license
agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms or at all.

If our software products do not remain compatible with ever-changing operating
environments, platforms, or third-party products, demand for our products and
services could decrease, which could materially adversely affect our business.

We may be required to make substantial modification of our products to
maintain compatibility with operating systems, systems software and computer
hardware used by our customers or to provide our customers with desired
features or capabilities. We must also continually address the challenges of
dynamic and accelerating market trends and competitive developments, such as
the emergence of advanced persistent threats in the security space to compete
effectively. There can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt our
products in response to these developments.

Further, our software solutions interact with a variety of software and
hardware developed by third parties. If we lose access to third-party code and
specifications for the development of code, this could negatively impact our
ability to develop compatible software. In addition, if software providers and
hardware manufacturers, including some of our largest vendors, adopt new
policies restricting the use or availability of their code or technical
documentation for their operating systems, applications, or hardware, or
otherwise impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access, this could
result in higher research and development costs for the enhancement and
modification of our existing products or development of new products. Any
additional restrictions could materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition and operating results and cash flow.

Failure to enter into software license agreements on a satisfactory basis
could materially adversely affect our business.

Many of our existing customers have multi-year enterprise software license
agreements, some of which involve substantial aggregate fee amounts. Customer
renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors,
including the level of customer satisfaction with our solutions or customer
support, customer budgets and the pricing of our solutions as compared with
the solutions offered by our competitors, any of which may cause our revenue
to grow more slowly than expected, if at all. The failure to renew customer
agreements of similar scope, on terms that are commercially attractive to us,
could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and
operating results and cash flow.

Certain software that we use in our products is licensed from third parties
and may not be available to us in the future, which may delay product
development and production or cause us to incur additional expense.

Some of our solutions contain software licensed from third parties, some of
which may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to
us or allow our products to remain competitive. The loss of these licenses or
the inability to

25

Table of Contents

maintain any of them on commercially acceptable terms could delay development
of future products or the enhancement of existing products.

Certain software we use is from open source code sources, which, under certain
circumstances could materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition, operating results and cash flow.

Some of our products contain software from open source code sources, the use
of which may subject us to certain conditions, including the obligation to
offer such products for no cost or to make the proprietary source code of
those products publicly available. Further, although some open source vendors
provide warranty and support agreements, it is common for such software to be
available "as-is" with no warranty, indemnity or support. Although we monitor
our use of such open source code to avoid subjecting our products to
unintended conditions, such use, under certain circumstances, could materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and
cash flow, including if we are required to take remedial action that may
divert resources away from our development efforts.

Failure of our software products to manage and secure IT infrastructures and
environments could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Certain aspects of our software products are intended to manage and secure IT
infrastructures and environments, and as a result, we expect these products to
be ongoing targets of cyber security attacks. Open source code or other third-
party software used in these products could also be targeted. Although we
continually seek to improve our countermeasures to prevent such incidents, we
may be unable to anticipate every scenario and it is possible that certain
cyber threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to
prevent an attack or an accidental incident on us and our customers.
Additionally, efforts by malicious cyber actors or others could cause
interruptions, delays or cessation of our product licensing, or modification
of our software, which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers.
A successful cyber security attack involving our products could cause
customers and potential customers to believe our services are ineffective or
unreliable and result in, among other things, the loss of customers,
unfavorable publicity, damage to our reputation, difficulty in marketing our
products, allegations by our customers that we have not performed our
contractual obligations and give rise to significant costs, including costs
related to developing solutions or indemnification obligations under our
agreements. Any such event could adversely impact our revenue and results of
operations. See also "An impairment of the confidentiality, integrity, or
availability of our IT systems, or those of one or more of our corporate
infrastructure vendors, could have a material adverse effect on our business".

We are subject to warranty claims, product recalls and product liability.

From time to time, we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims
that may lead to significant expense. Our customer contracts typically contain
warranty and indemnification provisions, and in certain cases may also contain
liquidated damages provisions, relating to product quality issues. The
potential liabilities associated with such provisions are significant, and in
some cases, including in agreements with some of our largest customers, are
potentially unlimited. Any such liabilities may greatly exceed any revenue we
receive from the relevant products. Costs, payments or damages incurred or
paid by us in connection with warranty and product liability claims and
product recalls could materially adversely affect our financial condition and
results of operations. We may also be exposed to such claims as a result of
any acquisition we may undertake in the future.

Product liability insurance is subject to significant deductibles and there is
no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect
against all such claims, or we may elect to self-insure with respect to
certain matters. For example, it is possible for one of our customers to
recall a product containing one of our semiconductor devices. In such an
event, we may incur significant costs and expenses, including among others,
replacement costs, contract damage claims from our customers and reputational
harm. Although we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and
purchase product liability insurance, our reserves may be inadequate to cover
the uninsured portion of such claims. Conversely, in some cases, amounts we
reserve may ultimately exceed our actual liability for particular claims and
may need to be reversed.

The complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expense or
undetected defects or bugs, which could adversely affect the market acceptance
of new products, damage our reputation with current or prospective customers,
and materially and adversely affect our operating costs.

Highly complex products, such as those we offer, may contain defects and bugs
when they are first introduced or as new versions, software documentation or
enhancements are released, or their release may be delayed due to unforeseen
difficulties during product development. If any of our products or third-party
components used in our products, contain defects or bugs, or have reliability,
quality or compatibility problems, we may not be able to successfully design
workarounds. Furthermore, if any of these problems are not discovered until
after we have commenced commercial production or deployment of a new product,
we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall,
repair or replacement costs. Significant technical challenges also arise with
our software products because our customers license and deploy our products
across a variety of computer platforms and integrate them with a number of
third-party software

26

Table of Contents

applications and databases. As a result, if there is system-wide failure or an
actual or perceived breach of information integrity, security or availability
occurs in one of our end-user customer's system, it can be difficult to
determine which product is at fault and we could ultimately be harmed by the
failure of another supplier's product. Consequently, our reputation may be
damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products, which could
materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and
attract new customers. To resolve these problems, we may have to invest
significant capital and other resources and we would likely lose, or
experience a delay in, market acceptance of the affected product or products.
These problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or
others. For example, if a delay in the manufacture and delivery of our
products causes the delay of a customer's end-product delivery, we may be
required, under the terms of our agreement with that customer, to compensate
the customer for the adverse effects of such delays. As a result, our
financial results could be materially adversely affected.

We make substantial investments in research and development and unsuccessful
investments could materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

The industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological
change, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions
and enhancements, short product cycles and evolving industry standards, and
new delivery methods. In addition, semiconductor products transition over time
to increasingly smaller line width geometries and failure to successfully
transition to smaller geometry process technologies could impair our
competitive position. In order to remain competitive, we have made, and expect
to continue to make, significant investments in research and development. If
we fail to develop new and enhanced products and technologies, if we focus on
technologies that do not become widely adopted, or if new competitive
technologies that we do not support become widely accepted, demand for our
products may be reduced. Increased investments in research and development or
unsuccessful research and development efforts could cause our cost structure
to fall out of alignment with demand for our products, which would have a
negative impact on our financial results.

We collect, use, store, or otherwise process personal information, which
subjects us to privacy and data security laws and contractual commitments, and
our actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws and commitments could
harm our business.

We collect, use and store (collectively, "process") a high volume, variety and
velocity of certain personal information in connection with the operation of
our business. This creates various levels of privacy risks across different
parts of our business, depending on the type of personal information, the
jurisdiction in question and the purpose of their processing. The personal
information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal, state,
local, and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security,
as well as contractual commitments. Privacy legislation and other data
protection regulations, enforcement and policy activity in this area are
expanding rapidly in many jurisdictions and creating a complex regulatory
compliance environment. Sectoral legislation, certification requirements and
technical standards applying to certain categories of our customers, such as
those is the financial services or public sector, are likely to further
exacerbate this trend. The cost of complying with and implementing these
privacy-related and data governance measures could be significant as they may
create additional burdensome security, business process, business record or
data localization requirements. Concerns about government interference,
sovereignty, expanding privacy, cyber security and data governance legislation
could adversely affect our customers and our products and services,
particularly in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and our own data
management practices. The theft, loss or misuse of personal data collected,
used, stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in
significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to
defending legal claims. Any inadvertent failure or perceived failure by us to
comply with privacy, data governance or cyber security obligations may result
in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, substantial fines and
damages, and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have
an adverse effect on our reputation and business.

We are subject to environmental, health and safety laws, which could increase
our costs, restrict our operations and require expenditures that could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

We are subject to a variety of domestic and international laws and regulations
relating to the use, disposal, clean-up of and human exposure to hazardous
materials. Compliance with environmental, health and safety requirements
could, among other things, require us to modify our manufacturing processes,
restrict our ability to expand our facilities, or require us to acquire
pollution control equipment, all of which can be very costly. Any failure by
us to comply with such requirements could result in the limitation or
suspension of the manufacture of our products and could result in litigation
against us and the payment of significant fines and damages by us in the event
of a significant adverse judgment. In addition, complying with any cleanup or
remediation obligations for which we are or become responsible could be costly
and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Changing requirements relating to the materials composition of our
semiconductor products, including the restrictions on lead and certain other
substances in electronic products sold in various countries, including the
U.S., China and Japan, and in the European Union, increase the complexity and
costs of our product design and procurement operations and may require us to
re-engineer our products. Such re-engineering may result in excess inventory
or other additional costs and could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations. We may also experience claims from employees from time
to time with regard to exposure to hazardous materials or other workplace
related environmental claims.

Social and environmental regulations, policies and provisions, as well as
customer and investor demands, may make our supply chain more complex and may
adversely affect our relationships with customers and investors.

There is an increasing focus on corporate social and environmental
responsibility in the semiconductor industry, particularly with OEMs that
manufacture consumer electronics. A number of our customers have adopted, or
may adopt, procurement policies that include social and environmental
responsibility provisions or requirements that their suppliers should comply
with, or they may seek to include such provisions or requirements in their
procurement terms and conditions. An increasing number of investors are also
requiring companies to disclose corporate social and environmental policies,
practices and metrics.  In addition, various jurisdictions are developing
climate change-based laws or regulations that could cause us to incur
additional direct costs for compliance, as well as indirect costs resulting
from our customers, suppliers, or both incurring additional compliance costs
that are passed on to us. These legal and regulatory requirements, as well as
investor expectations, on corporate environmental and social responsibility
practices and disclosure, are subject to change, can be unpredictable, and may
be difficult and expensive for us to comply with, given the complexity of our
supply chain and our significant outsourced manufacturing. If we are unable to
comply, or are unable to cause our suppliers or CMs to comply, with such
policies or provisions or meet the requirements of our customers and
investors, a customer may stop purchasing products from us or an investor may
sell their shares, and may take legal action against us, which could harm our
reputation, revenue and results of operations.

In addition, as part of their corporate social and environmental
responsibility programs, an increasing number of OEMs are seeking to source
products that do not contain minerals sourced from areas where proceeds from
the sale of such minerals are likely to be used to fund armed conflicts, such
as in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This could adversely affect the
sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of
semiconductor devices, including our products. As a result, we may face
difficulties in satisfying these customers' demands, which may harm our sales
and operating results.

The average selling prices of semiconductor products in our markets have often
decreased rapidly and may do so in the future, which could harm our revenue
and gross profit.

The semiconductor products we develop and sell are used for high volume
applications. As a result, the prices of those products have often decreased
rapidly. Gross profit on our products may be negatively affected by, among
other things, pricing pressures from our customers. In the past, we have
reduced the average selling prices of our products in anticipation of future
competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by us or our
competitors and other factors. In addition, some of our customer agreements
provide for volume-based pricing and product pricing roadmaps, which can also
reduce the average selling prices of our products over time. Our margins and
financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our
average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes, reducing manufacturing
costs, or developing new and higher value-added products on a timely basis.

Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could result in losses.

We operate global businesses and our consolidated financial results are
reported in U.S. dollars. However, some of the revenue and expenses of our
foreign subsidiaries are denominated in local currencies. Fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates against the U.S. dollar could result in substantial
changes in reported revenues and operating results due to the foreign exchange
impact of translating these transactions into U.S. dollars.

In the normal course of business, we employ various hedging strategies to
partially mitigate these risks, including the use of derivative instruments.
These strategies may not be effective in protecting us against the effects of
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. As a result, fluctuations in foreign
exchange rates could result in financial losses.

Risks Related to Our Taxes

Changes in tax legislation or policies could materially impact our financial
position and results of operations.

Corporate tax reform, anti-base-erosion rules and tax transparency continue to
be high priorities in many jurisdictions. As a result, policies regarding
corporate income and other taxes in numerous jurisdictions are under
heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation has been, and will likely
continue to be, proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions in which we
operate.

After enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, most of our income is
taxable in the U.S. with a significant portion taxable under the Global
Intangible Low-Taxed Income ("GILTI") regime. Beginning in fiscal year 2027,
the deduction allowable under the GILTI regime will decrease from 50% to
37.5%, which will increase the effective tax rate imposed on our income. The
U.S. also enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ("IRA") in August 2022,
which creates a new book minimum tax of at least 15% of consolidated GAAP pre-
tax income for corporations with average book income in excess of $1 billion.
The book minimum tax will first apply to our fiscal year 2024 and any increase
in our effective tax rate or cash tax will depend on a number of factors,
including any offsets for foreign tax credits or general business credits, or
changes in book income following business combinations. The IRA also creates
an excise tax of 1% of the value of any stock repurchased by us after December
31, 2022. We could be subject to this new excise tax, but the amount will vary
depending on various factors, including the amount and frequency of any stock
repurchases, applicability in certain business combination transactions, and
any permitted reductions or exceptions to the amount subject to the tax. If
(i) the U.S. tax rate increases, (ii) the deduction allowable under the GILTI
regime is further reduced or eliminated, (iii) additional limitations are put
on our ability to deduct interest expense, or (iv) the requirement for
research and development costs to be capitalized beginning in fiscal year 2023
remains in effect, our provision for income taxes, net income, and cash flows
would be adversely impacted.

In addition, many countries are implementing legislation and other guidance to
align their international tax rules with the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development's ("OECD") Base Erosion and Profit Shifting
recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global
corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer pricing
documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. The OECD is also
continuing discussions surrounding fundamental changes in allocation of
profits among tax jurisdictions in which companies do business, as well as the
implementation of a global minimum tax (namely the "Pillar One" and "Pillar
Two" proposals). Some countries intend to implement laws based on Pillar Two
proposals, which may adversely impact our provision for income taxes, net
income and cash flows. As a result of this heightened scrutiny, prior
decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate
income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities, and legislative
investigation and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies
or prior tax rulings. Any such changes may also result in the taxes we
previously paid being subject to change.

Any substantial changes in domestic or international corporate tax policies,
regulations or guidance, enforcement activities or legislative initiatives may
materially adversely affect our business, the amount of taxes we are required
to pay and our financial condition and results of operations generally.

If the tax incentives or tax holiday arrangements we have negotiated change or
cease to be in effect or applicable for any reason, or if our assumptions and
interpretations regarding tax laws and incentives or holiday arrangements
prove to be incorrect, our corporate income taxes could significantly
increase.

Our operations are currently structured to benefit from the various tax
incentives extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or
employment. For example, absent our principal tax incentives from the
Singapore Economic Development Board, which is scheduled to expire in 2025,
the corporate income tax rate that would apply to our Singapore taxable income
would be 17%. We also have a tax holiday on our qualifying income in Malaysia,
which is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2028. Each tax incentive and tax
holiday is subject to our compliance with various operating and other
conditions and may, in some instances, be amended or terminated prior to their
scheduled termination date by the relevant governmental authority. If we
cannot, or elect not to, comply with the operating conditions included in any
particular tax incentive or tax holiday, we could, in some instances, be
required to refund previously realized material tax benefits, or if such tax
incentive or tax holiday is terminated prior to its expiration absent a new
incentive applying, we will lose the related tax benefits earlier than
scheduled. In addition, we may be required, or elect, to modify our
operational structure and tax strategy in order to keep an incentive, which
could result in a decrease in the benefits of the incentive. Our tax
incentives could also be adversely impacted if the global minimum tax
provisions (Pillar Two) are adopted in a country in which we have an existing
tax incentive. Our tax incentives and tax holiday, before taking into
consideration U.S. foreign tax credits, decreased the provision for income
taxes by approximately $1,821 million in the aggregate and increased diluted
net income per share by $4.31 for fiscal year 2022.

Our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not
binding on any taxing authority, and if our assumptions about tax and other
laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or
rescinded, we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial
consequences, which would increase our expenses, reduce our profitability and
adversely affect our cash flows.

Our income taxes and overall cash tax costs are affected by a number of
factors that could materially, adversely affect financial results.

Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income taxes. In
the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions where the
ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Additionally, our calculations of
income taxes payable currently and on a deferred basis are based on our
interpretations of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which

29

Table of Contents

we are required to file tax returns. Although we believe our tax estimates are
reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of our income
tax liability will not be materially different than what is reflected in our
income tax provisions and accruals.

Our income taxes are subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by
numerous factors including:

•reorganization or restructuring of our businesses, tangible and intangible
assets, outstanding indebtedness and corporate structure;

•jurisdictional mix of our income and assets;

•changes in the allocation of income and expenses, including adjustments
related to changes in our corporate structure, acquisitions or tax law;

•changes in U.S and foreign tax laws and regulations, changes to the taxation
of earnings of foreign subsidiaries, taxation of U.S. income generated from
foreign sources, the deductibility of expenses attributable to income and
foreign tax credit rules;

•tax effects of increases in non-deductible employee compensation; and

•changes in tax accounting rules or principles and in the valuation of
deferred tax assets and liabilities.

We have adopted transfer pricing policies that call for the provision of
services, the sale of products, the arrangement of financing and the grant of
licenses from one affiliate to another at prices that we believe are
negotiated on an arm's length basis. Our taxable income is dependent upon
acceptance by local authorities that our operational practices and
intercompany transfer pricing are on an arm's length basis. Due to
inconsistencies in application of the arm's length standard among taxing
authorities, as well as lack of comprehensive treaty-based protection,
transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could, if successful, result in
adjustments for prior or future years. The effects of any such changes could
subject us to higher taxes and our earnings, results of operations and cash
flow would be adversely affected.

In addition, we are subject to, and are under, tax audit in various
jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against
us. Although we believe our tax positions are reasonable, the final
determination of tax audits could be materially different from our income tax
provisions and accruals. The ultimate result of an audit could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or
periods for which that determination is made.

Risks Related to Our Indebtedness

Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and
our ability to execute our business strategy.

As of October 30, 2022, the aggregate indebtedness under our senior notes was
$41,218 million. This amount does not reflect any debt we expect to incur or
assume in connection with the VMware Merger.

Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including:

•increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry
conditions;

•exposing us to interest rate risk due to our variable rate term facilities,
which we do not typically hedge against;

•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the
economy and the semiconductor industry;

•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with
less indebtedness;

•making it more difficult to borrow additional funds in the future to fund
growth, acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures and other
purposes; and

•potentially requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow
from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the
availability of our cash flow to fund our other business needs.

We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the U.S.
Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset
purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production growth
opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, reserve mix and
commodity pricing levels could also be considered by the rating agencies.
While we are focused on maintaining investment grade ratings from these
agencies, we may be unable to do so. Any downgrade in our credit rating or the
ratings of our indebtedness, or adverse conditions in the debt capital
markets, could:

•adversely affect the trading price of, or market for, our debt securities;

•increase interest expense under our term facilities;

•increase the cost of, and adversely affect our ability to refinance, our
existing debt; and

•adversely affect our ability to raise additional debt.

Table of Contents

The instruments governing our indebtedness impose certain restrictions on our
business.

The instruments governing our indebtedness contain certain covenants imposing
restrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect our ability to
operate our business, to plan for, or react to, changes in the market
conditions or our capital needs and may limit our ability to take advantage of
potential business opportunities as they arise. The restrictions placed on us
include maintenance of an interest coverage ratio and limitations on our
ability to incur certain secured debt, enter into certain sale and lease-back
transactions and consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of our assets. In addition, the instruments contain
customary events of default upon the occurrence of which, after any applicable
grace period, the indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.
In such event, we may not have sufficient available cash to repay such debt at
the time it becomes due, or be able to refinance such debt on acceptable terms
or at all. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have
sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.

Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest
on, and to refinance our debt, depends on our future performance, which is
subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors. Our business
may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future
sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our current indebtedness and any
future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures.
If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one
or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital
expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity
capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to
refinance our outstanding indebtedness or future indebtedness will depend on
the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be
able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on
desirable terms when needed, which could result in a default on our
indebtedness.

Risks Related to Owning Our Common Stock

At times, our stock price has been volatile and it may fluctuate substantially
in the future, which could result in substantial losses for our investors as
well as class action litigation against us and our management which could
cause us to incur substantial costs and divert our management's attention and
resources.

The trading price of our common stock has, at times, fluctuated significantly
and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to any of the risk
factors listed in this "Risk Factors" section, and others, including:

•issuance of new or updated research or other reports by securities analysts;

•fluctuations in the valuation and results of operations of our significant
customers as well as companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;

•announcements of proposed acquisitions by us or our competitors;

•announcements of, or expectations of, additional debt or equity financing
transactions;

•stock price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading
volume levels of our common stock;

•hedging or arbitrage trading activity involving our common stock; and

•unsubstantiated news reports or other inaccurate publicity regarding us or
our business.

These fluctuations are often unrelated or disproportionate to our operating
performance. Broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general
economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate
changes or currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of
our common stock. You may not realize any return on your investment in us and
may lose some or all of your investment. In the past, companies that have
experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to
securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of
litigation in the future. In addition, we have been, and in the future we may
be, subject to lawsuits stemming from our acquisitions, including the VMware
Merger. Securities litigation against us, including the lawsuits related to
such acquisitions, could result in substantial costs and divert our
management's attention from other business concerns, which could seriously
harm our business.

The amount and frequency of our stock repurchases may fluctuate.

The amount, timing and execution of our stock repurchase program may fluctuate
based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes. These purposes
include operational spending, capital spending, acquisitions, repayment of
debt and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments. Changes in
cash flows, tax laws and our stock price could also impact our stock
repurchase program. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific amount of
shares of common stock, and the stock repurchase program may be suspended or
terminated at any time.

Table of Contents

A substantial amount of our stock is held by a small number of large investors
and significant sales of our common stock by one or more of these holders
could cause our stock price to fall.

As of September 30, 2022, we believe 10 of our 20 largest holders of common
stock were active institutional investors who held approximately 27% of our
outstanding shares of common stock in the aggregate. These investors may sell
their shares at any time for a variety of reasons and such sales could depress
the market price of our common stock. In addition, any such sales of our
common stock by these entities could also impair our ability to raise capital
through the sale of additional equity securities.

There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends.

Our Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we
currently pay a cash dividend on our common stock on a quarterly basis. The
declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our
Board of Directors and our dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any
time. Because we are a holding company, our ability to pay cash dividends is
also limited by restrictions or limitations on our ability to obtain
sufficient funds through dividends from subsidiaries. There can be no
assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular
amounts, or at all.

ITEM 5.MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND
ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Market Information

Broadcom common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the
symbol "AVGO".

Holders

As of November 25, 2022, there were 1,060 holders of record of our common
stock. A substantially greater number of stockholders are "street name" or
beneficial holders, whose shares are held of record by banks, brokers and
other financial institutions.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

On August 1, 2022, we issued 9,923 restricted shares of our common stock to
one individual in connection with our acquisition of a company. The
restrictions lapse over three years subject to the individual's continued
employment. The issuance of these shares was exempt from registration under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in reliance upon Section 4(a)(2)
thereof.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

During the fiscal quarter ended October 30, 2022, we paid approximately $274
million in employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting of net settled
equity awards. We withheld approximately 1 million shares of common stock from
employees in connection with such net share settlement at an average price of
$502.62 per share. These shares may be deemed to be "issuer purchases" of
shares.

In December 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program
to repurchase up to $10 billion of our common stock from time to time on or
prior to December 31, 2022. During fiscal year 2022, we repurchased and
retired approximately 12 million shares of our common stock for $7 billion
under this stock repurchase program.

In May 2022, our Board of Directors authorized another stock repurchase
program to repurchase up to an additional $10 billion of our common stock from
time to time through December 31, 2023.

Repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be effected through a
variety of methods, including open market or privately negotiated purchases.
The timing and amount of shares repurchased will depend on the stock price,
business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements,
alternative investment opportunities, acquisition opportunities, and other
factors. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific amount of shares of
common stock, and the stock repurchase programs may be suspended or terminated
at any time.

ITEM 7\.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto, which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon
current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results
may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the
caption "Risk Factors" or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The following section generally discusses our financial condition and results
of operations for our fiscal year ended October 30, 2022 ("fiscal year 2022")
compared to our fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 ("fiscal year 2021"). A
discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for
fiscal year 2021 compared to our fiscal year ended November 1, 2020 ("fiscal
year 2020") can be found in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for fiscal year 2021, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") on December 17, 2021.

Overview

We are a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies a broad
range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. We develop
semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal
complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices and analog III-V based
products. We have a history of innovation in the semiconductor industry and
offer thousands of products that are used in end products such as enterprise
and data center networking, home connectivity, set-top boxes, broadband
access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones and base stations, data
center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and
alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Our infrastructure
software solutions enable customers to plan, develop, automate, manage and
secure applications across mainframe, distributed, mobile and cloud platforms.
Our portfolio of industry-leading infrastructure and security software is
designed to modernize, optimize, and secure the most complex hybrid
environments, enabling scalability, agility, automation, insights, resiliency
and security. We also offer mission critical fibre channel storage area
networking ("FC SAN") products and related software in the form of modules,
switches and subsystems incorporating multiple semiconductor products.

We have two reportable segments: semiconductor solutions and infrastructure
software. Our semiconductor solutions segment includes all of our product
lines and intellectual property ("IP") licensing. Our infrastructure software
segment includes our mainframe, distributed and cyber security solutions, and
our FC SAN business.

Our strategy is to combine best-of-breed technology leadership in
semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions, with unmatched scale, on
a common sales and administrative platform to deliver a comprehensive suite of
infrastructure technology products to the world's leading business and
government customers. We seek to achieve this through responsibly financed
acquisitions of category-leading businesses and technologies, as well as
investing extensively in research and development, to ensure our products
retain their technology leadership. This strategy results in a robust business
model designed to drive diversified and sustainable operating and financial
results.

The demand for our products has been affected in the past, and is likely to
continue to be affected in the future, by various factors, including the
following:

•gain or loss of significant customers;

•general economic and market conditions in the industries and markets in which
we compete;

•our distributors' product inventory and end customer demand;

•the rate at which our present and future customers and end-users adopt our
products and technologies in our target markets, and the rate at which our
customers' products that include our technology are accepted in their markets;

•the shift to cloud-based information technology solutions and services, such
as hyperscale computing, which may adversely affect the timing and volume of
sales of our products for use in traditional enterprise data centers; and

•the timing, rescheduling or cancellation of expected customer orders.

COVID-19 Update

The COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts to control it disrupted, and reduced the
efficiency of, normal business activities in much of the world. The pandemic
resulted in authorities around the world implementing numerous unprecedented
measures that created supply chain and market disruption, impacting our
workforce and operations, and those of our customers, contract manufacturers,
suppliers and logistics providers.

35

* * *

Table of Contents

While the demand environment for our semiconductor products was consistent
with our expectations for fiscal year 2022, with robust and increased
profitability driven by the supply imbalance, the macroeconomic environment
remains uncertain and it may not be sustainable over the longer term. We
continue to experience various constraints in our supply chain, including with
respect to wafers and substrates. Although supply lead times have stabilized,
we continue to have difficulties in obtaining some necessary components and
inputs in a timely manner to meet demand.

In response to the pandemic, we have taken extensive measures to protect the
health and safety of our employees and contractors at our facilities. We
continue to monitor the implications of the pandemic on our operations and may
modify our business practices and policies from time to time.

Our ability to predict the impact of the pandemic on our business remains
limited and its effects on our business are unlikely to be fully realized, or
reflected in our financial results, until future periods.

Fiscal Year Highlights

Highlights during fiscal year 2022 include the following:

•We generated $16,736 million of cash from operations.

•We paid $7,032 million in cash dividends.

•We repurchased $7,000 million of common stock.

Pending Acquisition of VMware, Inc.

On May 26, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "VMware
Merger Agreement") to acquire all of the outstanding shares of VMware, Inc.
("VMware") in a cash-and-stock transaction (the "VMware Merger") that values
VMware at approximately $61 billion, based on the closing price of Broadcom
common stock on May 25, 2022. We will also assume VMware's closing date
outstanding debt, net of expected cash.

Under the terms of the VMware Merger Agreement, each share of VMware common
stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
VMware Merger will be indirectly converted into the right to receive, at the
election of the holder of such share of VMware common stock, either $142.50 in
cash, without interest, or 0.2520 shares of Broadcom common stock. The
stockholder election will be subject to proration, such that the total number
of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive cash and the total number
of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive Broadcom common stock,
will, in each case, be equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of
VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time of the VMware Merger.

We will assume all outstanding VMware restricted stock unit ("RSU") awards and
performance stock unit awards held by continuing employees. The assumed awards
will be converted into RSU awards for shares of Broadcom common stock. All
outstanding in-the-money VMware stock options and RSU awards held by non-
employee directors will be accelerated and converted into the right to receive
cash and shares of Broadcom common stock, in equal parts.

Effective upon the effective time of the VMware Merger, one member of the
VMware Board of Directors, to be mutually agreed by us and VMware, will be
added to our Board of Directors.

In connection with the execution of the VMware Merger Agreement, we entered
into a commitment letter on May 26, 2022, with certain financial institutions
that committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions of the
commitment letter, a senior unsecured bridge facility in an aggregate
principal amount of $32 billion.

The VMware Merger, which is expected to be completed in our fiscal year ending
October 29, 2023 ("fiscal year 2023"), is subject to satisfaction or waiver of
customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the
waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976
and clearance under the antitrust laws of the European Union and certain other
jurisdictions. On October 3, 2022, we registered approximately 59 million
shares of our common stock. On November 4, 2022, VMware stockholders adopted
the VMware Merger Agreement. We and VMware each have termination rights under
the VMware Merger Agreement and, under specified circumstances, upon
termination of the agreement, we and VMware would be required to pay the other
a termination fee of $1.5 billion.

Net Revenue

A majority of our net revenue is derived from sales of a broad range of
semiconductor devices that are incorporated into electronic products, as well
as from modules, switches and subsystems. Net revenue is also generated from
the sale of software solutions that enable our customers to plan, develop,
automate, manage, and secure applications across mainframe, distributed,
mobile, and cloud platforms.

Our overall net revenue, as well as the percentage of total net revenue
generated by sales in our semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software
segments, have varied from quarter to quarter, due largely to fluctuations in
end-

market demand, including the effects of seasonality, which are discussed in
detail in Part I, Item 1. Business under "Seasonality" of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.

Distributors and original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), or their contract
manufacturers, typically account for the substantial majority of our
semiconductor sales. To serve customers around the world, we have
strategically developed relationships with large global electronic component
distributors, complemented by a number of regional distributors with customer
relationships based on their respective product ranges. We have established
strong relationships with leading OEM customers across multiple target
markets. Our direct sales force focuses on supporting our large OEM customers
and has specialized product and service knowledge that enables us to sell
specific offerings at key levels throughout a customer's organization. Certain
customers require us to contract with them directly and with specified
intermediaries, such as contract manufacturers. Many of our major customer
relationships have been in place for many years and are often the result of
years of collaborative product development. This has enabled us to build our
extensive IP portfolio and develop critical expertise regarding our customers'
requirements, including substantial system-level knowledge. This collaboration
has provided us with key insights into our customers' businesses and has
enabled us to be more efficient and productive and to better serve our target
markets and customers. We recognize revenue upon the delivery of our products
to the distributors, which can cause our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate
significantly. Such revenue is reduced for estimated returns and distributor
allowances.

Our software customers generally consist of large enterprises that have
computing environments from multiple vendors and are highly complex. We
believe our enterprise-wide license model will continue to offer our customers
reduced complexity, more flexibility and an easier renewal process that will
help drive revenue growth.

Costs and Expenses

Cost of products sold. Cost of products sold consists primarily of the costs
for semiconductor wafers and other materials, as well as the costs of
assembling and testing those products and materials. Such costs include
personnel and overhead related to our manufacturing operations, which include
stock-based compensation expense, related occupancy, computer services,
equipment costs, manufacturing quality, order fulfillment, warranty
adjustments, inventory adjustments including write-downs for inventory
obsolescence, and acquisition costs, which include direct transaction costs
and acquisition-related costs.

Although we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities,
we do have some proprietary semiconductor fabrication facilities. If we are
unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a desired level, the
fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed,
resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins.

Cost of subscriptions and services. Cost of subscriptions and services
consists of personnel, project costs associated with professional services or
support of our subscriptions and services revenue, and allocated facilities
costs and other corporate expenses. Personnel costs include stock-based
compensation expense.

Total cost of revenue also includes amortization of acquisition-related
intangible assets and restructuring charges.

Research and development. Research and development expense consists primarily
of personnel costs for our engineers engaged in the design and development of
our products and technologies, including stock-based compensation expense.
These expenses also include project material costs, third-party fees paid to
consultants, prototype development expense, allocated facilities costs and
other corporate expenses and computer services costs related to supporting
computer tools used in the engineering and design process.

Selling, general and administrative. Selling expense consists primarily of
compensation and associated costs for sales and marketing personnel, including
stock-based compensation expense, sales commissions paid to our independent
sales representatives, advertising costs, trade shows, corporate marketing,
promotion, travel related to our sales and marketing operations, related
occupancy and equipment costs, and other marketing costs. General and
administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs
for executive management, finance, human resources and other administrative
personnel, including stock-based compensation expense, outside professional
fees, allocated facilities costs, acquisition-related costs and other
corporate expenses.

Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. In connection with our
acquisitions, we recognize intangible assets that are being amortized over
their estimated useful lives. We also recognize goodwill, which is not
amortized, and in-process research and development ("IPR&D"), which is
initially capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, in connection
with the acquisitions. Upon completion of each underlying project, IPR&D
assets are reclassified as amortizable purchased intangible assets and
amortized over their estimated useful lives.

Restructuring, impairment and disposal charges. Restructuring, impairment and
disposal charges consist primarily of compensation costs associated with
employee exit programs, alignment of our global manufacturing operations,
rationalizing product development program costs, facility and lease
abandonments, fixed asset impairment, IPR&D impairment, and other exit costs,
including curtailment of service or supply agreements.

Interest expense.  Interest expense includes coupon interest, commitment fees,
accretion of original issue discount, amortization of debt premiums and debt
issuance costs, and expenses related to debt modifications or extinguishments.

Other income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net includes interest
income, gains or losses on investments, foreign currency remeasurement, and
other miscellaneous items.

Provision for income taxes. We have structured our operations to maximize the
benefit from tax incentives extended to us in various jurisdictions to
encourage investment or employment. Our tax incentives from the Singapore
Economic Development Board provide that any qualifying income earned in
Singapore is subject to tax incentives or reduced rates of Singapore income
tax, subject to our compliance with the conditions specified in these
incentives and legislative developments. These Singapore tax incentives are
presently expected to expire in November 2025. The corporate income tax rate
in Singapore that would otherwise apply to us would be 17%. We also have a tax
holiday on our qualifying income in Malaysia, which is scheduled to expire in
2028.

Each tax incentive and tax holiday is also subject to our compliance with
various operating and other conditions. If we cannot, or elect not to, comply
with any such operating conditions specified, we could, in some instances, be
required to refund previously realized material tax benefits, or if such tax
incentive or tax holiday is terminated prior to its expiration absent a new
incentive applying, we will lose the related tax benefits earlier than
scheduled. We may elect to modify our operational structure and tax strategy,
which may not be as beneficial to us as the benefits provided under the
present tax concession arrangements. Before taking into consideration the
effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other indirect tax impacts, the
effect of these tax incentives and tax holiday was to decrease the provision
for income taxes by approximately $1,821 million and $1,156 million for fiscal
years 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not
binding on any taxing authority, and if our assumptions about tax and other
laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or
rescinded, we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial
consequences, which would increase our expenses, reduce our profitability and
adversely affect our cash flows. In addition, taxable income in any
jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and
intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm's
length basis. Due to inconsistencies in application of the arm's length
standard among taxing authorities, as well as lack of adequate treaty-based
protection, transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could, if
successful, substantially increase our income tax expense.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on current
facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the
accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Our actual financial results may differ materially and adversely from
our estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our
historical financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective
or complex judgments by management. Those policies include revenue
recognition, valuation of goodwill and long-lived assets, and income taxes.
See Note 2. "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" included in Part II,
Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our
critical accounting policies and estimates.

Revenue recognition.  We account for a contract with a customer when both
parties have approved the contract and are committed to perform their
respective obligations, each party's rights can be identified, payment terms
can be identified, the contract has commercial substance, and it is probable
we will collect substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to.
Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied by
transferring control of a promised product or service to a customer. Our
products and services can be broadly categorized as sales of products and
subscriptions and services.

We recognize products revenue from sales to direct customers and distributors
when control transfers to the customer. An allowance for distributor credits
covering price adjustments is made based on our estimate of historical
experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual
terms. To date, actual distributor claims activity has been materially
consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates.
However, because of the inherent nature of estimates, there is always a risk
that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our
estimates. Different judgments or estimates could result in variances that
might be significant to reported operating results. We also record reductions
of revenue for rebates in the same period that the related revenue is
recorded. We accrue 100% of potential rebates at the time of sale. We reverse
the accrual of unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs
contractually end and when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject
to payment and will not be paid. Thus, the reversal of unclaimed rebates may
have a positive impact on our net revenue and net income in subsequent
periods.

Valuation of goodwill and long-lived assets.  We perform an annual impairment
review of our goodwill during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year, and more
frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. The process of
evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and
requires significant judgment. To review for impairment, we first assess
qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances lead to a
determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of
our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. Our qualitative
assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, whether performed annually or
based on specific events or circumstances, considers various macroeconomic,
industry-specific and company-specific factors. These factors include: (i)
severe adverse industry or economic trends; (ii) significant company-specific
actions, including exiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of
operations; (iii) current, historical or projected deterioration of our
financial performance; or (iv) a sustained decrease in our market
capitalization below our net book value. After assessing the totality of
events and circumstances, if we determine that it is not more likely than not
that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying
amount, no further assessment is performed. If we determine that it is more
likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than
its carrying amount, we calculate the fair value of that reporting unit and
compare the fair value to the reporting unit's net book value.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant
estimates and assumptions. Our goodwill impairment test uses both the income
approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair value.
The income approach is based on the discounted cash flow method that uses the
reporting unit estimates for forecasted future financial performance,
including revenues, operating expenses, and taxes, as well as working capital
and capital asset requirements. These estimates are developed as part of our
long-term planning process based on assumed market segment growth rates and
our assumed market segment share, estimated costs based on historical data and
various internal estimates. Projected cash flows are then discounted to a
present value employing a discount rate that properly accounts for the
estimated market weighted-average cost of capital, as well as any risk unique
to the subject cash flows. The market approach is based on weighting the
financial multiples of comparable companies and applying a control premium. A
reporting unit's carrying value represents the assignment of various assets
and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as
cash and debt.

We assess the impairment of long-lived assets, including purchased IPR&D,
property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets, whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may
not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which could trigger an
impairment review include: (i) significant under-performance relative to
historical or projected future operating results, (ii) significant changes in
the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall
business, or (iii) significant negative industry or economic trends. The
process of evaluating the potential impairment of long-lived assets under the
accounting guidance on property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets is
also highly subjective and requires significant judgment. In order to estimate
the fair value of long-lived assets, we typically make various assumptions
about the future prospects of our business or the part of our business to
which the long-lived assets relate. We also consider market factors specific
to the business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by the
business, which requires significant judgment as it is based on assumptions
about market demand for our products over a number of future years. Based on
these assumptions and estimates, we determine whether we need to take an
impairment charge to reduce the value of the long-lived assets stated on our
consolidated balance sheets to reflect their estimated fair value. Assumptions
and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and
often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including
external factors, such as the real estate market, industry and economic
trends, and internal factors, such as changes in our business strategy and our
internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have
made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions
and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results.

Income taxes. Significant management judgment is required in developing our
provision for or benefit from income taxes, including the determination of
deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be
required against the deferred tax assets. We have considered projected future
taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in
assessing the need for valuation allowances. An adjustment to the valuation
allowance will either increase or decrease our provision for or benefit from
income taxes in the period such determination is made. In evaluating the
exposure associated with various tax filing positions, we accrue an income tax
liability when such positions do not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold
for recognition.

The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in
the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of
jurisdictions. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit
issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of
whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes, interest, and penalties
will be due. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than
the actual amount ultimately assessed, a further charge to tax expense would
be required. If the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be
unnecessary, the reversal of the accrued liabilities would result in tax
benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities no
longer exist.

Net Revenue

A relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of
our net revenue. Sales of products to distributors accounted for 56% and 53%
of our net revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Direct sales
to WT Microelectronics Co., Ltd., a distributor, accounted for 20% and 18% of
our net revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. We believe
aggregate sales to our top five end customers, through all channels, accounted
for approximately 35% of our net revenue for each of fiscal years 2022 and
2021. We believe aggregate sales to Apple Inc., through all channels,
accounted for approximately 20% of our net revenue for each of fiscal years
2022 and 2021. We expect to continue to experience significant customer
concentration in future periods. The loss of, or significant decrease in
demand from, any of our top five end customers could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

From time to time, some of our key semiconductor customers place large orders
or delay orders, causing our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly.
This is particularly true of our wireless products as fluctuations may be
magnified by the timing of launches, and seasonal variations in sales, of
mobile devices. The COVID-19 pandemic and macroeconomic uncertainties may
cause our net revenue to fluctuate significantly and impact our results of
operations.

Although we recognize revenue for the majority of our products when title and
control transfer in Penang, Malaysia, we disclose net revenue by country based
primarily on the geographic shipment or delivery location specified by our
distributors, OEMs, contract manufacturers, channel partners, or software
customers. In each of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, approximately 35% of our net
revenue came from shipments or deliveries to China (including Hong Kong).
However, the end customers for either our products or for the end products
into which our products are incorporated, are frequently located in countries
other than China (including Hong Kong). As a result, we believe that a
substantially smaller percentage of our net revenue is ultimately dependent on
sales of either our product or our customers' product incorporating our
product, to end customers located in China (including Hong Kong).

Total net revenue| | 100 | %| | 100 | %  
  
Net revenue from our semiconductor solutions segment increased due to strong
product demand, primarily for networking, server storage and broadband
products, as well as higher demand for our wireless content in mobile devices.
Net revenue from our infrastructure software segment increased primarily due
to higher demand for our mainframe solutions and FC SAN products.

Gross Margin

Gross margin was $22,095 million, or 67% of net revenue, for fiscal year 2022,
compared to $16,844 million, or 61% of net revenue, for fiscal year 2021. The
increase was primarily due to lower amortization of acquisition-related
intangible assets, mainly from our 2016 acquisition of Broadcom Corporation
and, to a lesser extent, favorable margin within our semiconductor solutions
segment.

Research and Development Expense

Research and development expense increased $65 million, or 1%, in fiscal year
2022, compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to
higher variable employee compensation expense and engineering project costs,
partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense reflecting the full
vesting of certain equity awards and the effects of forfeitures.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense

Selling, general and administrative expense increased $35 million, or 3%, in
fiscal year 2022, compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was
primarily due to higher variable employee compensation expense, offset in part
by lower stock-based compensation expense.

Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets

Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets recognized in operating
expenses decreased $464 million, or 23%, in fiscal year 2022, compared to the
prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to lower amortization of
certain intangible assets from our acquisition of CA, Inc.

Restructuring, Impairment and Disposal Charges

Restructuring, impairment and disposal charges recognized in operating
expenses decreased $91 million, or 61%, in fiscal year 2022, compared to the
prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to lower employee
termination costs following the completion of key restructuring activities
from acquisitions.

Stock-Based Compensation Expense

Total stock-based compensation expense was $1,533 million and $1,704 million
for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease primarily reflects
the full vesting of certain equity awards and the effect of forfeitures.

The following table sets forth the total unrecognized compensation cost
related to unvested stock-based awards outstanding and expected to vest as of
October 30, 2022, which we expect to recognize over the remaining weighted-
average service period of 2.7 years.

During the first quarter of fiscal year ended November 3, 2019 ("fiscal year
2019"), our Compensation Committee approved a broad-based program of multi-
year equity grants of time- and market-based RSUs (the "Multi-Year Equity
Awards") in lieu of our annual employee equity awards historically granted on
March 15 of each year. Each Multi-Year Equity Award vests on the same basis as
four annual grants made March 15 of each year, beginning in fiscal year 2019,
with successive four-year vesting periods. We recognize stock-based
compensation expense related to the Multi-Year Equity Awards from the grant
date through their respective vesting date, ranging from 4 years to 7 years.

Operating income from our semiconductor solutions segment increased primarily
due to higher net revenue from networking, server storage, broadband, and
wireless products, as well as higher gross margin. Operating income from our
infrastructure software segment increased primarily due to higher demand for
our mainframe solutions and FC SAN products.

Unallocated expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible
assets; stock-based compensation expense; restructuring, impairment and
disposal charges; acquisition-related costs; and other costs that are not used
in evaluating the results of, or in allocating resources to, our segments.
Unallocated expenses decreased 18% in fiscal year 2022, compared to the prior
fiscal year, primarily due to lower amortization of acquisition-related
intangible assets.

Non-Operating Income and Expenses

Interest expense. Interest expense was $1,737 million and $1,885 million for
fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to
lower losses on extinguishment of debt. We expect to incur additional interest
expense in future periods as a result of indebtedness associated with the
pending VMware Merger.

Other income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net, includes interest
income, gains or losses on investments, foreign currency remeasurement and
other miscellaneous items. Other expense, net, was $54 million for fiscal year
2022, compared to other income, net, of $131 million for fiscal year 2021. The
change was primarily due to changes in investment gains or losses.

Provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes was $939 million
and $29 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase was
primarily due to higher income from continuing operations before income taxes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The following section discusses our principal liquidity and capital resources
as well as our primary liquidity requirements and uses of cash. Our cash and
cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining
maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. We believe our cash
equivalents are liquid and accessible.

Our primary sources of liquidity as of October 30, 2022 consisted of: (i)
$12,416 million in cash and cash equivalents, (ii) cash we expect to generate
from operations and (iii) available capacity under our $7.5 billion unsecured
revolving credit

43

Table of Contents

facility (the "Revolving Facility"). In addition, we may also generate cash
from the sale of assets and debt or equity financing from time to time.

Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from: (i)
business acquisitions and investments we may make from time to time, including
the pending VMware Merger, (ii) working capital requirements, (iii) research
and development and capital expenditure needs, (iv) cash dividend payments (if
and when declared by our Board of Directors), (v) interest and principal
payments related to our $41,218 million of outstanding indebtedness, (vi)
share repurchases, and (vii) payment of income taxes. Our ability to fund
these requirements will depend, in part, on our future cash flows, which are
determined by our future operating performance and, therefore, subject to
prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial, business and other
factors, some of which are beyond our control. We expect capital expenditures
to be higher in fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022. Our debt and
liquidity needs will increase as a result of the pending VMware Merger, and we
intend to fund the cash portion of the consideration with $32 billion in new,
fully committed debt financing.

We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flows from
operations, and the Revolving Facility, as well as the committed debt funding
related to the pending VMware Merger, will provide sufficient liquidity to
operate our business and fund our current and assumed obligations for at least
the next 12 months. For additional information regarding our cash requirement
from contractual obligations, indebtedness and lease obligations, see Note 14.
"Commitments and Contingencies", Note 10. "Borrowings" and Note 6. "Leases" in
Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

From time to time, we engage in discussions with third parties regarding
potential acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, technologies and
product lines. Any such transaction, or evaluation of potential transactions,
could require significant use of our cash and cash equivalents, or require us
to increase our borrowings to fund such transactions. If we do not have
sufficient cash to fund our operations or finance growth opportunities,
including acquisitions, or unanticipated capital expenditures, our business
and financial condition could suffer. In such circumstances, we may seek to
obtain new debt or equity financing. However, we cannot assure you that such
additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.
Our ability to service our senior unsecured notes and any other indebtedness
we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. We may
also elect to sell additional debt or equity securities for reasons other than
those specified above.

In addition, we may, at any time and from time to time, seek to retire or
purchase our outstanding debt through cash tenders and/or exchanges for equity
or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or
otherwise. Such tenders, exchanges or purchases, if any, will be upon such
terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing
market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and
other factors. The amounts involved may be material.

Working Capital

Working capital increased to $11,452 million at October 30, 2022 from $10,305
million at October 31, 2021. The increase was attributable to the following:

•Accounts receivable increased to $2,958 million at October 30, 2022 from
$2,071 million at October 31, 2021, primarily due to revenue linearity and
less receivables sold through factoring arrangements.

•Inventory increased to $1,925 million at October 30, 2022 from $1,297 million
at October 31, 2021, primarily to support customer demand and due to higher
material costs.

•Cash and cash equivalents increased to $12,416 million at October 30, 2022
from $12,163 million at October 31, 2021, primarily due to $16,736 million in
net cash provided by operating activities and $1,935 million in proceeds from
long-term borrowings, partially offset by $7,032 million of dividend payments,
$7,000 million of common stock repurchases, $2,361 million of debt payments,
and $1,455 million of employee withholding tax payments related to net settled
equity awards.

•Other current assets increased to $1,205 million at October 30, 2022 from
$1,055 million at October 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in prepaid
taxes, offset in part by a decrease in short-term investments.

These increases in working capital were offset in part by the following:

•Other current liabilities increased to $4,412 million at October 30, 2022
from $3,839 million at October 31, 2021, primarily due to increases in
contract liabilities, taxes payable and interest payable.

•Current portion of long-term debt increased to $440 million at October 30,
2022 from $290 million at October 31, 2021, primarily due to certain debt
instruments becoming due within the next twelve months, offset in part by
repayments.

•Employee compensation and benefits increased to $1,202 million at October 30,
2022 from $1,066 million at October 31, 2021, primarily due to higher variable
compensation based on current fiscal year performance.

retired approximately 12 million shares of our common stock for $7 billion
under this stock repurchase program. In May 2022, our Board of Directors
authorized another stock repurchase program to repurchase up to an additional
$10 billion of our common stock from time to time through December 31, 2023.

Repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be effected through a
variety of methods, including open market or privately negotiated purchases.
The timing and amount of shares repurchased will depend on the stock price,
business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements,
alternative investment opportunities, acquisition opportunities, and other
factors. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific amount of shares of
common stock, and the stock repurchase programs may be suspended or terminated
at any time.

During fiscal years 2022 and 2021, we paid approximately $1,455 million and
$1,299 million, respectively, in employee withholding taxes due upon the
vesting of net settled equity awards. We withheld approximately 3 million
shares of common stock from employees in connection with such net share
settlements during each of fiscal years 2022 and 2021.

Net cash used in financing activities| | (15,816)| | | (8,974)|  
Net change in cash and cash equivalents| | $| 253 | | | $| 4,545 |  
  
Operating Activities

Cash provided by operating activities consisted of net income adjusted for
certain non-cash and other items and changes in assets and liabilities. The
$2,972 million increase in cash provided by operations during fiscal year 2022
compared to fiscal year 2021 was due to $4,759 million higher net income and
certain non-cash adjustments including deferred taxes and other non-cash
taxes, offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets and stock-
based compensation, as well as a $1,527 million decrease resulting from
changes in operating assets and liabilities.

Investing Activities

Cash flows from investing activities primarily consisted of cash used for
acquisitions, capital expenditures, and sales and purchases of investments.
The $422 million increase in cash used in investing activities for fiscal year
2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to a $238 million increase
in cash paid for acquisitions and $169 million lower net proceeds from sales
of investments.

Financing Activities

Cash flows from financing activities primarily consisted of dividend payments,
stock repurchases, proceeds and payments related to our long-term borrowings,
and employee withholding tax payments related to net settled equity awards.
The $6,842 million increase in cash used in financing activities for fiscal
year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily

due to $7,000 million in common stock repurchases, a $820 million increase in
dividend payments, and a $156 million increase in employee withholding tax
payments related to net settled equity awards, offset in part by a $1,165
million change in net borrowing activities.

Accounting Changes and Recent Accounting Standards

For a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards,
including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, in our
consolidated financial statements, see Note 2\. "Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies" included in Part II, Item 8. of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

From time to time, we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a
portion of our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates, which result
from our global operating and financing activities. We do not use derivative
financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Gains and losses
from foreign currency transactions, as well as foreign exchange forward
contracts, were not significant for any period presented in the consolidated
financial statements included in this Form 10-K. As of October 30, 2022, we
did not have any outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts.

Interest Rate Risk

Changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our outstanding debt. As of
October 30, 2022, we had $41.2 billion in principal amount of debt
outstanding. The carrying amount of the debt was $39.5 billion, and the
estimated aggregate fair value of debt was $33.0 billion. As of October 30,
2022, a hypothetical 50 basis points increase or decrease in market interest
rates would change the fair value of debt by a decrease or increase of
approximately $1.6 billion. However, this hypothetical change in interest
rates would not impact the interest expense on our debt as we only had fixed
rate senior notes outstanding. To hedge variability of cash flows due to
changes in the benchmark interest rate of anticipated future debt issuances,
we have entered, and in the future may enter, into treasury rate lock
contracts.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

  

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Broadcom Inc.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

  

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Broadcom Inc.
and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of October 30, 2022 and October 31,
2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive
income, of stockholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended October 30, 2022, including the related notes and
financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2)
(collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also
have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
October 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

  

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of October 30, 2022 and October 31, 2021, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
October 30, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of October 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

  

Change in Accounting Principle

  

As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in fiscal 2020.

  

Basis for Opinions

  

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial
statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to
express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the
Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent
with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.

  

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.

  

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.

  

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

  

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and

expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

  

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

  

Critical Audit Matters

  

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the
current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that
(i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated
financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective,
or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not
alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken
as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,
providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts
or disclosures to which it relates.

  

Uncertain Tax Positions (UTPs)

  

As described in Notes 2 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the
gross unrecognized tax benefits balance was $5,117 million as of October 30,
2022. As management has disclosed, management evaluates the exposure
associated with various tax filing positions and accrues an income tax
liability when such positions do not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold
for recognition. A tax benefit from an UTP may be recognized when it is more
likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination,
including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on
the technical merits.

  

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures
relating to the UTPs is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant
judgment by management when evaluating the technical merits of these tax
positions, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in
performing procedures and evaluating the technical merits of the tax
positions, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with
specialized skill and knowledge.

  

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit
evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of
controls relating to the identification and recognition of the income tax
liability for UTPs, including controls addressing the completeness of the UTPs
and the measurement of the income tax liability. These procedures also
included, among others, (i) testing management's process for identifying
potential new UTPs, (ii) for a selection of UTPs, evaluating possible
outcomes, and (iii) for a selection of UTPs, testing the calculation of the
income tax liability by jurisdiction, including management's assessment of the
technical merits of tax positions and estimates of the amount of tax benefit
expected to be sustained. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge
were used to assist in (i) the evaluation of the completeness of management's
identification of the UTPs and (ii) for a selection of UTPs, the evaluation of
the reasonableness of management's assessment of whether the tax positions are
more-likely-than-not of being sustained, the amount of potential benefit to be
realized, and the application of relevant tax laws.

mean Broadcom and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Basis of Presentation

We operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to
October 31 in a 52-week year and the first Sunday in November in a 53-week
year. Our fiscal year ended October 30, 2022 ("fiscal year 2022") was a
52-week fiscal year. The first quarter of our fiscal year 2022 ended on
January 30, 2022, the second quarter ended on May 1, 2022 and the third
quarter ended on July 31, 2022. Our fiscal year ended October 31, 2021
("fiscal year 2021") and fiscal year ended November 1, 2020 ("fiscal year
2020") were both 52-week fiscal years.

On November 4, 2019, we completed the purchase of certain assets and
assumption of certain liabilities of the Symantec Corporation Enterprise
Security business (the "Symantec Business"). We have two reportable segments:
semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. See Note 13. "Segment
Information" for additional information.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Broadcom and its subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). All
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

2\. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Foreign currency remeasurement. We operate in a U.S. dollar functional
currency environment. Foreign currency assets and liabilities for monetary
accounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates. Non-
monetary items such as inventory and property, plant and equipment, are
measured and recorded at historical exchange rates. The effects of foreign
currency remeasurement were not material for any period presented.

Use of estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The inputs into
certain of these estimates and assumptions include the consideration of the
economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and many of these estimates could
require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and
volatility. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, and
such differences could affect the results of operations reported in future
periods.

Cash and cash equivalents. We consider all highly liquid investment securities
with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be
cash equivalents. We determine the appropriate classification of our cash and
cash equivalents at the time of purchase.

Trade accounts receivable, net. Trade accounts receivable are recognized at
the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Accounts receivable are reduced
by an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is our best estimate of the
expected credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the
allowance based on historical experience, current economic conditions and
certain forward-looking information, among other factors. Allowances for
doubtful accounts were not material as of October 30, 2022 or October 31,
2021. Accounts receivable are also recognized net of sales returns and
distributor credit allowances. These amounts are recognized when it is both
probable and estimable that discounts will be granted or products will be
returned. Allowances for sales returns and distributor credit allowances as of
October 30, 2022 and October 31, 2021 were $126 million and $129 million,
respectively.

Concentrations of credit risk and significant customers. Our cash, cash
equivalents and accounts receivable are potentially subject to concentration
of credit risk. Cash and cash equivalents may be redeemable upon demand and
are maintained with financial institutions that management believes are of
high credit quality and therefore bear minimal credit risk. We seek to
mitigate our credit risks by spreading such risks across multiple
counterparties and monitoring the risk profile of these counterparties. Our
accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned from customers located
both within and outside the U.S. We mitigate collection risks from our
customers by performing regular credit evaluations of our customers' financial
conditions, and require collateral, such as letters of credit and bank
guarantees, in certain circumstances.

Concentration of other risks. We operate in markets that are highly
competitive and rapidly changing. Significant technological changes, shifting
customer needs, the emergence of competitive products with new capabilities,
general economic conditions worldwide, the ability to safeguard patents and
other intellectual property ("IP") in a rapidly evolving market and reliance
on assembly and test subcontractors, third-party wafer fabricators and
independent distributors and other factors could affect our financial results.

Inventory. We value our inventory at the lower of actual cost or net
realizable value of the inventory, with cost being determined under the first-
in, first-out method. We record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory
based primarily on our forecast of product demand and production requirements.
The excess and obsolete balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis
for our excess and obsolete inventory charge and the written-down value of the
inventory becomes its new cost basis.

Retirement benefit plans. For defined benefit pension plans, we consider
various factors in determining our respective benefit obligations and net
periodic benefit (income) cost, including the number of employees that we
expect to receive benefits, their salary levels and years of service, the
expected return on plan assets, the discount rate, the timing of the payment
of benefits, and other actuarial assumptions. If the actual results and events
of the benefit plans differ from our current assumptions, the benefit
obligations may be over- or under-valued.

The key assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on
plan assets. The U.S. discount rates are based on a hypothetical yield curve
constructed using high-quality corporate bonds selected to yield cash flows
that match the expected timing and amount of the benefit payments. The U.S.
expected rate of return on plan assets is set equal to the discount rate due
to the implementation of our fully-matched, liability-driven investment
strategy. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. For the non-U.S.
plans, we set assumptions specific to each country. We have elected to measure
defined benefit pension plan assets and liabilities as of October 31, which is
the month end that is closest to our fiscal year end.

Derivative instruments. We use derivative financial instruments to manage
exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk. We do not use
derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

Outstanding derivatives are recognized as assets or liabilities at their fair
values based on Level 2 inputs, as defined in the fair value hierarchy. For
derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the changes in fair
value are initially recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of
tax in the period of change, and are subsequently reclassified and recognized
in the same line item as the hedged item when either the hedged transactions
affect earnings or it becomes probable that the hedged transactions will not
occur.

We use foreign exchange forward contracts to manage exposure to foreign
exchange risk. These forward contracts are not designated as hedging
instruments, and the changes in fair value are recognized in other income
(expense), net in the period of change. We did not have any outstanding
foreign exchange forward contracts as of October 30, 2022 or October 31, 2021.
The gains and losses recorded in other income (expense), net for derivative
instruments not designated as hedges were not material.

During fiscal year 2022, we entered into treasury rate lock contracts that
mature in approximately one year to hedge variability of cash flows due to
changes in the benchmark interest rate of anticipated future debt issuances.
These treasury rate locks are designated and accounted for as cash flow
hedging instruments. As of October 30, 2022, the total notional amount of
these contracts was $1.3 billion, and the fair value of these contracts was
$47 million, which was recorded as a derivative asset with the gains recorded
net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss on our
consolidated balance sheet.

Property, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment are stated at
cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Additions, improvements
and major renewals are capitalized, and maintenance, repairs and minor
renewals are expensed as incurred. Assets are held in construction in progress
until placed in service, upon which date, we begin to depreciate these assets.
When assets are retired or disposed of, the assets and related accumulated
depreciation and amortization are removed from our property, plant and
equipment balances and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the
consolidated statements of operations. Buildings and leasehold improvements
are generally depreciated over 15 to 40 years,

55

* * *

Table of Contents

or over the lease period, whichever is shorter, and machinery and equipment
are generally depreciated over 3 to 10 years. We use the straight-line method
of depreciation for all property, plant and equipment.

Leases. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at the
inception of the arrangement and evaluate whether the lease is an operating
lease or a finance lease at the commencement date. We recognize right-of-use
("ROU") assets and lease liabilities for operating and finance leases with
terms greater than 12 months, and account for the lease and non-lease
components as a single component. ROU assets represent our right to use an
asset for the lease term, while lease liabilities represent our obligation to
make lease payments. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities
are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease
term at the lease commencement date. We use the implicit interest rate or, if
not readily determinable, our incremental borrowing rate as of the lease
commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. The
incremental borrowing rate is based on our unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted
for the effects of collateral. Operating and finance lease ROU assets are
recognized net of any lease prepayments and incentives. Lease terms may
include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain
that we will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease expense is recognized
based on the effective-interest method over the lease term.

Fair value measurement. Fair value is defined as the price that would be
received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level
hierarchy is applied to prioritize the inputs to valuation techniques used to
measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1
measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3
measurements).

The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under the guidance for fair value
measurements are described below:

Level 1 -- Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to
access at the measurement date. Our Level 1 assets include cash equivalents,
banker's acceptances, trading securities investments and investment funds. We
measure trading securities investments and investment funds at quoted market
prices as they are traded in active markets with sufficient volume and
frequency of transactions.

Level 2 -- Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within
Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified contractual term, a
Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset
or liability.

Level 3 -- Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability
in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability
at the measurement date. Level 3 assets and liabilities include investment in
equity securities without readily determinable fair values, goodwill,
intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment, which are measured at
fair value using a discounted cash flow approach when they are impaired.
Quantitative information for Level 3 assets and liabilities reviewed at each
reporting period includes indicators of significant deterioration in the
earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, business prospects of the
investee, and financial indicators of the investee's ability to continue as a
going concern.

Business combinations. We account for business combinations under the
acquisition method of accounting, which requires us to recognize separately
from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their
acquisition date fair values. While we use our best estimates and assumptions
to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition
date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are
inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the
measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we
record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the
corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement
period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities
assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recognized in
our consolidated statements of operations. Accounting for business
combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and
assumptions, especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for
intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, restructuring liabilities,
pre-acquisition contingencies, and contingent consideration, where applicable.
Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past
have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical
experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired
companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain
acquired intangible assets under the income approach include growth in future
expected cash flows from product sales, customer contracts and acquired
technologies, revenue growth rate, customer ramp-up period, technology
obsolescence rates, expected costs to develop in-process research and
development ("IPR&D") into commercially viable products, estimated cash flows
from the projects when completed and discount rates. Unanticipated events and
circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such
assumptions, estimates or actual results.

Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs
over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets
of businesses acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed annually (or
more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. To review for
impairment we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or
circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the
fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. Our
qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, whether performed
annually or based on specific events or circumstances, considers various
macroeconomic, industry-specific and company-specific factors. Those factors
include: (i) severe adverse industry or economic trends; (ii) significant
company-specific actions, including exiting an activity in conjunction with
restructuring of operations; (iii) current, historical or projected
deterioration of our financial performance; or (iv) a sustained decrease in
our market capitalization below our net book value. After assessing the
totality of events and circumstances, if we determine that it is not more
likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than
its carrying amount, no further assessment is performed. If we determine that
it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units
is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the fair value of that
reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit's net book
value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its net book
value, there is no impairment. Otherwise, we calculate the implied fair value
of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible assets,
excluding goodwill, of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting
unit. The implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying value of
goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying
value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference.
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant
estimates and assumptions.

Long-lived assets. Purchased finite-lived intangible assets are carried at
cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recognized over the
periods during which the intangible assets are expected to contribute to our
cash flows. Purchased IPR&D projects are capitalized at fair value as an
indefinite-lived intangible asset and assessed for impairment thereafter. Upon
completion of each underlying project, IPR&D assets are reclassified as
amortizable purchased intangible assets and amortized over their estimated
useful lives. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, we recognize the carrying
value of the related intangible asset in our consolidated statements of
operations in the period it is abandoned. On a quarterly basis, we monitor
factors and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of
long-lived assets, including purchased intangible assets and property, plant
and equipment, may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which
could trigger an impairment review include: (i) significant under-performance
relative to historical or projected future operating results, (ii) significant
changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for
our overall business, and (iii) significant negative industry or economic
trends. An impairment loss must be measured if the sum of the expected future
cash flows (undiscounted and before interest) from the use and eventual
disposition of the asset (or asset group) is less than the net book value of
the asset (or asset group). The amount of the impairment loss will generally
be measured as the difference between the net book value of the asset (or
asset group) and the estimated fair value.

Warranty. We accrue for the estimated costs of product warranties at the time
revenue is recognized. Product warranty costs are estimated based upon our
historical experience and specific identification of the product requirements,
which may fluctuate based on product mix. Additionally, we accrue for warranty
costs associated with occasional or unanticipated product quality issues if a
loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.

Revenue recognition. We account for a contract with a customer when both
parties have approved the contract and are committed to perform their
respective obligations, each party's rights can be identified, payment terms
can be identified, the contract has commercial substance, and it is probable
we will collect substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to.
Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied by
transferring control of a promised product or service to a customer.

Nature of Products and Services

Our products and services can be broadly categorized as sales of products and
subscriptions and services. The following is a description of the principal
activities from which we generate revenue.

Products. We recognize revenue from sales to direct customers and distributors
when control transfers to the customer. Rebates and incentives offered to
distributors, which are earned when sales to end customers are completed, are
estimated at the point of revenue recognition. We have elected to exclude from
the transaction price any taxes collected from a customer and to account for
shipping and handling activities performed after a customer obtains control of
the product as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the product. From
time to time, certain customers agree to pay us secure supply fees in exchange
for prioritized fulfillment of product orders. Such fees are included in the
transaction price of the product orders and are recognized as revenue in the
period that control over the products is transferred to the customer.

Subscriptions and services.  Our subscriptions and services revenue consists
of sales and royalties from software arrangements, support services,
professional services, transfer of IP, and non-recurring engineering ("NRE")
arrangements.

Revenue from software arrangements primarily consists of fees, which may be
paid either at contract inception or in

57

* * *

Table of Contents

installments over the contract term, that provide customers with a right to
use the software, access general support and maintenance, and utilize our
professional services.

Our software licenses have standalone functionality from which customers
derive benefit, and the customer obtains control of the software when it is
delivered or made available for download. We believe that for the majority of
software arrangements, customers derive significant benefit from the ongoing
support we provide. The majority of our subscriptions and services
arrangements permit our customers to unilaterally terminate or cancel these
arrangements at any time at the customer's convenience, referred to as
termination for convenience provisions, without substantive termination
penalty and receive a pro-rata refund of any prepaid fees. Accordingly, we
account for arrangements with these termination for convenience provisions as
a series of daily contracts, resulting in ratable revenue recognition of
software revenue over the contractual period.

Support services consist primarily of telephone support and the provision of
unspecified updates and upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis. Support
services represent stand-ready obligations for which revenue is recognized
ratably over the term of the arrangement.

Professional services consist of implementation, consulting, customer
education and customer training services. The obligation to provide
professional services is generally satisfied over time, with the customer
simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefits as we satisfy our
performance obligations.

Rights to our IP are either sold or licensed to a customer. IP revenue
recognition is dependent on the nature and terms of each agreement. We
recognize IP revenue upon delivery of the IP if there are no substantive
future obligations to perform under the arrangement. Sales-based or usage-
based royalties from the license of IP are recognized at the later of the
period the sales or usages occur or the satisfaction of the performance
obligation to which some or all of the sales-based or usage-based royalties
have been allocated.

There are two main categories of NRE contracts that we enter into with our
customers: (a) NRE contracts in which we develop a custom chip and (b) NRE
contracts in which we accelerate our development of a new chip upon the
customer's request. The majority of our NRE contract revenues meet the over
time criteria. As such, revenue is recognized over the development period with
the measure of progress using the input method based on costs incurred to
total cost as the services are provided. For NRE contracts that do not meet
the over time criteria, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the NRE
services are complete.

Material rights. Contracts with customers may also include material rights
that are also performance obligations. These include the right to renew or
receive products or services at a discounted price in the future. Revenue
allocated to material rights is recognized when the customer exercises the
right or the right expires.

Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations

Our contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed
above, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance
obligation.

Allocation of consideration. We allocate total contract consideration to each
distinct performance obligation in a bundled arrangement on a relative
standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price reflects the
price we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold
separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers.

Standalone selling price. When available, we use directly observable
transactions to determine the standalone selling prices for performance
obligations. When directly observable transactions are not available, our
estimates of standalone selling price for each performance obligation require
judgment that considers multiple factors, including, but not limited to,
historical discounting trends for products and services and pricing practices
through different sales channels, gross margin objectives, internal costs,
competitor pricing strategies, technology lifecycles and market conditions.

We separately determine the standalone selling prices by product or service
type. Additionally, we segment the standalone selling prices for products
where the pricing strategies differ, and where there are differences in
customers and circumstances that warrant segmentation.

We also estimate the standalone selling price of our material rights. We
estimate the value of the customer's option to purchase or receive additional
products or services at a discounted price by estimating the incremental
discount the customer would obtain when exercising the option and the
likelihood that the option would be exercised.

Other Policies and Judgments

Contract modifications. We may modify contracts to offer customers additional
products or services. Each of the additional products and services is
generally considered distinct from those products or services transferred to
the customer before the modification. We evaluate whether the contract price
for the additional products and services reflects the

58

* * *

Table of Contents

standalone selling price as adjusted for facts and circumstances applicable to
that contract. In these cases, we account for the additional products or
services as a separate contract. In other cases where the pricing in the
modification does not reflect the standalone selling price as adjusted for
facts and circumstances applicable to that contract, we account for the
additional products or services as part of the existing contract on a
prospective basis, on a cumulative catch-up basis, or a combination of both
based on the nature of the modification. In instances where the pricing in the
modification offers the customer a credit for a prior arrangement, we adjust
our variable consideration reserves for returns and other concessions.

Right of return. Certain contracts contain a right of return that allows the
customer to cancel all or a portion of the product or service and receive a
credit. We estimate returns based on historical returns data which is
constrained to an amount for which a material revenue reversal is not
probable. We do not recognize revenue for products or services that are
expected to be returned.

Practical expedient elected. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied
performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of
one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the
amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. For
contracts that were modified before the beginning of the earliest reporting
period presented, we have not retrospectively restated the contract for those
modifications. We have disclosed the aggregate effect of all modifications
when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations for
purposes of determining the transaction price and allocating the transaction
price at transition.

Research and development. Research and development expense consists primarily
of personnel costs for our engineers and third parties engaged in the design
and development of our products, software and technologies, including salary,
bonus and stock-based compensation expense, project material costs, services
and depreciation. Such costs are charged to research and development expense
as they are incurred.

Stock-based compensation expense. We recognize compensation expense for time-
based restricted stock units ("RSUs") using the straight-line amortization
method based on the fair value of RSUs on the date of grant. The fair value of
RSUs is the closing market price of Broadcom common stock on the date of
grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on
Broadcom common stock prior to vesting. We recognize compensation expense for
time-based stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights under the
Broadcom Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended ("ESPP") based on the
estimated grant-date fair value determined using the Black-Scholes valuation
model with a straight-line amortization method.

Certain equity awards include both service and market conditions. The fair
value of market-based awards is estimated on the date of grant using the Monte
Carlo simulation technique. Compensation expense for market-based awards is
amortized based upon a graded vesting method over the service period.

We estimate forfeitures expected to occur and recognize stock-based
compensation expense for such awards expected to vest. Changes in the
estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on stock-based
compensation expense since the effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in
the period the forfeiture estimate is changed.

Shipping and handling costs. Our shipping and handling costs charged to
customers are included in net revenue and the associated expense is included
in cost of revenue for all periods presented.

Litigation and settlement cost. We are involved in legal actions and other
matters arising in our recent business acquisitions and in the normal course
of business. We recognize an estimated loss contingency when the outcome is
probable prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statements and we are
able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any possible loss.

Income taxes. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability
method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in
the consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the
consolidated financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities
using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are
expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax
assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.

We recognize net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets
will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we
consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled
reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax
planning strategies and recent financial operations. If we determine that we
are able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of
their net carrying values, we adjust the valuation allowance and reduce the
provision for income taxes or increase the benefit from income taxes.
Likewise, if we determine that we are not able to realize all or part of our
net deferred tax assets, we increase the provision for income taxes or
decrease the benefit from income taxes in the period such determination is
made.

We account for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with the applicable
accounting guidance on income taxes. This guidance provides that a tax benefit
from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than
not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including
resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the
technical merits.

Net income per share. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net
income attributable to common stock by the weighted-average number of shares
of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is
computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock by the weighted-
average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive shares of
common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted shares outstanding include
the dilutive effect of unvested RSUs, in-the-money stock options, and ESPP
rights (together referred to as "equity awards"), as well as convertible
preferred stock. Potentially dilutive shares whose effect would have been
antidilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted net income per
share.

The dilutive effect of equity awards is calculated based on the average stock
price for each fiscal period, using the treasury stock method. Under the
treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock
options and purchasing shares under the ESPP and the amount of compensation
cost for future service that we have not yet recognized are collectively
assumed to be used to repurchase shares. The dilutive effect of convertible
preferred stock is calculated using the if-converted method. The if-converted
method assumes that these securities were converted at the beginning of the
reporting period to the extent that the effect is dilutive.

Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance. In October 2021, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2021-08,
Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract
Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. The new guidance requires contract
assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be
recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance
with Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers, as if it had originated the contracts. We early adopted this
guidance at the beginning of fiscal year 2022 and it did not materially impact
our consolidated financial statements.

3\. Revenue from Contracts with Customers

Disaggregation

We have considered (1) information that is regularly reviewed by our Chief
Executive Officer, who has been identified as the chief operating decision
maker (the "CODM") as defined by the authoritative guidance on segment
reporting, in evaluating financial performance and (2) disclosures presented
outside of our financial statements in our earnings releases and used in
investor presentations to disaggregate revenues. The principal category we use
to disaggregate revenues is the nature of our products and subscriptions and
services, as presented in our consolidated statements of operations. In
addition, revenues by reportable segment are presented in Note 13. "Segment
Information."

The following tables present revenue disaggregated by type of revenue and by
region for the periods presented:

_____________________________

(a) Subscriptions and services predominantly includes software licenses with
termination for convenience clauses.

Although we recognize revenue for the majority of our products when title and
control transfer in Penang, Malaysia, we disclose net revenue by region based
primarily on the geographic shipment location or delivery location specified
by our distributors, original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") customers,
contract manufacturers, channel partners, or software customers.

Contract Balances

Contract assets and contract liabilities balances were as follows:| | | | | |
| | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | October 30,  
2022| | October 31,  
2021

| (In millions)  
Contract Assets| | $| 128 | | | $| 126 |  
| | | |  
Contract Liabilities| | $| 3,341 | | | $| 3,185 |  
  
Changes in our contract assets and contract liabilities primarily result from
the timing difference between our performance and the customer's payment. We
fulfill our obligations under a contract with a customer by transferring
products and services in exchange for consideration from the customer. We
recognize a contract asset when we transfer products or services to a customer
and the right to consideration is conditional on something other than the
passage of time. Accounts receivable are recorded when the customer has been
billed or the right to consideration is unconditional. We recognize contract
liabilities when we have received consideration or an amount of consideration
is due from the customer and we have a future obligation to transfer products
or services. Contract liabilities include amounts billed or collected and
advanced payments on contracts or arrangements which may include termination
for convenience provisions. The amount of revenue recognized during fiscal
year 2022 that was included in the contract liabilities balance as of October
31, 2021 was $2,615 million. The amount of revenue recognized during fiscal
year 2021 that was included in the contract liabilities balance as of November
1, 2020 was $2,617 million.

Remaining Performance Obligations

Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents the
transaction price allocated to unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied
performance obligations. Remaining performance obligations include unearned
revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future
periods, but do not include contracts for software, subscriptions or services
where the customer is not committed. The customer is not considered committed
when termination for convenience without payment of a substantive penalty
exists, either contractually or through customary business practice. The
majority of our customer software contracts include termination for
convenience clauses without a substantive penalty and are not considered
committed. Additionally, as a practical expedient, we have not included
contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, nor have we
included contracts with sales-based or usage-based royalties promised in
exchange for a license of IP.

Certain multi-year customer contracts in our semiconductor solutions segment
contain firmly committed amounts and the remaining performance obligations
under these contracts as of October 30, 2022 were approximately $23.6 billion.
We expect approximately 28% of this amount to be recognized as revenue over
the next 12 months. Although the majority of our software contracts are not
deemed to be committed, our customers generally do not exercise their
termination for convenience rights. In addition, the majority of our contracts
for products, subscriptions and services have a duration of one year or less.
Accordingly, our remaining performance obligations disclosed above are not
indicative of revenue for future periods.

4\. Acquisitions

Pending Acquisition of VMware, Inc.

On May 26, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "VMware
Merger Agreement") to acquire all of the outstanding shares of VMware, Inc.
("VMware") in a cash-and-stock transaction (the "VMware Merger") that values
VMware at approximately $61 billion based on the closing price of Broadcom
common stock on May 25, 2022. We will also assume VMware's closing date
outstanding debt, net of expected cash.

Under the terms of the VMware Merger Agreement, each share of VMware common
stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
VMware Merger will be indirectly converted into the right to receive, at the
election of the holder of such share of VMware common stock, either $142.50 in
cash, without interest, or 0.2520 shares of Broadcom common stock. The
stockholder election will be subject to proration, such that the total number
of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive cash and the total number
of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive Broadcom common stock,
will, in each case, be equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of
VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time of the VMware Merger.

We will assume all outstanding VMware RSU awards and performance stock unit
awards held by continuing employees. The assumed awards will be converted into
RSU awards for shares of Broadcom common stock. All outstanding in-the-money
VMware stock options and RSU awards held by non-employee directors will be
accelerated and converted into the right to receive cash and shares of
Broadcom common stock, in equal parts.

Effective upon the effective time of the VMware Merger, one member of the
VMware Board of Directors, to be mutually agreed by us and VMware, will be
added to our Board of Directors.

In connection with the execution of the VMware Merger Agreement, we entered
into a commitment letter on May 26, 2022, with certain financial institutions
that committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions of the
commitment letter, a senior unsecured bridge facility in an aggregate
principal amount of $32 billion.

The VMware Merger, which is expected to be completed in our fiscal year ending
October 29, 2023 ("fiscal year 2023"), is subject to satisfaction or waiver of
customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the
waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976
and clearance under the antitrust laws of the European Union and certain other
jurisdictions. On October 3, 2022, we registered approximately 59 million
shares of our common stock. On November 4, 2022, VMware stockholders adopted
the VMware Merger Agreement. We and VMware each have termination rights under
the VMware Merger Agreement and, under specified circumstances, upon
termination of the agreement, we and VMware would be required to pay the other
a termination fee of $1.5 billion.

Acquisition of the Symantec Corporation Enterprise Security Business

On November 4, 2019 (the "Symantec Acquisition Date"), we completed the
purchase of the Symantec Business, which was an established leader in cyber
security, for $10.7 billion in cash. We acquired the Symantec Business to
expand our footprint of mission critical infrastructure software with our
existing customer base. The Symantec Business includes a deep and broad mix of
products, services and solutions, unifying cloud and on-premises security to
provide advanced threat protection and information protection across
endpoints, network, email and cloud applications. We financed this acquisition
with borrowings.

The following table presents our allocation of the total purchase price:

| | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | Fair Value  
| | (In millions)  
Current assets| | $| 273 |  
Goodwill| | 6,638 |  
Intangible assets| | 5,411 |  
Other long-term assets| | 92 |  
Total assets acquired| | 12,414 |  
Current liabilities| | (1,127)|  
Other long-term liabilities| | (587)|  
Total liabilities assumed| | (1,714)|  
Fair value of net assets acquired| | $| 10,700 |  
  
Goodwill is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce and anticipated
synergies and economies of scale expected from the integration of the Symantec
Business. The synergies include certain cost savings, operating efficiencies,
and other strategic benefits projected to be achieved resulting from the
acquisition of the Symantec Business. Substantially all goodwill is deductible
for tax purposes.

Current assets and current liabilities included amounts held-for-sale related
to the acquired Symantec Cyber Security Services business, which was not
aligned with our acquisition-date strategic objectives and was sold on April
30, 2020. We do not have any material continuing involvement with this
business and have presented its results in discontinued operations.

Our results of continuing operations for fiscal year 2020 included $1,610
million of net revenue attributable to the Symantec Business. It was
impracticable to determine the effect on net income attributable to the
Symantec Business as we had integrated the Symantec Business into our ongoing
operations during the year. The results of operations of the Symantec Business
were included in our infrastructure software segment. Transaction costs
related to the acquisition of the Symantec Business of $110 million were
included in selling, general and administrative expense for fiscal year 2020.

Intangible Assets

---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | Fair Value| | Weighted-Average Amortization Periods  
| | (In millions)| | (In years)

| | | |  
Total identified finite-lived intangible assets| | $| 5,411 | | |  
| | | |  
| | | |  
  
Developed technology relates to products used for cyber security solutions,
including data loss prevention, endpoint protection, and web, email and cloud
security solutions. We valued the developed technology using the multi-period
excess earnings method under the income approach. This method reflects the
present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated by
the developed technology less charges representing the contribution of other
assets to those cash flows. The economic useful life was determined based on
the technology cycle related to each developed technology, as well as the cash
flows over the forecast period.

Table of Contents

Customer contracts and related relationships represent the fair value of
future projected revenue that will be derived from sales of products to
existing customers of the Symantec Business. Customer contracts and related
relationships were valued using the with-and-without-method under the income
approach. In the with-and-without method, the fair value was measured by the
difference between the present values of the cash flows with and without the
existing customers in place over the period of time necessary to reacquire the
customers. The economic useful life was determined by evaluating many factors,
including the useful life of other intangible assets, the length of time
remaining on the acquired contracts and the historical customer turnover
rates.

Trade name relates to the "Symantec" trade name. The fair value was determined
by applying the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. This
method is based on the application of a royalty rate to forecasted revenue
under the trade name. The economic useful life was determined based on the
expected life of the trade name and the cash flows anticipated over the
forecast period.

Order backlog represents business under existing contractual obligations. The
fair value of backlog was determined using the multi-period excess earnings
method under the income approach based on expected operating cash flows from
future contractual revenue. The economic useful life was determined based on
the expected life of the backlog and the cash flows over the forecast period.

We believe the amounts of purchased intangible assets recorded above represent
the fair values of, and approximate the amounts a market participant would pay
for, these intangible assets as of the Symantec Acquisition Date.

Unaudited Pro Forma Information

The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents combined
results of operations for the period presented, as if we had completed the
acquisition of the Symantec Business as of the beginning of our fiscal year
ended November 3, 2019 ("fiscal year 2019"). The unaudited pro forma
information includes adjustments to amortization and depreciation for
intangible assets and property, plant and equipment acquired, adjustments to
interest expense for the additional indebtedness incurred to complete the
acquisition, restructuring charges related to the acquisition and transaction
costs. The unaudited pro forma information presented below is for
informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of our
consolidated results of operations of the combined business had the
acquisition actually occurred at the beginning of fiscal year 2019 or of the
results of our future operations of the combined business.

Other Acquisitions

During fiscal year 2022, we completed four acquisitions qualifying as business
combinations for total consideration of $245 million. For these acquisitions,
$164 million was allocated to goodwill and $110 million was allocated to
intangible assets, with additional amounts allocated to tangible assets and
liabilities, primarily within our infrastructure software segment.

During fiscal year 2020, we completed three other acquisitions qualifying as
business combinations for total consideration of $201 million. For these
acquisitions, $109 million was allocated to goodwill and $46 million was
allocated to intangible assets, with additional amounts allocated to tangible
assets and liabilities, primarily within our infrastructure software segment.

5\. Supplemental Financial Information

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents included $3,915 million and $4,668 million of time deposits
and $2,365 million and $1,607 million of money-market funds as of October 30,
2022 and October 31, 2021, respectively. For time deposits, carrying value
approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments. The
fair value of money-market funds, which was consistent with their carrying
value, was determined using unadjusted prices in active, accessible markets
for identical assets, and as such, they were classified as Level 1 assets in
the fair value hierarchy.

Accounts Receivable Factoring

We sell certain of our trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to
third-party financial institutions pursuant to factoring arrangements. We
account for these transactions as sales of receivables and present cash
proceeds as cash provided

by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Total
trade accounts receivable sold under the factoring arrangements were $3,700
million, $4,027 million and $3,723 million during fiscal years 2022, 2021 and
2020, respectively. Factoring fees for the sales of receivables were recorded
in other income (expense), net and were not material for any of the periods
presented.

6\. Leases

At the beginning of fiscal year 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases ("Topic
842") using the optional adoption method, whereby no adjustment to the
financial statements of comparative periods was required. We have operating
and finance leases for our facilities, data centers and certain equipment.
Operating lease expense was $98 million, $102 million and $106 million for
fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Finance lease expense was $18
million, $16 million and $14 million for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020
respectively.

9\. Retirement Plans

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

The U.S. defined benefit pension plans primarily consist of a qualified
pension plan. Benefits of the qualified pension plan are provided under an
adjusted career-average-pay program, a cash-balance program or a dollar-per-
month program. Benefit accruals under this plan were frozen in 2009.
Participants in the adjusted career-average-pay program no longer earn service
accruals. Participants in the cash-balance program no longer earn service
accruals, but continue to earn 4% interest per year on their cash-balance
accounts. There are no active participants under the dollar-per-month program.
We also have a non-qualified supplemental pension plan in the United States
that principally provides benefits based on compensation in excess of amounts
that can be considered under the qualified pension plan.

We also have defined benefit pension plans for certain employees in Austria,
France, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Japan and Taiwan. Eligibility is
generally determined based on the terms of our plans and local statutory
requirements.

Investment Policy

Plan assets of the U.S. qualified pension plan, which represent substantially
all of the plan assets, are generally invested in funds held by third-party
fund managers. Our benefit plan investment committee has set the investment
strategy to fully match the liability. We direct the overall portfolio
allocation and use a third-party investment consultant that has the discretion
to structure portfolios and select the investment managers within those
allocation parameters. Multiple investment managers are utilized, including
both active and passive management approaches. The plan assets are invested
using the liability-driven investment strategy intended to minimize market and
interest rate risks, and those assets are periodically rebalanced toward asset
allocation targets.

The target asset allocation for the U.S. qualified pension plan reflects a
risk/return profile that we believe is appropriate relative to the liability
structure and return goals for the plan. We periodically review the allocation
of plan assets relative to alternative allocation models to evaluate the need
for adjustments based on forecasted liabilities and plan liquidity needs. For
both fiscal years 2022 and 2021, 100% of the U.S. qualified pension plan
assets were allocated to fixed income, in line with the target allocation. The
fixed income allocation is primarily directed toward long-term core bond
investments, with smaller allocations to Treasury Inflation-Protected
Securities and high-yield bonds.

______________________________

(a)Cash equivalents primarily included short-term investment funds which
consisted of short-term money market instruments that were valued based on
quoted prices in active markets.

(b)These equity securities were valued based on quoted prices in active
markets.

(c)These amounts consisted of investments that were traded less frequently
than Level 1 securities and were valued using inputs that included quoted
prices for similar assets in active markets and inputs other than quoted
prices that were observable for the assets, such as interest rates, yield
curves, prepayment speeds, collateral performance, broker/dealer quotes and
indices that were observable at commonly quoted intervals.

Assumptions

The assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and net periodic
benefit cost for our defined benefit pension plans are presented in the table
below. The expected long-term return on assets shown in the table below
represents an estimate of long-term returns on investment portfolios primarily
consisting of combinations of debt, equity and other investments, depending on
the plan. The long-term rates of return are then weighted based on the asset
classes in which the pension funds are invested. Discount rates reflect the
current rate at which defined benefit pension obligations could be settled
based on the measurement dates of the plans, which is October 31, the month
end closest to our fiscal year end. The range of assumptions reflects the
different economic environments within various countries.

Defined Contribution Plans

Our eligible U.S. employees participate in a company-sponsored 401(k) plan.
Under the plan, we match employee contributions dollar for dollar up to 6% of
their eligible earnings. All matching contributions vest immediately. During
fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, we made contributions of $96 million, $94
million and $99 million, respectively, to the 401(k) plan.

In addition, other eligible employees outside of the U.S. receive retirement
benefits under various defined contribution retirement plans.

credit facility (the "Revolving Facility"), of which $500 million is available
for the issuance of multi-currency letters of credit. The issuance of letters
of credit and certain other instruments would reduce the aggregate amount
otherwise available under the Revolving Facility for revolving loans. Subject

repay and reborrow revolving loans at any time prior to the earlier of (a)
January 19, 2026 and (b) the date of termination in whole of the revolving

In February 2019, we established a commercial paper program pursuant to which
we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes ("Commercial Paper") in
principal amount of up to $2 billion outstanding at any time with maturities

customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at a discount
from par or, alternatively, may be sold at par and bear interest at rates
dictated by market conditions at the time of their issuance. The discount
associated with the Commercial Paper is amortized to interest expense over its
term. Outstanding Commercial Paper reduces the amount that would otherwise be
available to borrow for general corporate purposes under our revolving credit
facility. We had no Commercial Paper outstanding at either October 30, 2022 or

11\. Stockholders' Equity

Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock

On September 30, 2019, we completed an offering of approximately 4 million
shares of 8.00% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A, $0.001 par
value per share ("Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock"), which generated net
proceeds of approximately $3,679 million and would automatically convert into
shares of our common stock on September 30, 2022. At any time prior to
September 30, 2022, holders could elect to convert each share of Mandatory
Convertible Preferred Stock at the then minimum conversion rate. The
conversion rates were subject to anti-dilution adjustments.

The holders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock were entitled to receive,
when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, or an authorized committee
thereof, out of funds legally available for payment, cumulative dividends at
the annual rate of 8.00% of the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share
(equivalent to $80 annually per share), payable in cash or, subject to certain
limitations, by delivery of shares of our common stock or any combination of
cash and shares of our common stock, at our election; provided, however, that
any undeclared and unpaid dividends will continue to accumulate.

Subject to limited exceptions, no dividends may be declared or paid on shares
of our common stock, unless all accumulated dividends have been paid or set
aside for payment on all outstanding shares of our Mandatory Convertible
Preferred Stock for all past completed dividend periods. In the event of our
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, no
distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common stock until we
have paid to holders of our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock a
liquidation preference equal to $1,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid
dividends.

During fiscal year 2022, outstanding shares of our Mandatory Convertible
Preferred Stock converted into an aggregate of approximately 12 million shares
of our common stock at conversion rates ranging between 3.0894 and 3.1149
common shares per share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. We paid cash
in lieu of fractional shares of common stock upon conversion.

As of October 31, 2021, we recognized $27 million of accrued preferred stock
dividends, which was presented as temporary equity on our consolidated balance
sheet.

Stock Repurchase Program

In December 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program
to repurchase up to $10 billion of our common stock from time to time on or
prior to December 31, 2022. During fiscal year 2022, we repurchased and
retired approximately 12 million shares of our common stock for $7 billion
under this stock repurchase program.

In May 2022, our Board of Directors authorized another stock repurchase
program to repurchase up to an additional $10 billion of our common stock from
time to time through December 31, 2023.

Repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be effected through a
variety of methods, including open market or privately negotiated purchases.
The timing and amount of shares repurchased will depend on the stock price,
business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements,
alternative investment opportunities, acquisition opportunities, and other
factors. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific amount of shares of
common stock, and the stock repurchase programs may be suspended or terminated
at any time.

Equity Incentive Award Plan

2012 Plan

In connection with the acquisition of BRCM, we assumed the BRCM 2012 Stock
Incentive Plan (the "Original 2012 Plan") and outstanding unvested RSUs
originally granted by BRCM under the Original 2012 Plan that were held by
continuing employees. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, our
stockholders approved the amendment and restatement of the Original 2012 Plan,
now called Broadcom Inc. 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Amended 2012 Plan").
Under the Amended 2012 Plan, we may grant to employees stock options and stock
appreciation rights with an exercise price that is no less than the fair
market value on the date of grant, restricted stock awards and RSUs. No
participant may be granted such awards for more than an aggregate of 4 million
shares in any fiscal year. Equity awards granted under the Amended 2012 Plan
generally vest over four years. The Amended 2012 Plan reduced the number of
shares available for new equity award grants to 20 million shares and removed
the annual share replenishment provision provided under the Original 2012
Plan. Awards cancelled or forfeited and shares withheld to satisfy tax
withholding obligations become available for future issuance. As of October
30, 2022, 21 million shares remained available for issuance under the Amended
2012 Plan.

We may grant market-based RSUs with both a service condition and a market
condition as part of our equity compensation programs. The market-based RSUs
generally vest over four years, subject to satisfaction of market conditions.
During fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, we granted market-based RSUs under
which grantees may receive the number of shares ranging from 0% to 300% of the
original grant at vesting based upon the total stockholder return ("TSR") on
our common stock on an absolute basis and as compared to the TSR of an index
group of companies.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The ESPP provides eligible employees with the opportunity to acquire an
ownership interest in us through periodic payroll deductions, based on a
6-month look-back period, at a price equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair
market value of our common stock at either the beginning or the end of the
relevant offering period. The ESPP is structured as a qualified employee stock
purchase plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. However,
the ESPP is not intended to be a qualified pension, profit sharing or stock
bonus plan under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and is
not subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974.

recognize additional expense if actual forfeitures are lower than we
estimated, and will recognize a benefit if actual forfeitures are higher than
we estimated.

During the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, the Compensation Committee of
our Board of Directors approved a broad-based program of multi-year equity
grants of time- and market-based RSUs (the "Multi-Year Equity Awards") in lieu
of our annual employee equity awards historically granted on March 15 of each
year. Each Multi-Year Equity Award vests on the same basis as four annual
grants made March 15 of each year, beginning in fiscal year 2019, with
successive four-year vesting periods. Stock-based compensation expense related
to the Multi-Year Equity Awards was $794 million, $816 million and $902
million for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

As of October 30, 2022, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to
unvested stock-based awards was $2,704 million, which is expected to be
recognized over the remaining weighted-average service period of 2.7 years.

The following table summarizes the weighted-average assumptions utilized to
calculate the fair value of market-based awards granted in the periods
presented:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| |  
| | Fiscal Year  
| | 2022| | 2021| | 2020  
Risk-free interest rate| | 1.4 | %| | 0.3 | %| | 1.2 | %  
Dividend yield| | 2.7 | %| | 3.0 | %| | 4.7 | %  
Volatility| | 37.1 | %| | 39.0 | %| | 31.2 | %  
Expected term (in years)| | 3.4| | 3.4| | 4.0  
  
The risk-free interest rate was derived from the average U.S. Treasury Strips
rate, which approximated the rate in effect appropriate for the term at the
time of grant.

The dividend yield was based on the historical and expected dividend payouts
as of the respective award grant dates.

The volatility was based on our own historical stock price volatility over the
period commensurate with the expected life of the awards and the implied
volatility of a 180-day call option on our own common stock measured at a
specific date.

The expected term was commensurate with the awards' contractual terms.

years 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $4,207 million, $3,715 million, and $2,254
million, respectively, which represented the market value of our common stock
on the date that the RSUs vested. The number of RSUs vested included shares of
common stock that we withheld for settlement of employees' tax obligations due
upon the vesting of RSUs.

Stock Option Awards

As of October 30, 2022, our stock options outstanding were not material. The
aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised in fiscal years 2022,

The increase in provision for income taxes in fiscal year 2022 compared to
fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to higher income from continuing
operations.

The provision for income taxes in fiscal year 2021 compared to the benefit
from income taxes in fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to higher income from
continuing operations, offset in part by higher excess tax benefits from
stock-based awards. The benefit from income taxes in fiscal year 2020 was
primarily due to jurisdictional mix of income and expenses, discrete benefits
from the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in a
foreign jurisdiction, and excess tax benefits from stock-based awards.

Our tax incentives from the Singapore Economic Development Board provide that
any qualifying income earned in Singapore is subject to tax incentives or
reduced rates of Singapore income tax, subject to our compliance with the
conditions specified in these incentives and legislative developments. These
Singapore tax incentives are expected to expire in November 2025.

We have also obtained a tax holiday on our qualifying income in Malaysia,
which is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2028. The tax holiday that we
negotiated in Malaysia is also subject to our compliance with various
operating and other conditions. If we cannot, or elect not to, comply with any
such conditions specified, we will lose the related tax benefits and we could
be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits.

Before taking into consideration the effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
and other indirect tax impacts, the effect of these tax incentives and tax
holiday was to decrease the provision for income taxes by approximately $1,821
million and $1,156 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively, and
increase the benefit from income taxes by approximately $833 million for
fiscal year 2020.

We continue to indefinitely reinvest $2,112 million of certain accumulated
foreign earnings. The unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to
these earnings is estimated to be $222 million. All other current and future
earnings of all our foreign subsidiaries are not considered permanently
reinvested.

As of October 30, 2022, we had tax effected U.S. state net operating loss
carryforwards of $200 million and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of
$190 million, all of which expire in various years beginning fiscal year 2023.
We had $1,334 million of state research and development tax credits which
begin to expire in fiscal year 2023. We have provided a valuation allowance on
substantially all state tax credits and state and foreign net operating loss
carryforwards as we do not expect them to be realized.

Uncertain Tax Positions

We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits
within the provision for (benefit from) income taxes. Accrued interest and
penalties were included within other long-term liabilities. During fiscal
years 2022 and 2021, we recognized interest and penalties of $25 million and
$46 million, respectively, within the provision for income taxes. During
fiscal year 2020, we recognized interest and penalties of $37 million within
the benefit from income taxes. As of October 30, 2022 and October 31, 2021,
the combined amount of cumulative accrued interest and penalties was
approximately $411 million and $386 million, respectively.

Table of Contents

As of October 30, 2022 and October 31, 2021, approximately $5,528 million and
$5,416 million, respectively, of the unrecognized tax benefits and accrued
interest and penalties would, if recognized, benefit our effective income tax
rate. We are subject to U.S. income tax examination for fiscal years 2015 and
later. Certain of our acquired companies are subject to tax examinations in
major jurisdictions outside of the U.S. for fiscal years 2008 and later. It is
possible that our existing unrecognized tax benefits may change up to $163
million as a result of lapses of the statute of limitations for certain audit
periods and/or audit examinations expected to be completed within the next 12
months.

13\. Segment Information

Reportable Segments

We have two reportable segments: semiconductor solutions and infrastructure
software. Each segment has separate financial information that is utilized on
a regular basis by the CODM in determining how to allocate resources and
evaluate performance. The reportable segments are determined based on several
factors including, but not limited to, customer base, homogeneity of products,
technology, delivery channels and similar economic characteristics.

Semiconductor solutions. We provide semiconductor solutions for managing the
movement of data in data center, service provider, enterprise and embedded
networking applications. We provide a broad variety of radio frequency
semiconductor devices, wireless connectivity solutions, custom touch
controllers, and inductive charging solutions for mobile applications. We also
provide semiconductor solutions for enabling the set-top box and broadband
access markets and for enabling secure movement of digital data to and from
host machines, such as servers, personal computers and storage systems, to the
underlying storage devices, such as hard disk drives and solid state drives.
We also provide a broad variety of products for the general industrial and
automotive markets. Our semiconductor solutions segment also includes our IP
licensing.

Infrastructure software. We provide a portfolio of software solutions that
enables customers to plan, develop, automate, manage and secure applications
across mainframe, distributed, mobile and cloud platforms. Our portfolio of
infrastructure and security software is designed to modernize, optimize, and
secure the most complex hybrid environments, enabling scalability, agility,
automation, insights, resiliency and security. We also offer mission critical
FC SAN products and related software.

Our CODM assesses the performance of each segment and allocates resources to
each segment based on net revenue and operating results and does not evaluate
each segment using discrete asset information. Operating results by segment
include items that are directly attributable to each segment and also include
shared expenses such as marketing, general and administrative activities,
facilities and information technology ("IT") expenses. Shared expenses are
primarily allocated based on revenue, headcount or evenly between the
segments.

Unallocated Expenses

Unallocated expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible
assets, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring, impairment and
disposal charges, acquisition-related costs, and other costs, which are not
used in evaluating the results of, or in allocating resources to, our
segments. Acquisition-related costs include transaction costs and any costs
directly related to the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses.

Depreciation expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is
included in operating results for each segment. However, the CODM does not
evaluate depreciation expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not
separately presented. There was no inter-segment revenue for any of the
periods presented. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as
those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.

Geographic Information

Net revenue by country is based primarily on the geographic shipment or
delivery location as specified by the distributors, OEMs, contract
manufacturers, channel partners, or software customers who purchased our
products or services. For the majority of our products, title and control
transfer to our customers in Penang, Malaysia. The products are then
transported to the customer specific locations. Net revenue from the United
States for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $5,915 million, $5,285 million
and $4,778 million, respectively. Net revenue from China (including Hong Kong)
for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $11,637 million, $9,752 million and
$7,808 million, respectively. Net revenue from Singapore for fiscal years 2022
and 2021 was $4,003 million and $2,754 million, respectively (the amount was
less than 10% for fiscal year 2020). Net revenue from other foreign countries
for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $11,648 million, $9,659 million and
$11,302 million, respectively. These geographic delivery locations are not
necessarily indicative of the geographic location of our end customers or the
country in which our end customers sell devices containing our products. For
example, we believe a substantial portion of our products shipped or delivered
to China (including Hong Kong) is included in devices sold by our end
customers in the United States and Europe.

Long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and are based on the
physical location of the assets.

Significant Customer Information

We sell our products through our direct sales force and a select network of
distributors and channel partners globally. Two customers accounted for 15%
and 11% of our net accounts receivable balance as of October 30, 2022. No
customer accounted for more than 10% of our net accounts receivable balance as
of October 31, 2021. During fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, one customer
accounted for 20%, 18% and 13% of our net revenue, respectively. Revenue from
this customer was included in our semiconductor solutions segment.

Commitments

The following table summarizes contractual obligations and commitments as of
October 30, 2022:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Fiscal Year:| | Purchase Commitments| | Other Contractual Commitments

Thereafter| | 7 | | | 447 |  
Total| | $| 525 | | | $| 1,433 |  
  
Purchase Commitments. Represents unconditional purchase obligations that
include agreements to purchase goods or services, primarily inventory, that
are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant
terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum
or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction.
Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty.

Other Contractual Commitments. Represents amounts payable pursuant to
agreements related to IT, human resources, and other service agreements.

Due to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash
outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at October 30, 2022, we
are unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with the
respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $3,229 million of unrecognized tax
benefits and accrued interest and penalties classified within other long-term
liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of October 30, 2022 have been
excluded from the table above.

Contingencies

From time to time, we are involved in litigation that we believe is of the
type common to companies engaged in our lines of business, including
commercial disputes, employment issues, tax disputes and disputes involving
claims by third parties that our activities infringe their patent, copyright,
trademark or other IP rights, as well as regulatory investigations or
inquiries. Legal proceedings and regulatory investigations or inquiries are
often complex, may require the expenditure of significant funds and other
resources, and the outcome of such proceedings is inherently uncertain, with
material adverse outcomes possible. IP property claims generally involve the
demand by a third-party that we cease the manufacture, use or sale of the
allegedly infringing products, processes or technologies and/or pay
substantial damages or royalties for past, present and future use of the
allegedly infringing IP. Claims that our products or processes infringe or
misappropriate any third-party IP rights (including claims arising through our
contractual indemnification of our customers) often involve highly complex,
technical issues, the outcome of which is inherently uncertain. Moreover, from
time to time, we pursue litigation to assert our IP rights. Regardless of the
merit or resolution of any such litigation, complex IP litigation is generally
costly and diverts the efforts and attention of our management and technical
personnel.

Lawsuits Relating to California Institute of Technology

California Institute of Technology ("Caltech") filed a complaint against
Broadcom and Apple Inc. on May 26, 2016 in the United States District Court
for the Central District of California (the "U.S. Central District Court"),
and an amended complaint adding Cypress Semiconductor Corporation as a
defendant on August 15, 2016. The amended complaint alleged that chips that
support certain error correction codes as specified in IEEE Standards 802.11n
and 802.11ac willfully infringed four patents related to error correction
coding: U.S. Patent Nos. 7,116,710; 7,421,032; 7,916,781; and 8,284,833 ("'833
patent"). Prior to trial, Caltech dismissed its claims against Cypress and
withdrew its infringement allegations as to '833 patent. The complaint sought
a preliminary and permanent injunction, damages, pre- and post-judgment
interest, as well as attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses. The trial was held
in January 2020, and on January 29, 2020, the jury issued its verdict finding
infringement and awarding Caltech past damages of $270.2 million from Broadcom
and $837.8 million from Apple, for which Apple is seeking indemnification from
Broadcom. On August 3, 2020, the U.S. Central District Court issued its
judgment, awarding Caltech past damages in the amounts awarded by the jury, as
well as pre- and post-judgment interest. Additionally, the U.S. Central
District Court awarded Caltech an unspecified amount of ongoing royalties to
be determined after the anticipated appeals process is resolved. Neither the
jury nor the U.S. Central District Court found willful infringement, which if
it had, could have resulted in enhanced damages up to three times the amount
awarded. Broadcom and Apple appealed to the United States Court of

Table of Contents

Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the "Federal Circuit Court"). In February
2022, the Federal Circuit Court affirmed infringement of two patents, both of
which expired in August 2020, but it did not address all issues and ordered a
new trial on damages and on the infringement of the 7,916,781 patent, which
also expired in August 2020. In May 2022, the Federal Circuit Court denied the
petition for rehearing filed by Broadcom and Apple, and remanded the case to
the U.S. Central District Court. Subsequently, Caltech withdrew its
infringement allegations as to the 7,916,781 patent.

We believe that the evidence and the law do not support the U.S. Central
District Court's findings of infringement. We cannot reasonably estimate the
ultimate outcome as the Federal Circuit Court vacated the above damages, and a
number of factors (including a retrial at the lower court and further appeals)
could significantly change the assessment of damages. As a result, we have not
recorded a reserve with respect to this litigation, in accordance with the
applicable accounting standards.

Other Matters

In addition to the matters discussed above, we are currently engaged in a
number of legal actions in the ordinary course of our business.

Contingency Assessment

We do not believe, based on currently available facts and circumstances, that
the final outcome of any pending legal proceedings or ongoing regulatory
investigations, taken individually or as a whole, will have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated financial statements. However, lawsuits may involve
complex questions of fact and law and may require the expenditure of
significant funds and other resources to defend. The results of litigation or
regulatory investigations are inherently uncertain, and material adverse
outcomes are possible. From time to time, we may enter into confidential
discussions regarding the potential settlement of such lawsuits. Any
settlement of pending litigation could require us to incur substantial costs
and other ongoing expenses, such as future royalty payments in the case of an
IP dispute.

During the periods presented, no material amounts have been accrued or
disclosed in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect
to loss contingencies associated with any other legal proceedings or
regulatory investigations, as potential losses for such matters are not
considered probable and ranges of losses are not reasonably estimable. These
matters are subject to many uncertainties and the ultimate outcomes are not
predictable. There can be no assurances that the actual amounts required to
satisfy any liabilities arising from the matters described above will not have
a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Other Indemnifications

As is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the U.S.
and other jurisdictions, many of our standard contracts provide remedies to
our customers and others with whom we enter into contracts, such as defense,
settlement, or payment of judgment for IP claims related to the use of our
products. From time to time, we indemnify customers, as well as our suppliers,
contractors, lessors, lessees, companies that purchase our businesses or
assets and others with whom we enter into contracts, against combinations of
loss, expense, or liability arising from various triggering events related to
the sale and the use of our products, the use of their goods and services, the
use of facilities and state of our owned facilities, the state of the assets
and businesses that we sell and other matters covered by such contracts,
usually up to a specified maximum amount. In addition, from time to time we
also provide protection to these parties against claims related to
undiscovered liabilities, additional product liabilities or environmental
obligations. In our experience, claims made under such indemnifications are
rare and the associated estimated fair value of the liability is not material.

15\. Restructuring, Impairment and Disposal Charges

Restructuring Charges

From time to time, we initiate cost reduction activities to integrate acquired
businesses, to align our workforce with strategic business activities, or to
improve efficiencies in our operations. We recognized charges of $55 million,
$149 million and $233 million during fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020,
respectively. These charges were primarily recognized in operating expenses.

ITEM 9A.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO")
and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of October 30, 2022. The term
"disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a
company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files
or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including its principal executive and principal financial
officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in
evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
October 30, 2022, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of such date, our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance
level.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial
reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our
principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the
Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and
includes those policies and procedures that:

•pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets;

•provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that
receipts and expenditures of us are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors; and

•provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of October 30, 2022. In making this assessment, our
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as
of October 30, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting is
effective based on those criteria.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as of
October 30, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which
is included in Part II, Item 8\. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the
fourth quarter ended October 30, 2022 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting. Although we have modified our workplace practices globally due to
the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in some of our employees working remotely,
this has not meaningfully affected our internal controls over financial
reporting. We are continually monitoring and assessing the COVID-19 situation
on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their design and operating
effectiveness.
