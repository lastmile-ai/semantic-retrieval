ITEM 1. BUSINESS

OUR BUSINESSES

Overview

The terms "we," "our," "us," "its," "UnitedHealth Group," or the "Company"
used in this report refer to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and its
subsidiaries.

UnitedHealth Group Incorporated is a health care and well-being company with a
mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system
work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary business
platforms -- Optum and UnitedHealthcare -- are working to help build a modern,
high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes
and experiences for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to
serve.

The ability to analyze complex data and apply deep health care expertise and
insights allows us to serve people, care providers, businesses, communities
and governments with more innovative products and complete, end-to-end
offerings for many of the biggest challenges facing health care today.

Optum combines clinical expertise, technology and data to empower people,
partners and providers with the guidance and tools they need to achieve better
health. Optum serves the broad health care marketplace, including payers, care
providers, employers, governments, life sciences companies and consumers,
through its Optum Health, Optum Insight and Optum Rx businesses. These
businesses improve overall health system performance by optimizing care
quality and delivery, reducing costs and improving consumer and provider
experience, leveraging distinctive capabilities in data and analytics,
pharmacy care services, health care operations, population health and health
care delivery.

UnitedHealthcare offers a full range of health benefits, enabling affordable
coverage, simplifying the health care experience and delivering access to
high-quality care. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual serves employers
ranging from sole proprietorships to large, multi-site and national employers,
public sector employers and individual consumers. UnitedHealthcare Medicare &
Retirement delivers health and well-being benefits for Medicare beneficiaries
and retirees. UnitedHealthcare Community & State manages health care benefit
programs on behalf of state Medicaid and community programs and their
participants.

We have four reportable segments:

•Optum Health;

•Optum Insight;

•Optum Rx; and

•UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual,
UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community & State.

Optum

Optum is an information and technology-enabled health services business
serving the broad health care marketplace, including:

•Those who need care: consumers who need the right care, information,
resources, products and engagement to improve their health, achieve their
health goals and receive an improved patient experience that is personalized
and holistic and delivered in all care settings, including in-home and
virtually.

•Those who provide care: pharmacies, hospitals, physicians and other health
care facilities seeking to improve the health system and reduce the
administrative burden allowing for providers to focus time on patients leading
to the best possible patient care and experiences while achieving better
health outcomes at lower costs. Improved health outcomes are achieved by
leveraging our clinical expertise, data and analytics to better predict,
prevent and intercept consumers' health conditions and ensure they receive the
best evidence-based care.

•Those who pay for care: employers; health plans; and state, federal and
municipal agencies devoted to ensuring the people they sponsor receive high-
quality care, administered and delivered efficiently and effectively, all
while driving health equity so that every individual, family and community has
access to the care they need.

•Those who innovate for care: global life sciences organizations dedicated to
developing more effective approaches to care, enabling technologies and
medicines to improve care delivery and health outcomes.

Optum Health provides comprehensive and patient-centered care, addressing the
physical, mental, social, and financial well-being of 102 million consumers
and serves more than 100 health payer partners. We engage people in the most
appropriate care settings, including clinical sites, in-home and virtual.
Optum Health delivers primary, multi-specialty, behavioral, surgical and
urgent care; helps patients and providers navigate and address complex,
chronic and behavioral health needs; offers post-acute care planning services;
and serves consumers and care providers through advanced, on-demand digital
health technologies, such as telehealth and remote patient monitoring, and
innovative health care financial services. Optum Health works directly with
consumers, care delivery systems, providers, employers, payers, and public-
sector entities to provide high quality, accessible and equitable care with
improved health outcomes and reduced total cost of care.

Optum Health enables care providers to transition from traditional fee-for-
service payment models to performance-based delivery and payment models
designed to improve patient health outcomes and experience through value-based
care. Through strategic partnerships, alliances and ownership arrangements,
Optum Health helps care providers adopt new approaches and technologies
improving the coordination of care across providers to serve patients more
comprehensively.

Optum Health offerings include fully accountable value-based arrangements,
where Optum Health assumes responsibility for health care costs in exchange
for a monthly premium. Offerings also include administrative fee arrangements,
where Optum Health manages or administers products and services in exchange
for a monthly fee, and fee-for-service arrangements, where Optum Health
delivers health-related products and medical services for patients at a
contracted fee.

Optum Financial, including Optum Bank, serves consumers through nearly 20
million consumer accounts with nearly $20 billion in assets under management
as of December 31, 2022. Organizations across the health system rely on Optum
Financial to manage and improve payment flows through its highly automated,
scalable, end-to-end digital payment systems and integrated card solutions.
For financial services offerings, Optum Financial charges fees and earns
investment income on managed funds.

Optum Health sells its products primarily through its direct sales force,
strategic collaborations and external producers in three key areas: employers,
including large, mid-sized and small employers; payers including health plans,
third-party administrators (TPAs), underwriter/stop-loss carriers and
individual product intermediaries; and public entities including the U.S.
Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Veterans Affairs, Defense, and
other federal, state and local health care agencies.

Optum Insight

Optum Insight connects the health care system with services, analytics and
platforms that make clinical, administrative and financial processes simpler
and more efficient for all participants in the health care system. Hospital
systems, physicians, health plans, public entities, life sciences companies
and other organizations comprising the health care industry depend on Optum

UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides health and well-being services
to individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs.
UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement has distinct benefit designs, pricing,
underwriting, clinical program management and marketing capabilities dedicated
to health products and services in this market.

UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement offers a selection of products allowing
people choice in obtaining the health coverage and services they need as their
circumstances change. These offerings include care management and health
system navigator services, clinical management programs, nurse health line
services, 24-hour access to health care information, access to discounted
health services from a network of care providers and administrative services.

UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement has extensive distribution capabilities
and experience, including direct marketing to consumers on behalf of its key
clients, including AARP, the nation's largest membership organization
dedicated to the needs of people age 50 and over, and state and U.S.
government agencies. Products are also offered through agents, employer groups
and digital channels.

Major product categories include:

Medicare Advantage. Provides health care coverage for seniors and other
eligible Medicare beneficiaries through the Medicare Advantage program
administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), including
Medicare Advantage HMO plans, Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plans,
Point-of-Service plans, Private-Fee-for-Service plans and Special Needs Plans
(SNPs). Under the Medicare Advantage program, UnitedHealthcare Medicare &
Retirement provides health benefits coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly
premium per member from CMS plus, in some cases, monthly consumer premiums.
Premium amounts received from CMS vary based on the geographic areas in which
individuals reside; demographic factors such as age, gender and
institutionalized status; and the health status of the individual.
UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement served 7.1 million people through its
Medicare Advantage products as of December 31, 2022.

We have continued to enhance our offerings, focusing on more digital and
physical care resources in the home, expanding our concierge navigation
services and enabling the home as a safe and effective setting of care. For
example, through our HouseCalls program, nurse practitioners performed nearly
2.3 million clinical preventive home care visits in 2022 to address unmet care
opportunities and close gaps in care.

Medicare Part D. Provides Medicare Part D benefits to beneficiaries through
its Medicare Advantage and stand-alone Medicare Part D plans. The stand-alone
Medicare Part D plans address a large spectrum of people's needs and
preferences for their prescription drug coverage, including low-cost
prescription options. As of December 31, 2022, UnitedHealthcare enrolled 9.6
million people in the Medicare Part D programs, including 3.3 million
individuals in stand-alone Medicare Part D plans, with the remainder in
Medicare Advantage plans incorporating Medicare Part D coverage.

Table of Contents

Medicare Supplement. Provides a full range of supplemental products at diverse
price points. These products cover various levels of coinsurance and
deductible gaps to which seniors are exposed in the traditional Medicare
program. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement served 4.4 million seniors
nationwide through various Medicare Supplement products in association with
AARP as of December 31, 2022.

Premium revenues from CMS represented 38% of UnitedHealth Group's total
consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, most of which were
generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement.

UnitedHealthcare Community & State

UnitedHealthcare Community & State is dedicated to serving state programs
caring for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved and those
without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage, typically in
exchange for a monthly premium per member from the state program.
UnitedHealthcare Community & State's primary customers oversee Medicaid plans,
including Temporary Assistance to Needy Families; Children's Health Insurance
Programs (CHIP); Dual SNPs (DSNPs); Long-Term Services and Supports (LTSS);
Aged, Blind and Disabled; and other federal, state and community health care
programs. As of December 31, 2022, UnitedHealthcare Community & State
participated in programs in 35 states and the District of Columbia, and served
8.2 million people; including 1.5 million people through Medicaid expansion
programs in 19 states under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(ACA).

States using managed care services for Medicaid beneficiaries select health
plans by using a formal bid process or by awarding individual contracts. These
health plans and care programs are designed to address the complex needs of
the populations they serve, including the chronically ill, people with
disabilities and people with a higher risk of medical, behavioral and social
conditions. UnitedHealthcare Community & State administers benefits for the
unique needs of children, pregnant women, adults, seniors and those who are
institutionalized or are nursing home eligible. These individuals often live
in medically underserved areas and are less likely to have a consistent
relationship with the medical community or a care provider. They also often
face significant social and economic challenges.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Our businesses are subject to comprehensive U.S. federal and state and
international laws and regulations. We are regulated by agencies which
generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws
and rules. U.S. federal and state and international governments continue to
consider and enact various legislative and regulatory proposals which could
materially impact certain aspects of the health care system. New laws,
regulations and rules, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws,
regulations and rules, including as a result of changes in the political
environment, could adversely affect our businesses.

See Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" for a discussion of the risks related to
our compliance with U.S. federal and state and international laws and
regulations.

U.S. Federal Laws and Regulation

When we contract with the federal government, we are subject to federal laws
and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S.
government contracts. CMS regulates our UnitedHealthcare businesses and
certain aspects of our Optum businesses. Payments by CMS to our businesses are
subject to regulations, including those governing fee-for-service and the
submission of information relating to the health status of enrollees for
purposes of determining the amounts of certain payments to us. CMS also has
the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with CMS
contracts and regulations and the quality of care we provide to Medicare
beneficiaries. Our commercial business is further subject to CMS audits
related to medical loss ratios (MLRs) and risk adjustment data.

UnitedHealthcare Community & State has Medicaid and CHIP contracts, which are
subject to federal regulations regarding services to be provided to Medicaid
enrollees, payment for those services and other aspects of these programs.
There are many regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid compliance, and the
regulatory environment with respect to these programs is complex.

Our businesses are also subject to laws and regulations relating to consumer
protection, anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickbacks, false claims, prohibited
referrals, inappropriate reduction or limitation of health care services,
anti-money laundering, securities and antitrust compliance.

Privacy, Security and Data Standards Regulation. Certain of our operations are
subject to regulation under the administrative simplification provisions of
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended
(HIPAA), which apply to both the group and individual health insurance
markets, including self-funded employee benefit plans. Federal regulations
related to HIPAA contain minimum standards for electronic transactions and
code sets and for the privacy and security of protected health information.

* * *

Table of Contents

Our businesses must comply with the Health Information Technology for Economic
and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) which regulates matters relating to privacy,
security and data standards. HITECH imposes requirements on uses and
disclosures of health information; includes contracting requirements for HIPAA
business associate agreements; extends parts of HIPAA privacy and security
provisions to business associates; adds federal data breach notification
requirements for covered entities and business associates and reporting
requirements to HHS and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and, in some cases,
to the local media; strengthens enforcement and imposes higher financial
penalties for HIPAA violations and, in certain cases, imposes criminal
penalties for individuals, including employees. In the conduct of our
business, depending on the circumstances, we may act as either a covered
entity or a business associate.

The use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our
businesses are also regulated in some instances by other federal laws,
including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or state statutes implementing
GLBA. These federal laws and state statutes generally require insurers to
provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal health
and financial information is used and the opportunity to "opt out" of certain
disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third party, and
generally prescribe safeguards for the protection of personal information.
Neither the GLBA nor HIPAA privacy regulations preempt more stringent state
laws and regulations, which may apply to us, as discussed below. Federal
consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and
security practices related to personally identifiable information.

ERISA. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(ERISA), regulates how our services are provided to or through certain types
of employer-sponsored health benefit plans. ERISA is a set of laws and
regulations subject to interpretation by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) as
well as the federal courts. ERISA sets forth standards on how our business
units may do business with employers who sponsor employee health benefit
plans, particularly those who maintain self-funded plans. Regulations
established by the DOL subject us to additional requirements for
administration of benefits, claims payment and member appeals under health
care plans governed by ERISA.

State Laws and Regulation

Health Care Regulation. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by
the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. All of the states in which
our subsidiaries offer insurance and HMO products regulate those products and
operations. The states require periodic financial reports and establish
minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. The National
Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has adopted model regulations,
which require expanded governance practices and risk and solvency assessment
reporting. Most states have adopted these or similar measures to expand the
scope of regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control
activities of HMOs and insurance companies. We are required to maintain a risk
management framework and file a confidential self-assessment report with state
insurance regulators. We file reports annually with Connecticut, our lead
regulator, and with New York, as required by the state's regulation.

Our health plans and insurance companies are regulated under state insurance
holding company regulations. Such regulations generally require registration
with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports
describing capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain
affiliated transactions and general business operations. Most state insurance
holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of
acquisitions and material affiliated transfers of assets, as well as
transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding
companies or affiliates. These laws may restrict the ability of our regulated
subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding companies.

Some of our business activity is subject to other health care-related
regulations and requirements, including PPO, Managed Care Organization (MCO),
utilization review (UR), TPA, pharmacy care services, durable medical
equipment or care provider-related regulations and licensure requirements.
These regulations differ from state to state and may contain network,
contracting, product and rate, licensing and financial and reporting
requirements. Health care-related laws and regulations set specific standards
for delivery of services, appeals, grievances and payment of claims, adequacy
of health care professional networks, fraud prevention, protection of consumer
health information, pricing and underwriting practices and covered benefits
and services. State health care anti-fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a
wide range of activities, including kickbacks for referral of members, billing
for unnecessary medical services and improper marketing. Certain of our
businesses are subject to state general agent, broker and sales distribution
laws and regulations. UnitedHealthcare Community & State and certain of our
Optum businesses are subject to regulation by state Medicaid agencies which
oversee the provision of benefits to our Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries and
to our beneficiaries dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. We also
contract with state governmental entities and are subject to state laws and
regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of state
government contracts.

State Privacy and Security Regulations. A number of states have adopted laws
and regulations which may affect our privacy and security practices, such as
state laws governing the use, disclosure and protection of social security
numbers and protected health information or which are designed to implement
GLBA or protect credit card account data. State and local authorities
increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity
theft, with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses
to meet minimum cyber-security standards and notify individuals of security
breaches involving

personal information. State consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy
and security practices related to personally identifiable information,
including information related to consumers and care providers. Different
approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement
philosophies may materially and adversely affect our ability to standardize
our products and services across state lines. See Part I, Item 1A, "Risk
Factors" for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state
privacy and security regulations.

Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting Laws. Certain of our
businesses function as direct medical service providers and, as such, are
subject to additional laws and regulations. Some states have corporate
practice of medicine laws prohibiting specific types of entities from
practicing medicine or employing physicians to practice medicine. Moreover,
some states prohibit certain entities from engaging in fee-splitting
practices, which involve sharing in the fees or revenues of a professional
practice. These prohibitions may be statutory or regulatory, or may be imposed
through judicial or regulatory interpretation. The laws, regulations and
interpretations in certain states have been subject to limited judicial and
regulatory interpretation and are subject to change.

Pharmacy and Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Regulations

Optum Rx's businesses include home delivery, specialty and compounding
pharmacies, as well as clinic-based pharmacies which must be licensed as
pharmacies in the states in which they are located. Certain of our pharmacies
must also register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and
individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled
substances. In addition to adhering to the laws and regulations in the states
where our pharmacies are located, we also are required to comply with laws and
regulations in some non-resident states where we deliver pharmaceuticals,
including those requiring us to register with the board of pharmacy in the
non-resident state. These non-resident states generally expect our pharmacies
to follow the laws of the state in which the pharmacies are located, but some
non-resident states also require us to comply with their laws where
pharmaceuticals are delivered. Additionally, certain of our pharmacies which
participate in programs for Medicare and state Medicaid providers are required
to comply with applicable Medicare and Medicaid provider rules and
regulations. Other laws and regulations affecting our pharmacies include
federal and state statutes and regulations governing the labeling, packaging,
advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of
controlled substances. See Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" for a discussion of
the risks related to our pharmacy care services businesses.

Federal and state legislation regulating PBM activities affects both our
ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove network
providers. Additionally, many states limit our ability to manage and establish
maximum allowable costs for generic prescription drugs. With respect to
formulary services, a number of government entities, including CMS, HHS and
state departments of insurance, regulate the administration of prescription
drug benefits offered through federal or state exchanges. Many states also
regulate the scope of prescription drug coverage, as well as the delivery
channels to receive such prescriptions, for insurers, MCOs and Medicaid
managed care plans. These regulations could limit or preclude (i) certain plan
designs, (ii) limited networks, (iii) use of particular care providers or
distribution channels, (iv) copayment differentials among providers and (v)
formulary tiering practices.

Legislation seeking to regulate PBM activities introduced or enacted at the
federal or state level could impact our business practices with others in the
pharmacy supply chain, including pharmaceutical manufacturers and network
providers. In addition, organizations like the NAIC periodically issue model
regulations while credentialing organizations, like the National Committee for
Quality Assurance (NCQA) and the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission
(URAC), may establish standards impacting PBM pharmacy activities. Although
these model regulations and standards do not have the force of law, they may
influence states to adopt their recommendations and impact the services we
deliver to our clients.

Consumer Protection Laws

Certain of our businesses participate in direct-to-consumer activities and are
subject to regulations applicable to online communications and other general
consumer protection laws and regulations such as the Federal Tort Claims Act,
the Federal Postal Service Act and the FTC's Telemarketing Sales Rule. Most
states also have similar consumer protection laws.

Certain laws, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, give the FTC, the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and state attorneys general the
ability to regulate, and bring enforcement actions relating to, telemarketing
practices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone calls, texts
or emails. Under certain circumstances, these laws may provide consumers with
a private right of action. Violations of these laws could result in
substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions.

Banking Regulation

Optum Bank is subject to regulation by federal banking regulators, including
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which performs annual
examinations to ensure the bank is operating in accordance with federal safety
and soundness requirements, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,
which may perform periodic examinations to ensure the bank is

7

Table of Contents

in compliance with applicable consumer protection statutes, regulations and
agency guidelines. Optum Bank is also subject to supervision and regulation by
the Utah State Department of Financial Institutions, which carries out annual
examinations to ensure the bank is operating in accordance with state safety
and soundness requirements and performs periodic examinations of the bank's
compliance with applicable state banking statutes, regulations and agency
guidelines. In the event of unfavorable examination results from any of these
agencies, the bank could become subject to increased operational expenses and
capital requirements, enhanced governmental oversight and monetary penalties.

Non-U.S. Regulation

Certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to
regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct
business. These regulatory regimes vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In
addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws
regulating the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating
abroad, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits
offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value
to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise
secure a business advantage.

COMPETITION

As a diversified health care company, we operate in highly competitive markets
across the full expanse of health care benefits and services. Our competitors
include organizations ranging from startups to highly sophisticated Fortune 50
global enterprises, for-profit and non-profit companies, and private and
government-sponsored entities. New entrants to our markets and business
combinations among our competitors and suppliers also contribute to a dynamic
and competitive environment. We compete fundamentally on the quality and value
we provide to those we serve which can include elements such as product and
service innovation; use of technology; consumer and provider engagement and
satisfaction; and sales, marketing and pricing. See Part I, Item 1A, "Risk
Factors" for additional discussion of our risks related to competition.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

We have obtained trademark registration for the UnitedHealth Group, Optum and
UnitedHealthcare names and logos. We own registrations for certain of our
other trademarks in the United States and abroad. We hold a portfolio of
patents and have patent applications pending from time to time. We are not
substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents.

Unless otherwise noted, trademarks appearing in this report are trademarks
owned by us. We disclaim any proprietary interest in the marks and names of
others.

HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our nearly 400,000 employees, as of December 31, 2022, including more than
140,000 clinical professionals, are guided by our mission to help people live
healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our
mission and cultural values of integrity, compassion, relationships,
innovation and performance align with our long-term business strategy to
increase access to care, make care more affordable, enhance the care
experience, improve health outcomes and advance health equity. Our mission and
values attract individuals who are determined to make a difference -
individuals whose talent, innovation, engagement and empowerment are critical
in our ability to achieve our mission. Similar to other businesses, in 2022 we
experienced moderately higher levels of employment attrition, but due to
increased recruiting capacity, upgraded digital capabilities and continued
investment in our workforce, we continue to be able to meet the needs of those
we serve.

We are committed to developing our people and culture by creating an inclusive
environment where people of diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives
make us better. Our approach is data-driven and leader led and uses enterprise
and business scorecards to ensure our leaders are accountable for a consistent
focus on hiring, developing, advancing and retaining diverse talent. We have
embedded inclusion and diversity throughout our culture, including in our
talent acquisition and talent management practices; leadership development;
careers; learning and skills; and systems and processes. We strive to maintain
a sustainable and diverse talent pipeline by building strong strategic
partnerships and outreach through early career programs, internships and
apprenticeships. We support career coaching, mentorship and accelerated
leadership development programs to ensure mobility and advancement for our
diverse talent. To foster an engaged workforce and an inclusive culture, we
invest in a broad array of learning and culture development programs. We rely
on a shared leadership framework, which clearly and objectively defines our
expectations, enables an environment where everyone has the opportunity to
learn and grow, and helps us identify, develop and deploy talent to help
achieve our mission.

We prioritize pay equity by regularly evaluating and reviewing our
compensation practices by gender, ethnicity and race. Receiving on-going
feedback from our team members is another way to strengthen and reinforce a
culture of inclusion. Our Employee Experience Index measures an employee's
sense of commitment and belonging to our company and is a metric in the
Stewardship section of our annual incentive plan. Our Sustainability Report,
which can be accessed on our website at www.unitedhealthgroup.com, provides
further information about our people and culture.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS

The statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in
our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in
oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers,
the words "believe," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "anticipate," "forecast,"
"outlook," "plan," "project," "should" or similar words or phrases are
intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are
intended to take advantage of the "safe harbor" provisions of the PSLRA. These
forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our
actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied
in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement in this
report speaks only as of the date of this report and, except as required by
law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to
reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the
date of this report.

The following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our
business, which investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to
address in future filings or communications regarding our business or results
of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ
from discussions or information contained in previous filings or
communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have
affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future
results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form
10-K and in any other SEC filings or public statements we make may turn out to
be wrong. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate
assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many
factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results.
By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future
performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions
which are difficult to predict or quantify.

Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry

If we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs or set benefit
designs in an effective manner, the profitability of our risk-based products
and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our
results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

Through our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical
and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. We
generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the
costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability
of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for and
effectively manage medical costs. Our Optum Health business also enters into
fully accountable value-based arrangements with payers. Premium revenues from
risk-based products comprise nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues. If
we fail to predict accurately, or effectively price for or manage, the costs
of providing care under risk-based arrangements, our results of operations
could be materially and adversely affected.

We manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design,
negotiation of competitive provider contracts and care management programs.
Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services
rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Our
premium revenue on commercial policies and Medicaid contracts is typically
based on a fixed monthly rate per individual or family served for a 12-month
period and is generally priced one to six months before the contract
commences. Our revenue on certain Medicare policies is based on bids submitted
to CMS in June of the year before the contract year. Our premium revenue on
fully accountable value-based care products at Optum Health is typically based
on a fixed monthly rate per individual served. Although we base the
commercial, Medicaid and value-based premiums we charge and our Medicare bids
on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many
factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in
premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased
use of services, increased cost of individual services, costs to deliver care,
large-scale medical emergencies, the potential effects of climate change,
pandemics, the introduction of new or costly drugs, treatments and technology,
new treatment guidelines, newly mandated benefits or other regulatory changes
and insured population characteristics. For Optum Health's fully accountable
value-based care, our inability to provide higher-quality outcomes and better
experiences at lower costs or our

10

Table of Contents

inability to integrate our care delivery models could impact our results of
operations, financial positions and cash flows. Relatively small differences
between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a
percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial
results.

In addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include
estimates of costs incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These
estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove
inaccurate, our results of operations could be materially and adversely
affected.

If we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or
successfully consolidate, integrate, upgrade or expand our existing
information systems, or if our technology products do not operate as intended,
our business could be materially and adversely affected.

Our business depends on the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to
serve our members, customers and health care professionals and to operate our
business. If the data we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be
inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information
systems and data integrity effectively, we could experience failures in our
health, wellness and information technology products; lose existing customers;
have difficulty attracting new customers; experience problems in determining
medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing; have difficulty
preventing, detecting and controlling fraud; have disputes with customers,
physicians and other health care professionals; become subject to regulatory
sanctions, penalties, investigations or audits; incur increases in operating
expenses; or suffer other adverse consequences.

The volume of health care data generated, and the uses of data, including
electronic health records, are rapidly expanding. Our ability to implement new
and innovative services, automate and deploy new technologies to simplify
administrative processes and clinical decision making, price our products and
services adequately, provide effective service to our customers and consumers
in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, provide timely payments to care
providers, and report accurately our results of operations depends on the
integrity of the data in our information systems. In addition, connectivity
among technologies is becoming increasingly important and recent trends toward
greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced
technologies, including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices.
Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources
to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to
keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology,
evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences.

We periodically consolidate, integrate, upgrade and expand our information
systems' capabilities as a result of technology initiatives, recently enacted
regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business
acquisitions. Our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate,
upgrading and expanding our information systems' capabilities, enhancing our
systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in
information processing technology may not be successful. Failure to protect,
consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than
expected costs and diversion of management's time and energy, which could
materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position
and cash flows.

Certain of our businesses sell and install software products which may contain
unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during
installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer. A
failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless
fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results
of operations, financial position and cash flows.

Uncertain and rapidly evolving U.S. federal and state, non-U.S. and
international laws and regulations related to health data and the health
information technology market may alter the competitive landscape or present
compliance challenges and could materially and adversely affect the
configuration of our information systems and platforms, and our ability to
compete in this market.

If we or third parties we rely on sustain cyber-attacks or other privacy or
data security incidents resulting in security breaches disrupting our
operations or resulting in the unintended dissemination of protected personal
information or proprietary or confidential information, we could suffer a loss
of revenue and increased costs, exposure to significant liability,
reputational harm and other serious negative consequences.

We routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data in our
operations, including protected personal information subject to privacy,
security or data breach notification laws, as well as proprietary or
confidential information relating to our business or third parties. Some of
the data we process, store and transmit may be outside of the United States
due to our information technology systems and international business
operations. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber-attacks and other
security threats and may be subject to breaches of the information technology
systems we use. We have programs in place to detect, contain and respond to
data security incidents and provide employee awareness training regarding
phishing, malware and other cyber risks to protect against cyber risks and
security breaches. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized
access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and
are increasing in

11

* * *

Table of Contents

sophistication, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, detect
breaches for long periods of time or implement adequate preventive measures.
Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our
security controls and access, misappropriate or otherwise compromise protected
personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of
third parties, create system disruptions or cause system shutdowns, negatively
affecting our operations. They also may be able to develop and deploy viruses,
worms and other malicious software programs attacking our systems or otherwise
exploit any security vulnerabilities. Hardware, software, or applications we
develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or
manufacture or other problems which could unexpectedly compromise information
security. Our facilities and services may also be vulnerable to security
incidents or security attacks; acts of vandalism or theft; coordinated attacks
by activist entities; financial fraud schemes; misplaced or lost data; human
error; malicious social engineering; or other events which could negatively
affect our systems, our customers' data, proprietary or confidential
information relating to our business or third parties, or our operations.
Moreover, there has been an increase in new financial fraud schemes and
ransomware attacks on large companies, whereby cybercriminals install
malicious software preventing users or the enterprise from accessing computer
files, systems or networks and demand payment of a ransom for return of
access. In addition, there may be a heightened vulnerability due to the lack
of physical supervision and on-site infrastructure for remote workforce
operations. In certain circumstances we may rely on third-party vendors to
process, store and transmit large amounts of data for our business whose
operations are subject to similar risks.

The costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and
vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be material. We have
business continuation and resiliency plans which are maintained, updated and
tested regularly in an effort to ensure successful containment and remediation
of potential disruptions or cyber events. In the event that our remediation
efforts may not be successful, it could result in interruptions, delays, or
cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. In addition,
breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of
sensitive personal information, proprietary information or confidential
information about us or our customers or other third parties, could expose our
customers' private information and our customers to the risk of financial or
medical identity theft, or expose us or other third parties to a risk of loss
or misuse of this information, result in litigation and liability, including
regulatory penalties, for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise
harm our business.

If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share,
including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health
benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could
be materially and adversely affected.

Our businesses face significant competition in all of the geographic markets
in which we operate. In particular geographies or product segments, our
competitors, compared to us, may have greater capabilities, resources or
market share; a more established reputation; superior supplier or health care
professional arrangements; better existing business relationships; lower
profit margin or financial return expectations; or other factors which give
such competitors a competitive advantage. Our competitive position may also be
adversely affected by significant merger and acquisition activity in the
industries in which we operate, both among our competitors and suppliers.
Consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our
customer base, improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers,
or maintain or increase profitability.

In addition, our success in the health care marketplace depends on our ability
to develop and deliver innovative and potentially disruptive products and
services to satisfy evolving market demands. If we do not continue to innovate
and provide products and services, which are useful and relevant to health
care payers, consumers and our customers, we may not remain competitive and
risk losing market share to existing competitors and disruptive new market
entrants. For example, new direct-to-consumer business models from competing
businesses may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers in
the selection and management of their health care benefits and health care
usage. We may face challenges from new technologies and market entrants which
could affect our existing relationship with health plan enrollees in these
areas. Any failure by us to continue to develop innovative care models,
including accelerating the transition of care to value-based models achieving
higher quality outcomes and better experiences at lower costs and expanding
access to virtual and in-home care, could result in competitive disadvantages
and loss of market share. Additionally, our competitive position could be
adversely affected by a failure to develop satisfactory data and analytics
capabilities or provide services focused on these capabilities to our clients.
Our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows also
could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in
our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive
markets, if we do not design and price our products properly and
competitively, if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services
demonstrating value to our customers, if we do not provide a satisfactory
level of services, if membership or demand for other services does not
increase as we expect or declines, or if we lose accounts with more profitable
products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less
profitable products. The expected resumption of Medicaid redeterminations may
also impact our ability to maintain market share if we are unable to retain or
add new consumers to other benefit offerings.

If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care
payers, physicians, hospitals and other service providers, our business could
be materially and adversely affected.

We depend substantially on our continued ability to contract with health care
payers (as a service provider to those payers), as well as physicians,
hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical
manufacturers and other service providers at competitive prices. If we fail to
develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers,
whether in-network or out-of-network, it could materially and adversely affect
our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In
addition, certain activities related to network design, provider participation
in networks and provider payments could result in disputes, which may be
costly, divert management's attention from our operations and result in
negative publicity.

In any particular market, physicians and health care providers could refuse to
contract with us, demand higher payments, or take other actions which could
result in higher medical costs, less desirable products for customers or
difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets,
certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician and hospital
organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market
positions or near monopolies which could diminish our bargaining power. In
addition, Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs); physician group management
services organizations (which aggregate physician practices for administrative
efficiency); and other organizational structures adopted by physicians,
hospitals and other care providers may change the way in which these providers
do business with us and may change the competitive landscape. Such
organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us, which
could adversely affect our business, and our results of operations, financial
position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or
affecting the way we price our products and estimate our costs, which might
require us to incur costs to change our operations. In addition, if these
providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate
favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to
market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and
adversely affected.

Our health care benefits businesses have risk-based arrangements with some
physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. These arrangements
limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to
risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of
the health care provider. To the extent a risk-based health care provider
organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform
its obligations under the arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid
health care claims which should have been the responsibility of the health
care provider and for which we have already paid the provider. Further,
payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with
whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the
provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available
to our members. Health care providers with which we contract may not properly
manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes
with other providers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect
on the provision of services to our members and our operations.

Some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with
us. In some instances, those providers may dispute the payment for these
services and may institute litigation or arbitration.

The success of some of our businesses, including Optum Health and
UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual's international operations, depends on
maintaining satisfactory relationships with physicians as our employees,
independent contractors or joint venture partners. The physicians who practice
medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could
terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to
continue practicing medicine or contracting with us. We face and will likely
continue to face heightened competition to acquire or manage physician
practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians. If we are
unable to maintain or grow satisfactory relationships with physicians, or to
acquire, recruit or, in some instances, employ physicians, or to retain
enrollees following the departure of a physician, our revenues could be
materially and adversely affected. In addition, our affiliated physician
organizations contract with competitors of UnitedHealthcare. Our businesses
could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain
relationships with these companies, or fail to adequately price their
contracts with these third-party payers.

Further, physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers,
pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers
of our Optum businesses. Physicians also provide medical services at
facilities owned by our Optum businesses. Given the importance of health care
providers and other constituents to our businesses, failure to maintain
satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our
results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

We are routinely subject to various legal actions, which could damage our
reputation and, if resolved unfavorably, could result in substantial penalties
or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of
operations, financial position and cash flows.

We are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to, among
other matters, the design, management and delivery of our product and service
offerings. Any failure by us to adhere to the laws and regulations applicable
to our businesses could subject us to civil and criminal penalties.

Legal actions to which we are a party have included or in the future could
include matters related to health care benefits coverage and payment of claims
(including disputes with enrollees, customers and contracted and non-
contracted physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals), tort
claims (including claims related to the delivery of health care services, such
as medical malpractice by staff at our affiliates' facilities, or by health
care practitioners who are employed by us, have contractual relationships with
us, or serve as providers to our managed care networks, including as a result
of a failure to adhere to applicable clinical, quality and/or patient safety
standards), antitrust claims (including as a result of changes in the
enforcement of antitrust laws), whistleblower claims (including claims under
the False Claims Act or similar statutes), contract and labor disputes, tax
claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. In
addition, certain of our pharmacy services operations are subject to clinical
quality, patient safety and other risks inherent in the dispensing, packaging
and distribution of drugs, including claims related to purported dispensing
and other operational errors. We may also be party to certain class action
lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers. We operate
in jurisdictions outside of the United States where contractual rights, tax
positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or
uncertainty to a greater degree than in the United States, and therefore
subject to dispute by customers, government authorities or others.

We are largely self-insured with regard to litigation risks, including claims
of medical malpractice against our affiliated physicians and us. Although we
record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from
self-insured matters, it is possible the level of actual losses will
significantly exceed the liabilities recorded. Additionally, physicians and
other healthcare providers have become subject to an increasing number of
legal actions alleging medical malpractice and general professional
liabilities. Even in states that have imposed caps on damages for such
actions, litigants are seeking recoveries under new theories of liability that
might not be subject to the caps on damages. These actions involve significant
defense costs and could result in substantial monetary damages or damage to
our reputation.

We cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are
involved. We incur expenses to resolve these matters and current and future
legal actions could further increase our cost of doing business and materially
and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash
flows. Moreover, certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity which
could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to
retain our current business or grow our market share in some markets and
businesses.

If we fail to successfully manage our strategic alliances, to complete, manage
or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions or
relationships domestically or outside the United States it could materially
and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial
position and cash flows.

As part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with
third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures,
strategic alliances, joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often
enter into agreements relating to such transactions. For example, we have a
strategic alliance with AARP under which we provide AARP-branded Medicare
Supplement insurance to AARP members and other AARP-branded products and
services to Medicare beneficiaries. If we fail to meet the needs of our
alliance or joint venture partners, including by developing additional
products and services, providing high levels of service, pricing our products
and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and
state regulatory changes, our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or
terminated, which in turn could adversely impact our reputation, business and
results of operations. Further, governmental actions, such as actions by the
FTC or DOJ, may affect our ability to complete our merger and acquisition
transactions, which could adversely affect our future growth. If we fail to
identify and successfully complete transactions to meet our strategic
objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and
technology internally, be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be
adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or
cash flows.

Successful acquisitions are also dependent on effectively integrating the
acquired business into our existing operations, including our internal control
environment and culture, or otherwise leveraging its operations which may
present challenges different from those presented by organic growth and may be
difficult for us to manage. In addition, even with appropriate diligence, pre-
acquisition practices of an acquired business may expose us to legal
challenges and investigations. For example, in January 2021, an indictment for
alleged violations of antitrust laws was issued by the DOJ against our
subsidiary, Surgical Care Affiliates (SCA), based on conduct alleged to have
begun more than five years prior to our acquisition of SCA. We are vigorously
defending this lawsuit, but if SCA is found liable, we may be subject to
criminal fines or reputational harm. If we

14

cannot successfully integrate our acquired businesses and realize contemplated
revenue growth opportunities, cost savings and other synergies, our business,
prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be
materially and adversely affected.

As we expand and operate our business outside of the United States, we are
presented with challenges differing from those presented by acquisitions of
domestic businesses, including challenges in adapting to new markets,
languages, business, labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments.
Adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior
management attention and other resources to the acquired businesses before we
realize anticipated synergies or other benefits from those businesses. These
challenges vary widely by country and, outside of the United States, may
include political instability, government intervention, discriminatory
regulation and currency exchange controls or other restrictions, which could
prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries
in which our acquired businesses operate, or converting local currencies we
hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies. If we are unable to manage
successfully our non-U.S. acquisitions, our business, prospects, results of
operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected.

Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our
shareholders' equity from period to period, which could adversely affect our
debt to debt-plus-equity ratio, and our future revenues, costs and cash flows
from international operations. Any measures we may implement to reduce the
effect of volatile currencies may be costly or ineffective.

We are subject to risks associated with public health crises arising from
large-scale medical emergencies, pandemics, natural disasters and other
extreme events, which have and could have an adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition and financial performance.

Large-scale medical emergencies, pandemics (such as COVID-19) and other
extreme events could result in public health crises or otherwise have a
material adverse effect on our business operations, cash flows, financial
conditions and results of operations. For example, disruptions in public and
private infrastructure resulting from such events could increase our operating
costs and ability to provide services to our clients and customers.
Additionally, as a result of these events, the premiums and fees we charge may
not be sufficient to cover our medical and administrative costs, deferred
medical care could be sought in future periods at potentially higher acuity
levels, we could experience reduced demand for our services, our clinical and
non-clinical workforce could be impacted resulting in reduced capacity to
handle demand for care or otherwise impact our business operations. For
example, COVID-19 has materially impacted our results of operations in
previous periods. Public health crises arising from natural disasters, such as
wildfires, hurricanes, and snowstorms, or effects of climate change could
impact our business operations and result in increased medical care costs.
Government enaction of emergency powers in response to public health crises
could disrupt our business operations, including by restricting
pharmaceuticals or other supplies, and could increase the risk of shortages of
necessary items.

Our sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract, retain and
provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants.

Our products and services are sold in part through nonexclusive producers and
consultants and we compete for their services and allegiance. Our sales could
be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain and
support independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not
appropriately aligned across distribution channels. Our relationships with
producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our
business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these
pressures, including potential reductions in commission levels.

Unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our
revenues and our results of operations.

Unfavorable economic conditions may impact demand for certain of our products
and services. Unfavorable economic conditions also have caused and could
continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as
an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-
funded basis to reduce their operating costs. In addition, unfavorable
economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or
result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services.
These conditions could lead to a decrease in people served and premium and fee
revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations,
financial position and cash flows.

During a prolonged unfavorable economic environment, state and federal budgets
could be materially and adversely affected, resulting in reduced
reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care
coverage programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP. A reduction in state
Medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retroactively to apply to
payments already negotiated or received from the government and could
materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position
and cash flows. In addition, state and federal budgetary pressures could cause
the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or
assessments for our commercial programs, such as premium taxes on health
insurance and surcharges or fees on select fee-for-service and capitated
medical claims. Any of these developments or actions could materially and
adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

A prolonged unfavorable economic environment could also adversely impact the
financial position of hospitals and other care providers which could
materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and
increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to
purchase our service offerings. Further, unfavorable economic conditions could
adversely impact the customers of our Optum businesses, including health
plans, hospitals, care providers, employers and others which could, in turn,
materially and adversely affect Optum's financial results.

Our failure to attract, develop, retain, and manage the succession of key
employees and executives could adversely affect our business, results of
operations and future performance.

We are dependent on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified
employees and executives, including those with diverse backgrounds,
experiences and skills, to operate and expand our business. If we are unable
to attract, develop, retain and effectively manage the development and
succession plans for key employees and executives, our business, results of
operations and future performance could be adversely affected. Experienced and
highly skilled employees and executives in the health care and technology
industries are in high demand and the market for their services is extremely
competitive. We may have difficulty in replacing key executives because of the
limited number of qualified individuals in these industries with the breadth
of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand our
business. Adverse changes to our corporate culture, which seeks to foster
integrity, compassion, relationships, innovation and performance, could harm
our business operations and our ability to retain key employees and
executives. While we have development and succession plans in place for our
key employees and executives, these plans do not guarantee that the services
of our key employees and executives will continue to be available to us.

Our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could adversely affect our
results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

Market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position.
Volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value
of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities which constitute
the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of December 31,
2022. In addition, a delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers, or
defaults by issuers (primarily issuers of our investments in corporate and
municipal bonds), could reduce our investment income and require us to write
down the value of our investments which could adversely affect our
profitability and equity.

Our investments may not produce total positive returns and we may sell
investments at prices which are less than their carrying values. Changes in
the value of our investment assets, as a result of interest rate fluctuations,
changes in issuer financial or market conditions, illiquidity or otherwise,
could have an adverse effect on our equity. In addition, if it should become
necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated
basis, such an action could have an adverse effect on our results of
operations and the capital position of our regulated subsidiaries.

If the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired, our results of
operations, equity and credit ratings could be materially and adversely
affected.

As of December 31, 2022, our goodwill and other intangible assets had a
carrying value of $108 billion, representing 44% of our total consolidated
assets. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to
determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired,
in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. The value of our goodwill
may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses we acquire perform in a
manner inconsistent with our assumptions. In addition, from time to time we
divest businesses, and any such divestiture could result in significant asset
impairment and disposition charges, including those related to goodwill and
other intangible assets. Any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our
goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our
results of operations and equity in the period in which the impairment occurs.
A material decrease in equity could, in turn, adversely affect our credit
ratings.

If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases,
software and related products, our ability to market our knowledge and
information-related businesses could be hindered and our results of
operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and
adversely affected.

We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with
employees and third parties, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and
patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and
precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information.
In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights
exists in the software industry, and we expect software products to be
increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of
products and competitors in this industry segment grows. Such litigation and
misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to
market and sell products and services which could materially and adversely
affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

Any downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Claims paying ability, financial strength and debt ratings by nationally
recognized statistical rating organizations are important factors in
establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings
information is broadly disseminated and generally used by customers and
creditors. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings
are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers.
Our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings.
Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically. Our
ratings reflect each credit rating agency's opinion of our financial strength,
operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations
to policyholders. We may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings in
the future. Any downgrades in our credit ratings could materially increase our
costs of or ability to access funds in the debt capital markets and otherwise
materially increase our operating costs.

Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Business

Our business activities in the United States and other countries are highly
regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or
regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely
affect our business.

We are regulated by federal, state and local governments in the United States
and other countries where we do business. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries
must be licensed by and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in
which they conduct business. For example, states require periodic financial
reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements.
Health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance
holding company regulations and some of our activities may be subject to other
health care-related regulations and requirements, including regulations and
licensure requirements related to PPOs, MCOs, UR and TPAs. Under state
guaranty association laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to
prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants
of impaired or insolvent insurance companies which write the same line or
similar lines of business. Any such assessment could expose our insurance
entities and other insurers to the risk they would be required to pay a
portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance company's claims through state
guaranty associations.

Certain of our businesses provide products or services to government agencies.
For example, some of our Optum and UnitedHealthcare businesses hold government
contracts or provide services related to government contracts and are subject
to U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. self-referral, anti-kickback, medical
necessity, risk adjustment, false claims and other laws and regulations
governing government contractors and the use of government funds. Our
relationships with these government agencies are subject to the terms of our
contracts with the agencies and to laws and regulations regarding government
contracts. Among others, certain laws and regulations restrict or prohibit
companies from performing work for government agencies which might be viewed
as an actual or potential conflict of interest. These laws may limit our
ability to pursue and perform certain types of engagements, thereby materially
and adversely affecting our results of operations, financial position and cash
flows.

Certain of our Optum businesses are also subject to regulations distinct from
those faced by our insurance and HMO subsidiaries, some of which could impact
our relationships with physicians, hospitals and customers. These regulations
include state telemedicine regulations; debt collection laws; banking
regulations; distributor and producer licensing requirements; state corporate
practice of medicine doctrines; fee-splitting rules; and health care facility
licensure and certificate of need requirements. These risks and uncertainties
may materially and adversely affect our ability to market or provide our
products and services, or to achieve targeted operating margins, or may
increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate.

The laws and rules governing our businesses and interpretations of those laws
and rules are subject to frequent change. For example, legislative,
administrative and public policy changes to the ACA have been and likely will
continue to be considered, and we cannot predict if the ACA will be further
modified. Litigation challenges have been brought seeking to invalidate the
ACA in whole or in part and future litigation challenges are possible.
Further, the integration of entities we acquire into our businesses may affect
the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us, including by subjecting
us to laws and rules which did not previously apply to us. The broad latitude
given to the agencies administering, interpreting and enforcing current and
future regulations governing our businesses could force us to change how we do
business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and
administrative costs and capital requirements, or expose us to increased
liability in courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and
other actions.

We also must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our
products and services, increase prices for certain regulated products and
services and complete certain acquisitions and dispositions or integrate
certain acquisitions. For example, premium rates for our health insurance and
managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many
states and by the federal government. Additionally, we must submit data on
proposed rate increases to HHS on many of our products for monitoring
purposes. Geographic and product expansions of our businesses may be subject
to state and federal regulatory approvals. Delays in obtaining necessary
approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could
materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position
and cash flows.

We currently operate outside of the United States and in the future may
acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the United States,
increasing our exposure to non-U.S. regulatory regimes. Our failure to comply
with U.S. or non-U.S. laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the
United States or to establish constructive relations with non-U.S. regulators
could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services or to
do so at targeted operating margins, which may have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Non-U.S.
regulatory regimes, which vary by jurisdiction, encompass, among other
matters, local and cross-border taxation, licensing, tariffs, intellectual
property, investment, capital (including minimum solvency margin and reserve
requirements), management control, labor, anti-fraud, anti-corruption and
privacy and data protection regulations (including requirements for cross-
border data transfers). For example, our UnitedHealthcare Employer &
Individual international business subjects us to Brazilian laws and
regulations affecting hospitals, managed care and insurance industries and to
regulation by Brazilian regulators, including the national regulatory agency
for private health insurance and plans, the Agencia Nacional de Saude
Suplementar, while our Banmedica business is subject to Chilean, Colombian and
Peruvian laws, regulations and regulators applicable to hospitals and private
insurance. Any international regulator may take an approach to the
interpretation, implementation and enforcement of industry regulations which
could differ from the approach taken by U.S. regulators. In addition, our
non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws regulating the
conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the
FCPA, which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to
give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain
business or otherwise secure a business advantage.

The health care industry is regularly subject to negative publicity, including
as a result of governmental investigations, adverse media coverage and
political debate surrounding industry regulation. Negative publicity may
adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets.

As a result of our participation in various government health care programs,
both as a payer and as a service provider to payers, we are exposed to
additional risks associated with program funding, enrollments, payment
adjustments, audits and government investigations which could materially and
adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and
cash flows.

We participate in various federal, state and local government health care
benefit programs, including as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D,
various Medicaid programs and CHIP, and receive substantial revenues from
these programs. Certain of our Optum businesses also provide services to
payers participating in government health care programs. A reduction or less
than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these
programs or change in allocation methodologies, or termination of the contract
at the option of the government, may materially and adversely affect our
results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

The government health care programs in which we participate generally are
subject to frequent changes, including changes which may reduce the number of
persons enrolled or eligible for coverage, reduce the amount of reimbursement
or payment levels, reduce our participation in certain service areas or
markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs.
Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal
government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding
through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs
depends on many factors outside of our control, including general economic
conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level.
For example, CMS has in the past reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage
benchmarks and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are possible.
In addition, from time to time, CMS makes changes to the way it calculates
Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments. Although we have adjusted
members' benefits and premiums on a selective basis, ceased to offer benefit
plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost
management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding
pressures, these or other strategies may not fully address the funding
pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. In addition, payers in the
Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS
as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit.
States have also made changes in rates and reimbursements for Medicaid members
and audits can result in unexpected recoupments.

Under the Medicaid managed care program, state Medicaid agencies solicit bids
from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care
Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of
state Medicaid managed care contracts, we risk losing the members who were
enrolled in those Medicaid plans. Under the Medicare Part D program, to
qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result
in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the
government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is
not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-
assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. In
general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment,
utilization, medical costs and other factors. If any of these assumptions is
materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs
on which we bid, implementation of material program or policy changes after
our bid submission, or submission by our competitors at lower rates than our
bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be
materially and adversely affected.

Table of Contents

Many of the government health care coverage programs we participate in are
subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance
standards or benchmarks. For example, as part of the ACA, CMS has a system
providing various quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans meeting
certain quality star ratings at the individual plan or local contract level.
The star rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including,
among others, quality of care, preventive services, chronic illness
management, handling of appeals and customer satisfaction. Plans must have a
rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments. If we do not
maintain or continue to improve our star ratings, our plans may not be
eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our
revenues and the benefits our plans can offer, which could materially and
adversely affect the marketability of our plans, number of people we serve,
and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Any changes
in standards or care delivery models applying to government health care
programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or our inability to improve our
quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or
to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our
participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs, which
in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations,
financial position and cash flows.

CMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for Medicare programs,
including adjustment of monthly capitation payments to Medicare Advantage
plans and Medicare Part D plans according to the predicted health status of
each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers for Medicare
Advantage plans, as well as, for Medicare Part D plans, risk-sharing
provisions based on a comparison of costs forecasted in our annual bids to
actual prescription drug costs. Some state Medicaid programs utilize a similar
process. For example, our UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and
UnitedHealthcare Community & State businesses submit information relating to
the health status of enrollees to CMS or state agencies for purposes of
determining the amount of certain payments to us. CMS and the Office of
Inspector General for HHS periodically perform risk adjustment data validation
(RADV) audits of selected Medicare health plans to validate the coding
practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers.
Certain of our local plans have been selected for such audits, which in the
past have resulted and in the future could result in retrospective adjustments
to payments made to our health plans, fines, corrective action plans or other
adverse action by CMS.

We have been involved, and in the future may become involved in routine,
regular and special governmental investigations, audits, reviews and
assessments. Such investigations, audits, reviews or assessments sometimes
arise out of, or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers who,
among other allegations, may claim we failed to disclose certain business
practices or, as a government contractor, submitted false or erroneous claims
to the government. Governmental investigations, audits, reviews and
assessments could lead to government actions, which have resulted in, and in
the future could result in, adverse publicity, the assessment of damages,
civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including
restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or
exclusion from participation in government programs, any of which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
position and cash flows.

Our pharmacy care services businesses face regulatory and operational risks
and uncertainties which may differ from the risks of our other businesses.

We provide pharmacy care services through our Optum Rx and UnitedHealthcare
businesses. Each business is subject to federal and state anti-kickback,
beneficiary inducement and other laws governing the relationships of the
business with pharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies, customers
and consumers. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider
new regulations for the industry which could materially affect current
industry practices, including potential new legislation and regulations
regarding the receipt or disclosure of rebates and other fees from
pharmaceutical companies, the development and use of formularies and other
utilization management tools, the use of average wholesale prices or other
pricing benchmarks, pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals, limited access to
networks and pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies. Further, various
governmental agencies have conducted and continue to conduct investigations
and studies into certain PBM practices, which have resulted and may result in
PBMs agreeing to civil penalties, including the payment of money and entry
into corporate integrity agreements, or could materially and adversely impact
the PBM business model. As a provider of pharmacy benefit management services,
Optum Rx is also subject to an increasing number of licensure, registration
and other laws and accreditation standards. Optum Rx conducts business through
home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies, pharmacies located in
community mental health centers and home infusion, which subjects it to
extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those of
the DEA and individual state controlled substance authorities, the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) and Boards of Pharmacy.

We could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our home
delivery, specialty or compounding or clinic-based pharmacies or the provision
of home infusion services, claims related to the inherent risks in the
packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products.
Disruptions from any of our home delivery, specialty pharmacy or home infusion
services could materially and adversely affect our results of operations,
financial position and cash flows.

In addition, our pharmacy care services businesses provide services to
sponsors of health benefit plans subject to ERISA. A private party or the DOL,
which is the agency that enforces ERISA, could assert the fiduciary
obligations imposed by the

statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pharmacy care
services businesses even where those businesses are not contractually
obligated to assume fiduciary obligations. If a court were to determine such
fiduciary obligations apply, we could be subject to claims for breaches of
fiduciary obligations or claims we entered into certain prohibited
transactions.

If we fail to comply with applicable privacy, security and data laws,
regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service
providers utilizing protected personal information on our behalf, our
business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows
could be materially and adversely affected.

The collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and
disposal of protected personal information are regulated at the federal,
state, international and industry levels and addressed in requirements imposed
on us by contracts with customers. These laws, rules and requirements are
subject to change. Compliance with new privacy and security laws, regulations
and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or
require us to alter our business model or operations.

Internationally, many of the jurisdictions in which we operate have
established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we
or our customers must comply. We expect there will continue to be new proposed
laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection
and information security in the European Union, Brazil, Chile, India and other
jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impacts such future laws,
regulations and standards may have on our businesses or the businesses of our
customers. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) imposes more stringent European Union data protection
requirements on us or our customers, and prescribes greater penalties for
noncompliance. Brazilian privacy legislation, similar in certain respects to
GDPR, took effect in September 2020.

Many of our businesses are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data
Security Standard, which is a multifaceted security standard designed to
protect payment card account data.

HIPAA requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with
certain privacy and security requirements. While we provide for appropriate
protections through our contracts with our third-party service providers and
in certain cases assess their security controls, we have limited oversight or
control over their actions and practices. Several of our businesses act as
business associates to their covered entity customers and, as a result,
collect, use, disclose and maintain protected personal information in order to
provide services to these customers. HHS administers its audit program to
assess HIPAA compliance efforts by covered entities and business associates.
An audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and
cash flows.

Through our Optum businesses, we maintain a database of administrative and
clinical data statistically de-identified in accordance with HIPAA standards.
Noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations
or requirements, or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving
the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of protected
personal information, whether by us or by one of our third-party service
providers, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business
and, among other consequences, could subject us to mandatory disclosure to the
media, loss of existing or new customers, significant increases in the cost of
managing and remediating privacy or security incidents, and material fines,
penalties and litigation awards. Any of these consequences could have a
material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position
and cash flows.

Restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our regulated subsidiaries
could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial
position and cash flows.

Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent on dividends and
administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund our
obligations. Many of these subsidiaries are regulated by state departments of
insurance or similar regulatory authorities. We are also required by law or
regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these
subsidiaries. The levels of capitalization required depend primarily on the
volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary. In most
states, we are required to seek approval by state regulatory authorities
before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries
exceeding specified amounts. An inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay
dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of
our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business
through capital expenditures or business acquisitions, as well as our ability
to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment, repurchase shares of our
common stock and repay our debt. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds
from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our results of operations,
financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

General

UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health care company with a mission to help
people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for
everyone. Our two complementary businesses -- Optum and UnitedHealthcare --
are driven by this unified mission and vision to improve health care access,
affordability, experiences and outcomes for the individuals and organizations
we are privileged to serve.

We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, Optum and
UnitedHealthcare:

•Optum Health;

•Optum Insight;

•Optum Rx; and

•UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual,
UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community & State.

Further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in
Part I, Item 1, "Business" and in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data."

Business Trends

Our businesses participate in the United States, South America and certain
other international health markets. In the United States, health care spending
has grown consistently for many years and comprises 18% of gross domestic
product (GDP). We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow
in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical
advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and
national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be
affected by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, which
could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to
control health care costs.

Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefits, products and services, we
start with our view of expected future costs, including inflation and labor
market dynamics. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the
local markets we serve, considering relevant factors, such as product
positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative
and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio (MLR)
thresholds and similar revenue adjustments. We will continue seeking to
balance growth and profitability across all these dimensions.

The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in the small group,
large group and individual segments. We expect broad-based competition to
continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs.

Medicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in
"Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties."

In Medicaid, we believe the payment rate environment creates the risk of
continued downward pressure on Medicaid margin percentages. We continue to
take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and
maintenance of existing relationships. We continue to advocate for actuarially
sound rates commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated
to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability
of their programs.

Table of Contents

Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in
unit costs; care activity; and prescription drug costs. We endeavor to
mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information
and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping
them achieve high-quality, affordable care.

Medicaid Redeterminations. In December 2022, Congress passed the 2023 Omnibus
Appropriations bill that allows states to resume Medicaid redeterminations
beginning in April 2023. Redeterminations will result in a decline in people
served through our Medicaid business and an expected increase in people served
through our commercial and exchange-based offerings as we endeavor to ensure
that people have continued access to benefits.

Delivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market continues to
change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both
payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being
called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care
quality and patient experience, improve the health of populations and reduce
costs. We are working to accelerate this vision through the innovation and
integration of our care delivery models including in clinic, in-home,
behavioral and virtual care, and by using our data and analytics to provide
clinicians with the necessary information in order to provide the best
possible care in the most cost efficient setting. We continue to see a greater
number of people enrolled in fully accountable value-based plans rewarding
high-quality, affordable care and fostering collaboration.

This trend is creating needs for health management services which can
coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care
channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information
and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our
Optum business platform.

Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties

Following is a summary of management's view of the trends and uncertainties
related to regulatory matters. For additional information regarding regulatory
trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 "Business - Government
Regulation" and Item 1A, "Risk Factors."

Medicare Advantage Rates. Medicare Advantage rate notices over the years have
at times resulted in industry base rates well below industry forward medical
trend. For example, the February 2023 Advance Notice for 2024 rates would
result in an industry base rate decrease, well short of what is an increasing
industry forward medical cost trend, creating continued pressure in the
Medicare Advantage program. Further, proposed substantial revisions to the
risk adjustment model, which serves to adjust rates to reflect a patient's
health status and care resource needs, would result in reduced funding and
benefits for people, especially those with some of the greatest health and
social challenges.

  

As a result of ongoing Medicare funding pressures, there are adjustments we
can make to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions for a
particular period. For example, we can seek to intensify our medical and
operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our
care provider networks, adjust member benefits and implement or increase the
member premiums supplementing the monthly payments we receive from the
government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where
we will offer Medicare Advantage plans.

SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE ITEMS

2022 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2021 RESULTS

Consolidated Financial Results

Revenues

The increases in revenues were primarily driven by growth in the number of
people served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, pricing trends and
growth across the Optum businesses.

Medical Costs and MCR

Medical costs increased due to growth in people served. The MCR decreased due
to COVID-19 effects, partially offset by decreased prior years favorable
development and business mix.

Operating Cost Ratio

The operating cost ratio decreased primarily due to productivity gains,
partially offset by investments and business mix.

Medicare Advantage increased due to growth in people served through individual
and group Medicare Advantage plans. The increase in people served through
Medicaid was primarily driven by states continuing to ease redetermination
requirements and growth in people served through Dual Special Needs Plans.

UnitedHealthcare's revenues increased due to growth in the number of people
served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid. Earnings from operations
increased due to growth in people served and COVID-19 effects, partially
offset by decreased prior years favorable development.

Optum

Total revenues and earnings from operations increased due to growth across the
Optum businesses. The results by segment were as follows:

Optum Health

Revenues at Optum Health increased primarily due to organic growth in patients
served under value-based care arrangements and business combinations. Earnings
from operations increased due to organic growth in the number of people served
under value-based care arrangements, cost management initiatives, asset
dispositions and COVID-19 effects. Optum Health served approximately 102
million people as of December 31, 2022 compared to 100 million people as of
December 31, 2021.

Optum Insight

Revenues and earnings from operations at Optum Insight increased due to growth
in technology and managed services, with managed services revenue growth
driven by business combinations and new health system partnerships.

Optum Rx

Revenues and earnings from operations at Optum Rx increased due to higher
script volumes from growth in people served, increased utilization and organic
growth in pharmacy care services, including community health, specialty and
home delivery pharmacies. Earnings from operations also increased as a result
of continued supply chain management initiatives. Optum Rx fulfilled 1,438
million and 1,368 million adjusted scripts in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Liquidity

Introduction

We manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall
business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments,
working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and
long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity
and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are
principally from earnings before noncash expenses.

Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and
are subject to, among other things, minimum levels of statutory capital, as
defined by their respective jurisdictions, and restrictions on the timing and
amount of dividends paid to their parent companies.

Our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $8.8
billion and $8.0 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note 10 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8,
"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further detail concerning
our regulated subsidiary dividends.

Our nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from
operations available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these
entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing
through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper
or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further
strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to
expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through
capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our shareholders
through dividends and repurchases of our common stock.

2022 Cash Flows Compared to 2021 Cash Flows

Increased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by
changes in working capital accounts and increased net earnings. Other
significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included
increased net issuances of long-term debt, customer funds administered,
primarily driven by Medicare Part D timing and increased HSA deposits, cash
received for dispositions and decreased purchases of redeemable noncontrolling
interests, partially offset by increased cash paid for acquisitions, net
purchases of investments and common stock repurchases.

Financial Condition

As of December 31, 2022, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt
securities and equity securities balances of $69.4 billion included $23.4
billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $1.3 billion was available for
general corporate use), $42.3 billion of debt securities and $3.7 billion of
equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash
equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of
our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital
position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and
our commercial paper program, which is fully supported by our bank credit
facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market
conditions. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for
further detail concerning our fair value measurements.

Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 4.0
years and a weighted-average credit rating of "Double A" as of December 31,
2022. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security,
the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average
credit rating.

Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity

Cash Requirements. The Company's cash requirements within the next twelve
months include medical costs payable, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities, short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt,
other current liabilities, and purchase commitments and other obligations. We
expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated
through cash flows from current operations; cash available for general
corporate use; and the realization of current assets, such as accounts
receivable.

Our long-term cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and
commitments include:

•Debt obligations. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data" for further detail of our long-term debt and the timing of
expected future payments. Interest coupon payments are typically paid semi-
annually.

•Operating leases. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data" for further detail of our obligations and the timing of
expected future payments.

•Purchase and other obligations. These include $5.6 billion, $2.9 billion of
which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months, of fixed or
minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and
services, including agreements cancelable with the payment of an early
termination penalty, and remaining capital commitments for venture capital
funds and other funding commitments. These amounts exclude agreements
cancelable without penalty and liabilities to the extent recorded in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022.

•Other liabilities. These include other long-term liabilities reflected in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022, including obligations
associated with certain employee benefit programs, unrecognized tax benefits
and various long-term liabilities, which have some inherent uncertainty in the
timing of these payments.

•Redeemable noncontrolling interests. See Note 2 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data" for further detail. We do not have any
material expected redemptions in the next twelve months.

We expect the cash required to meet our long-term obligations to be primarily
generated through future cash flows from operations. However, we also have the
ability to generate cash to satisfy both our current and long-term
requirements through the issuance of commercial paper, issuance of long-term
debt, or drawing under our committed credit facilities or the ability to sell
investments. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future,
short-term and long-term, liquidity needs.

Short-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity
support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the
private placement of senior unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers,
and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our
commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data."

Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including
covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders'
equity ratio of not more than 60%, subject to increase in certain
circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement. As of December 31,
2022, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders' equity ratio, as defined and
calculated under the credit facilities, was 38%.

Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets to issue long-term
debt for general corporate purposes, such as to meet our working capital
requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share
repurchases. For more information on our debt, see Note 8 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 "Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data."

Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of December 31, 2022 were as follows: |
| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

Stable  
Commercial paper| P-2| | n/a| | A-1| | n/a| | F1| | n/a| | AMB-1+| | n/a  
  
The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by
many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels,
credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory
requirements and economic and market conditions. A significant downgrade in
our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase
the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital.

Share Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2022, we had Board of Directors'
authorization to purchase up to 31 million shares of our common stock. For
more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 10 of the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data."

Dividends. In June 2022, the Company's Board of Directors increased the
Company's quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $6.60
compared to $5.80 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 10
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II,
Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

Pending Acquisitions. As of December 31, 2022, we have entered into agreements
to acquire companies in the health care sector, most notably, LHC Group, Inc.
(NASDAQ: LHCG), subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing
conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions,
excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $9 billion. We
completed the acquisition of LHC Group, Inc. on February 22, 2023.

We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments
requiring cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to
expand our operations, which include internal development of new products,
programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Critical accounting estimates are those estimates requiring management to make
challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate
the effects of matters inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent
periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties
which are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different
results under different assumptions and conditions.

Medical Costs Payable

Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations
for medical care services rendered on behalf of consumers, but for which
claims have either not yet been received or processed. Depending on the health
care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services
can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Approximately 90% of claims
related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the
date of service.

In each reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more
completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with
previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical
costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical
costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate
of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will
increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable
development). Medical costs in 2022, 2021 and 2020 included favorable medical
cost development related to prior years of $410 million, $1.7 billion and $880
million, respectively.

In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different
estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being
estimated. For example, for the most recent two months, we estimate claim
costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average
per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which
more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term
completion factors.

Completion Factors. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon
historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of
incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by us at the date of
estimation. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in
developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most
recent two months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim
submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim
levels and processing cycles, as well as other factors. If actual claims
submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of
factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions),
actual care activity incurred (which can be influenced by pandemics or
seasonal illnesses, such as influenza), or our claim processing patterns are
different than estimated, our reserve estimates may be significantly impacted.

Table of Contents

The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the
estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those
periods as of December 31, 2022: | | | | | | | |

Medical Cost Per Member Per Month Trend Factors. Medical cost PMPM trend
factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable
estimates for the most recent two months. Medical cost trend factors are
developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months,
provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and a review of a
broad set of health care utilization indicators. These factors include but are
not limited to pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital authorization
data and seasonal and other incidence data from the National Centers for
Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth,
employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the
medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and
practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix
of services utilized; mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays
and deductibles; changes in medical practices; and catastrophes, epidemics and
pandemics.

The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the
estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most
recent two months as of December 31, 2022: | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Medical Cost PMPM Quarterly Trend  
Increase (Decrease) in Factors| | Increase (Decrease)

1| | 328 |  
(1)| | (328)|  
(2)| | (656)|  
(3)| | (985)|  
  
The completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above
include outcomes considered reasonably likely based on our historical
experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit
claims.

Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and
adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2022;
however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as
discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December
31, 2022 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable,
excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting
impact from premium rebates, 2022 net earnings would have increased or
decreased by approximately $215 million.

For more detail related to our medical cost estimates, see Note 2 of the Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8,
"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

Goodwill

We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event
occurs or circumstances change indicating the carrying value may not be
recoverable. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may first assess
qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying
value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. During a
qualitative analysis, we consider the impact of changes, if any, to the
following factors: macroeconomic, industry and market factors; cost factors;
changes in overall financial performance; and any other relevant events and
uncertainties impacting a reporting unit. If our qualitative assessment
indicates a goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform additional
quantitative analyses. We may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and
proceed directly to the quantitative testing. For reporting units where a
quantitative analysis is performed, we perform a test measuring the fair
values of the reporting units and comparing them to their carrying values,
including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the
reporting unit, an impairment is recognized for the difference, up to the
carrying amount of goodwill.

31

* * *

Table of Contents

We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a discounted cash
flow method which includes assumptions about a wide variety of internal and
external factors. Significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow
method include financial projections of free cash flow, including revenue
trends, medical costs trends, operating productivity, income taxes and capital
levels; long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the
discretely forecasted periods; and discount rates. For each reporting unit,
comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our
discounted cash flow test.

Financial projections and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units
are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan
and strategies. Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and
include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. Our
most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our
adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital reflecting
reporting unit-specific factors. We have not made any adjustments to decrease
a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of
capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates
are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage
of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of
uncertainty with respect to the reporting units' operations could cause these
assumptions to change in the future. Additionally, as part of our quantitative
impairment testing, we perform various sensitivity analyses on certain key
assumptions, such as discount rates and cash flow projections to analyze the
potential for a material impact. As of October 1, 2022, we completed our
annual impairment tests for goodwill with all of our reporting units having
fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values.

LEGAL MATTERS

A description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 12 of Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data."

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and
accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our
investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy
authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts which may
be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S.
government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate
debt obligations of investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with
respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer
groups and other customers constituting our client base. As of December 31,
2022, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates impacting
our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of
our fixed-rate investments and debt, as well as foreign currency exchange rate
risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian real and Chilean peso.

As of December 31, 2022, we had $31 billion of financial assets on which the
interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may
significantly impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2022, $16
billion of our financial liabilities, which include debt and deposit
liabilities, were at interest rates which vary with market rates, either
directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts.

The fair value of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market
interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, $38 billion of our investments were
fixed-rate debt securities and $43 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-
rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market
value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in
market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and
fixed-rate debt.

We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across
different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as
by matching a portion of our floating-rate assets and liabilities, either
directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains
and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported
in comprehensive income.

The following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market
interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of

Note: The impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates may not reflect the
full 100 or 200 basis point change on interest income and interest expense or
on the fair value of financial assets and liabilities as the rates are assumed
to not fall below zero.

We have an exposure to changes in the value of foreign currencies, primarily
the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso, to the U.S. dollar in translation of
UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual's international business operating
results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period, and assets
and liabilities at the exchange rate at the end of the accounting period. The
gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into
U.S. dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income.

An appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real or Chilean peso
reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in those currencies.
For example, as of December 31, 2022, a hypothetical 10% and 25% increase in
the value of the U.S. dollar against those currencies would have caused a
reduction in net assets of approximately $560 million and $1.2 billion,
respectively. We manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk primarily
by conducting our international business operations in their functional
currencies.

As of December 31, 2022, we had $3.7 billion of investments in equity

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of UnitedHealth Group
Incorporated and Subsidiaries:

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of UnitedHealth
Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022
and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive
income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred
to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria
established in Internal Control -- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the
Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the
current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or
required to be communicated to the Audit and Finance Committee and that (1)
relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex
judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any
way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not,
by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion
on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it
relates.

Incurred but not Reported (IBNR) Claim Liability - Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to
the financial statements.

Critical Audit Matter Description

Medical costs payable includes estimates of the Company's obligations for
medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers, for which
claims have either not yet been received or processed. These estimates are
referred to as incurred but not reported (IBNR) claim liabilities. At December
31, 2022, the Company's IBNR balance was $20 billion. The Company develops
IBNR estimates using an actuarial model that requires management to exercise
certain judgments in developing its estimates. Judgments made by management
include medical cost per member per month trend factors and completion
factors, which include assumptions over the time from date of service to claim
receipt, the impact of actual care activity, and processing cycles.

We identified the IBNR claim liability as a critical audit matter because of
the significant assumptions made by management in estimating the liability.
This required complex auditor judgment, and an increased extent of effort,
including the involvement of actuarial specialists in performing procedures to
evaluate the reasonableness of management's methods, assumptions and judgments
in developing the liability.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures included the following, among others:

•We tested the effectiveness of controls over management's estimate of the
IBNR claim liability balance, including controls over the judgments in both
the completion factors and the medical cost per member per month trend
factors, as well as controls over the claims and membership data used in the
estimation process.

•We tested the underlying claims and membership data and other information
that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, to test that the inputs
to the actuarial estimate were complete and accurate.

•With the assistance of actuarial specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness
of the actuarial methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the
IBNR claim liability by:

◦Performing an overlay of the historical claims data used in management's
current year model to the data used in prior periods to validate that there
were no material changes to the claims data tested in prior periods.

◦Developing an independent estimate of the IBNR claim liability and comparing
our estimate to management's estimate.

◦Performing a retrospective review comparing management's prior year estimate
of IBNR to claims processed in 2022 with dates of service in 2021 or prior.

UnitedHealth Group

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

1.Description of Business

UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its
subsidiaries, "UnitedHealth Group" and "the Company") is a health care and
well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help
make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet
complementary business platforms -- Optum and UnitedHealthcare -- are working
to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access,
affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations
we are privileged to serve.

2.Basis of Presentation, Use of Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to
U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the
accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries.

Use of Estimates

These Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the
Company's best estimates and judgments. The Company's most significant
estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and
goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex
assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters inherently
uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any
change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the
estimate is adjusted.

Revenues

Premiums

Premium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based arrangements in which
the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year
period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers'
health care and related administrative costs.

Premium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals
are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments
received from the Company's customers in advance of the service period are
recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S.
health plans, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit
(Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios (MLRs) as calculated under
the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and
related federal and state regulations and implementing regulation, falling
below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their
premiums annually. Commercial premiums within the Company's individual and
small group markets are also subject to the ACA risk adjustment program.
Medicare Advantage premium revenue includes the impact of the Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) quality bonuses based on plans' Star
rating. Certain of the Company's Medicaid business is also subject to state
minimum MLR rebates.

Premium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned, net of
projected rebates, because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the
ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium
revenues for certain value-based arrangements at its Optum Health care
delivery businesses. Under these value-based arrangements, the Company enters
into agreements with health plans to stand ready to deliver, integrate, direct
and control certain health care services for patients. In exchange, the
Company receives a premium that is typically paid on a per-patient per-month
basis. The Company considers these value-based arrangements to represent a
single performance obligation where premium revenues are recognized in the
period in which health care services are made available.

The Company's Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are
subject to periodic adjustment under CMS' risk adjustment payment methodology.
CMS deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all
health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The
CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees
diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are
healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk
adjusted premium payment using diagnosis and encounter data from hospital
inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company
and health care providers collect, capture and submit the necessary and
available data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk
adjustment premium revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be
submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for the Company's plans are subject to
review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 for
additional information regarding these audits.

Products and Services

For the Company's Optum Rx pharmacy care services business, the majority of
revenues are derived from products sold through a contracted network of retail
pharmacies or home delivery, specialty and community health pharmacies.
Product revenues include the cost of pharmaceuticals (net of rebates), a
negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments. Pharmacy products are
billed to customers based on the number of transactions occurring during the
billing period. Product revenues are recognized when the prescriptions are
dispensed. The Company has entered into contracts in which it is primarily
obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their
customers regardless of whether the Company is paid. The Company is also
involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining
which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail
pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors' members
and accordingly, product revenues are reported on a gross basis.

Services revenue includes a number of services and products sold through
Optum. Optum Health's service revenues include net patient service revenues
recorded based upon established billing rates, less allowances for contractual
adjustments, and are recognized as services are provided. For its financial
services offerings, Optum Health charges fees and earns investment income on
managed funds. Optum Insight provides software and information products,
advisory consulting arrangements and managed services outsourcing contracts,
which may be delivered over several years. Optum Insight revenues are
generally recognized over time and measured each period based on the progress
to date as services are performed or made available to customers.

Services revenue also consists of fees derived from services performed for
customers who self-insure the health care costs of their employees and
employees' dependents. Under service fee contracts, the Company receives
monthly, a fixed fee per employee, which is recognized as revenue as the
Company performs, or makes available, the applicable services to the customer.
The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their
employees and employees' dependents, and the Company administers the payment
of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from
customer-funded bank accounts. As the Company has neither the obligation for
funding the health care costs, nor the primary responsibility for providing
the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical
costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For these
fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and
facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer
and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of
physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. These services are
performed throughout the contract period.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, accounts receivables related to products and
services were $7.1 billion and $5.4 billion, respectively. In 2022 and 2021,
the Company had no material bad-debt expense and there were no material
contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 or 2021.

For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, revenue recognized from
performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to changes
in transaction price) was not material.

Revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining
performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts having an
original expected duration of one year or less, contracts where revenue is
recognized as invoiced and contracts with variable consideration related to
undelivered performance obligations, was $12.5 billion, of which approximately
half is expected to be recognized in the next three years.

See Note 14 for disaggregation of revenue by segment and type.

Medical Costs and Medical Costs Payable

The Company's estimate of medical costs payable represents management's best
estimate of its liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2022.

Each period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs
payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts
and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, the
Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in
estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified.
Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and
settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within
twelve months.

Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Company's
obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of consumers, but for
which claims have either not yet been received, processed, or paid. The
Company develops estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported
(IBNR), which includes estimates for claims which have not been received or
fully processed, using an actuarial process consistently applied, centrally
controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time
from date of service to claim processing, seasonal variances in medical care
consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, care activity and
other medical cost trends, membership volume and

demographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes, and
business mix changes related to products, customers and geography.

In developing its medical costs payable estimates, the Company applies
different estimation methods depending on which incurred claims are being
estimated. For the most recent two months, the Company estimates claim costs
incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per
member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more
complete claim data are available, supplemented by a review of near-term
completion factors (actuarial estimates, based upon historical experience and
analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a
given period adjudicated by the Company at the date of estimation). For months
prior to the most recent two months, the Company applies the completion
factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount
of ultimate incurred claims for those months.

Cost of Products Sold

The Company's cost of products sold includes the cost of pharmaceuticals
dispensed to unaffiliated customers either directly at its home delivery,
specialty and community pharmacy locations, or indirectly through its
nationwide network of participating pharmacies. Rebates attributable to
unaffiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost
of products sold, with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates
to be remitted to those unaffiliated clients in accordance with their
contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a
reduction of product revenue. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of
personnel to support the Company's transaction processing services, system
sales, maintenance and professional services.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments

Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments having an original
maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents
approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the
instruments.

Investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-
term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in
long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company
classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized
cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale
and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available.
Equity investments, with certain exceptions, are measured at fair value with
changes in fair value recognized in net earnings.

The Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-
for-sale debt securities from net earnings and reports them as comprehensive
income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of equity. To
calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities, the
Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold.

The Company evaluates an available-for-sale debt security for credit-related
impairment by considering the present value of expected cash flows relative to
a security's amortized cost, the extent to which fair value is less than
amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer
and specific events or circumstances which may influence the operations of the
issuer. Credit-related impairments are recorded as an allowance, with an
offset to investment and other income. Non-credit related impairments are
recorded through other comprehensive income. If the Company intends to sell an
impaired security, or will likely be required to sell a security before
recovery of the entire amortized cost, the entire impairment is included in
net earnings.

New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The
Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one
issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to investment
grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will
be disposed of in accordance with the Company's investment policy.

Assets Under Management

The Company provides health insurance products and services to members of AARP
under a Supplemental Health Insurance Program (the AARP Program) and to AARP
members and non-members under separate Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D
arrangements. The products and services under the AARP Program include
supplemental Medicare benefits, hospital indemnity insurance, including
insurance for individuals between 50 to 64 years of age, and other related
products.

Pursuant to the Company's agreement with AARP, program assets are managed
separately from the Company's general investment portfolio and are used to pay
costs associated with the AARP Program. These assets are invested at the
Company's discretion, within investment guidelines approved by AARP. The
Company does not guarantee any rates of return on these investments and, upon
any transfer of the AARP Program contract to another entity, the Company would
transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at the
date of transfer to the entity. Because the purpose of these assets is to fund
the medical costs payable, the rate stabilization fund (RSF) liabilities and
other related liabilities associated with this AARP contract, assets under
management are classified as current assets, consistent with the
classification of these liabilities.

44

Table of Contents

The effects of changes in other balance sheet amounts associated with the AARP
Program also accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through
the RSF balance. Accordingly, the Company excludes the effect of such changes
in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Other Current Receivables

Other current receivables include amounts due from pharmaceutical
manufacturers for rebates and Medicare Part D drug discounts, accrued interest
and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company.

The Company's pharmacy care services businesses contract with pharmaceutical
manufacturers, some of which provide rebates based on use of the
manufacturers' products by its affiliated and unaffiliated clients. The
Company accrues rebates as they are earned by its clients on a monthly basis
based on the terms of the applicable contracts, historical data and current
estimates. The pharmacy care services businesses bill these rebates to the
manufacturers on a monthly or quarterly basis depending on the contractual
terms and record rebates attributable to affiliated clients as a reduction to
medical costs. The Company generally receives rebates two to five months after
billing. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, total pharmaceutical manufacturer
rebates receivable included in other receivables in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets amounted to $8.2 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company's Medicare Part D receivables
amounted to $1.3 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively.

Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets

Prepaid expenses and other current assets include pharmaceutical drug and
supplies inventory of $3.5 billion and $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively.

Property, Equipment and Capitalized Software

Property, equipment and capitalized software are stated at cost, net of
accumulated depreciation and amortization. Capitalized software consists of
certain costs incurred in the development of internal-use software, including
external direct costs of materials and services and applicable payroll costs
of employees devoted to specific software development.

The Company calculates depreciation and amortization using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives for
property, equipment and capitalized software are: | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Furniture, fixtures and equipment|

3 to 10 years  
  
Buildings|

35 to 40 years  
  
Capitalized software|

3 to 5 years  
  
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the remaining lease
term or their estimated useful economic life.

Operating Leases

The Company leases facilities and equipment under long-term operating leases
which are non-cancelable and expire on various dates. At the lease
commencement date, lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are
recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments
over the lease term, which includes all fixed obligations arising from the
lease contract. If an interest rate is not implicit in a lease, the Company
utilizes its incremental borrowing rate for a period closely matching the
lease term.

The Company's ROU assets are included in other assets, and lease liabilities
are included in other current liabilities and other liabilities in the
Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Goodwill

To determine whether goodwill is impaired, annually or more frequently if
needed, the Company performs impairment tests. The Company may first assess
qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying
value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company may
also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the
quantitative testing. When performing quantitative testing, the Company first
estimates the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flows.
To determine fair values, the Company must make assumptions about a wide
variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the
impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including
significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income
taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value and discount
rates. Comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the
discounted cash flow test. If the fair value is less than the carrying value
of the reporting unit, an impairment is recognized for the difference, up to
the carrying amount of goodwill.

There was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2022,
2021 and 2020.

Table of Contents

Intangible Assets

The Company's intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or
circumstances indicate an intangible asset (or asset group) may be impaired.
The Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for
impairment annually. There was no impairment of intangible assets during the
years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

Other Current Liabilities

Other current liabilities include health savings account deposits ($13.5
billion and $11.4 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively),
accruals for premium rebates payable, the RSF associated with the AARP
Program, the current portion of future policy benefits and customer balances.

Policy Acquisition Costs

The Company's short duration health insurance contracts typically have a one-
year term and may be canceled by the customer with at least 30 days' notice.
Costs related to the acquisition and renewal of short duration customer
contracts are primarily charged to expense as incurred.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Company's subsidiaries whose
redemption is outside of the Company's control are classified as temporary
equity. These interests primarily relate to put options on unowned shares,
which are typically redeemable at fair value after a certain time period. The
Company accretes changes in the redemption value to the earliest redemption
date utilizing the interest method. If all interests were currently
redeemable, the difference between the carrying value and the estimated
redemption value is not material. The following table provides details of the
Company's redeemable noncontrolling interests' activity for the years ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021:| | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

Share-Based Compensation

The Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards, including
stock options and restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively,
restricted shares), on a straight-line basis over the related service period
(generally the vesting period) of the award, or to an employee's eligible
retirement date under the award agreement, if earlier. Restricted shares vest
ratably, primarily over four years, and compensation expense related to
restricted shares is based on the share price on the date of grant. Stock
options vest ratably primarily over four years and may be exercised up to 10
years from the date of grant. Compensation expense related to stock options is
based on the fair value at the date of grant, which is estimated on the date
of grant using a binomial option-pricing model. Under the Company's Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), eligible employees are allowed to purchase the
Company's stock at a discounted price, which is 90% of the market price of the
Company's common stock at the end of the six-month purchase period. Share-
based compensation expense for all programs is recognized in operating costs
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Net Earnings Per Common Share

The Company computes basic earnings per common share attributable to
UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by dividing net earnings attributable
to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. The Company determines diluted
net earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common
shareholders using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
during the period, adjusted for potentially dilutive shares associated with
stock options, restricted shares and the ESPP (collectively, common stock
equivalents), using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method
assumes a hypothetical issuance of shares to settle the share-based awards,
with the assumed proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market
price for the period. Assumed proceeds include the amount the employee must
pay upon exercise and the average unrecognized compensation cost. The
difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares
assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares.

The Company's unrealized losses from all securities as of December 31, 2022
were generated from approximately 35,000 positions out of a total of 41,000
positions. The Company believes it will collect the timely principal and
interest due on its debt securities having an amortized cost in excess of fair
value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases
and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these
securities which impacted the Company's assessment on collectability of
principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates
available-for-sale debt securities for any credit-related impairment when the
fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company
evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit
ratings of the issuers noting no significant credit deterioration since
purchase. As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not have the intent to sell
any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company
believes these losses to be temporary. The allowance for credit losses on
available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was not
material.

4. Fair Value

Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Consolidated
Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified
into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. In instances in which
the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair
value hierarchy, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety
based on the lowest level input which is significant to the fair value
measurement in its entirety. The Company's assessment of the significance of a
particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires
judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or
liability.

Table of Contents

The fair value hierarchy is summarized as follows:

Level 1 -- Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets/liabilities in
active markets.

Level 2 -- Other observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, including:

•Quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets;

•Quoted prices for identical or similar assets/liabilities in inactive markets
(e.g., few transactions, limited information, noncurrent prices, high
variability over time);

•Inputs other than quoted prices observable for the asset/liability (e.g.,
interest rates, yield curves, implied volatilities, credit spreads); and

•Inputs corroborated by other observable market data.

Level 3 -- Unobservable inputs cannot be corroborated by observable market
data.

There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 financial assets or liabilities
during the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2021.

Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value
adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an
impairment. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company
recognized $211 million and $840 million, respectively, of unrealized gains in
investment and other income related to fair value adjustments on equity
securities primarily in our venture portfolio, based upon transaction of the
same or similar security. There were no other significant fair value
adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during the years ended
December 31, 2022 or 2021.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value and
determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial
instrument included in the tables below:

Cash and Cash Equivalents. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents
approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. Fair values
of cash equivalent instruments which do not trade on a regular basis in active
markets are classified as Level 2.

Debt and Equity Securities. Fair values of debt securities and equity
securities reported at fair value on a recurring basis are based on quoted
market prices, where available. The Company obtains one price for each
security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which
generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair
value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through
recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, and, if
necessary, makes adjustments through the reporting date based upon available
observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing
service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted
cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs currently observable in the markets
for similar securities. Inputs often used in the valuation methodologies
include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default
rates, prepayment speeds and nonbinding broker quotes. As the Company is
responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly
analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether
the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, the Company
compares the prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a
secondary pricing source, such as its custodian, its investment consultant and
third-party investment advisors. Additionally, the Company compares changes in
the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the
reasonableness of the reported prices. The Company's internal price
verification procedures and reviews of fair value methodology documentation
provided by independent pricing services have not historically resulted in
adjustment to the prices obtained from the pricing service.

Fair values of debt securities which do not trade on a regular basis in active
markets but are priced using other observable inputs are classified as Level
2\.

Fair value estimates for Level 1 and Level 2 equity securities reported at
fair value on a recurring basis are based on quoted market prices for actively
traded equity securities and/or other market data for the same or comparable
instruments and transactions in establishing the prices.

The fair values of Level 3 investments in corporate bonds, which are not a
significant portion of our investments, are estimated using valuation
techniques relying heavily on management assumptions and qualitative
observations.

Throughout the procedures discussed above in relation to the Company's
processes for validating third-party pricing information, the Company
validates the understanding of assumptions and inputs used in security pricing
and determines the proper classification in the hierarchy based on such
understanding.

Assets Under Management. Assets under management consists of debt securities
and other investments held to fund costs associated with the AARP Program and
are priced and classified using the same methodologies as the Company's
investments in debt and equity securities.

Long-Term Debt. The fair values of the Company's long-term debt are estimated
and classified using the same methodologies as the Company's investments in
debt securities.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, prior year's medical cost reserve
development included no individual factors that were significant. For the
years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, prior years' medical cost reserve
development was primarily driven by lower than expected care activity.
Additionally, prior years' medical cost reserve development in the year ended
December 31, 2021 was driven by care patterns disrupted by COVID-19.

Medical costs payable included IBNR of $20.0 billion and $17.1 billion at
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Substantially all of the IBNR
balance as of December 31, 2022 relates to the current year.

billion 364-day revolving bank credit facilities with 25 banks, which mature
in December 2027, December 2025 and December 2023, respectively. These
facilities provide full liquidity support for the Company's commercial paper
program and are available for general corporate purposes. As of December 31,
2022, no amounts had been drawn on any of the bank credit facilities. The
annual interest rates, which are variable based on term, are calculated based

Adjustment of 10 basis points plus a credit spread based on the Company's
senior unsecured credit ratings. If amounts had been drawn on the bank credit
facilities as of December 31, 2022, annual interest rates would have ranged
from 5.1% to 7.5%.

Debt Covenants

The Company's bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including
requiring the Company to maintain a debt to debt-plus-shareholders' equity
ratio of not more than 60%. The Company was in compliance with its debt
covenants as of December 31, 2022.

9. Income Taxes 

The current income tax provision reflects the tax consequences of revenues and
expenses currently taxable or deductible on various income tax returns for the
year reported. The deferred income tax provision or benefit generally reflects
the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year,
excluding any deferred income tax assets and liabilities of acquired
businesses. The components of the provision for income taxes for the years
ended December 31 are as follows:| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

Valuation allowances are provided when it is considered more likely than not
deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowances primarily
relate to future tax benefits on certain federal, state and non-U.S. net
operating loss carryforwards. Gross federal net operating loss carryforwards
of $490 million expire beginning in 2023 through 2037 and $611 million have an
indefinite carryforward period; state net operating loss carryforwards expire
beginning in 2023 through 2042, with some having an indefinite carryforward
period. Substantially all of the non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards have
indefinite carryforward periods.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company's undistributed earnings from non-U.S.
subsidiaries are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S.
operations, and therefore no U.S. deferred taxes have been recorded. Taxes
payable on the remittance of such earnings would be minimal.

The Company believes it is reasonably possible its liability for unrecognized
tax benefits will decrease in the next twelve months by $260 million as a
result of audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations.

The Company classifies net interest and penalties associated with uncertain
income tax positions as income taxes within its Consolidated Statements of
Operations. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the
Company recognized $64 million, $66 million and $52 million of net interest
and penalties, respectively. The Company had $253 million and $194 million of
accrued interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions as of December 31,
2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts are not included in the
reconciliation above. As of December 31, 2022, there were $1.7 billion of
unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax
rate.

The Company currently files income tax returns in the United States, various
states and localities and non-U.S. jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) has completed exams on the consolidated income tax returns for
fiscal years 2016 and prior. The Company's 2017 through 2020 tax years are
under review by the IRS under its Compliance Assurance Program. With the
exception of a few states, the Company is no longer subject to income tax
examinations prior to the 2014 tax year. In general, the Company is subject to
examination in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years 2015 and forward.

10. Shareholders' Equity

Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions

The Company's regulated insurance and HMO subsidiaries are subject to
regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards,
among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of
statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing
and amount of dividends and other distributions which may be paid to their
parent companies. In the United States, most of these state regulations and
standards are generally consistent with model regulations established by the
NAIC. These standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory
unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the
regulated subsidiary's level of statutory net income and statutory capital and
surplus. These dividends are referred to as "ordinary dividends" and generally
may be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with
other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified
statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is
generally considered an "extraordinary dividend" and must receive prior
regulatory approval.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company's domestic insurance and HMO
subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $8.8 billion, including
$7.4 billion of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2021,
the Company's domestic insurance and HMO subsidiaries paid their parent
companies dividends of $8.0 billion, including $4.7 billion of extraordinary
dividends.

The Company's global financially regulated subsidiaries had estimated
aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $33.8 billion as of December 31,
2022. The estimated statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy
regulatory requirements of the Company's global financially regulated
subsidiaries was approximately $15.4 billion as of December 31, 2022.

Optum Bank must meet minimum capital requirements of the FDIC under the
capital adequacy rules to which it is subject. At December 31, 2022, the
Company believes Optum Bank met the FDIC requirements to be considered "Well
Capitalized."

Share Repurchase Program

Under its Board of Directors' authorization, the Company maintains a share
repurchase program. The objectives of the share repurchase program are to
optimize the Company's capital structure and cost of capital, thereby
improving returns to shareholders, as well as to offset the dilutive impact of
share-based awards. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market
purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured
share repurchase programs), subject to certain restrictions. In June 2018, the
Board of Directors renewed the Company's share repurchase program with an
authorization to repurchase up to 100 million shares of its common stock.

A summary of common share repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2022
and 2021 is as follows:| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

Share-Based Compensation Recognition and Estimates

The principal assumptions the Company used in calculating grant-date fair
value for stock options were as follows:| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
|  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | For the Years Ended December 31,  
| | 2022| | 2021| | 2020  
Risk-free interest rate| | 1.9% - 4.3%| | 0.7% - 1.2%| | 0.2% - 1.4%  
Expected volatility| | 30.6% -30.8%| | 29.2% - 29.8%| | 22.2% - 29.5%  
Expected dividend yield| | 1.2%| | 1.3% - 1.5%| | 1.4% - 1.7%  
Forfeiture rate| | 5.0%| | 5.0%| | 5.0%  
Expected life in years| | 4.7| | 4.8| | 5.1  
  
Risk-free interest rates are based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the
time of grant. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of
the Company's common stock and the implied volatility from exchange-traded
options on the Company's common stock. Expected dividend yields are based on
the per share cash dividend paid by the Company. The Company uses historical
data to estimate option exercises and forfeitures within the valuation model.
The expected lives of options granted represents the period of time the awards
granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical exercise patterns.

Other Employee Benefit Plans

The Company offers a 401(k) plan for its employees. Compensation expense
related to this plan was not material for 2022, 2021 and 2020.

In addition, the Company maintains non-qualified, deferred compensation plans,
which allow certain members of senior management and executives to defer
portions of their salary or bonus. The deferrals are recorded within long-term
investments with an approximately equal amount in other liabilities in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total deferrals are distributable based upon
termination of employment or other periods, as elected under each plan and
were $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively.

Other Commitments

The Company provides guarantees related to its service level under certain
contracts. If minimum standards are not met, the Company may be financially at
risk up to a stated percentage of the contracted fee or a stated dollar
amount. None of the amounts accrued, paid or charged to income for service
level guarantees were material as of December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020.

Pending Acquisitions

As of December 31, 2022, the Company has entered into agreements to acquire
companies in the health care sector, most notably, LHC Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:
LHCG), subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.
The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, excluding the
payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $9 billion. The Company
completed the acquisition of LHC Group, Inc. on February 22, 2023.

Legal Matters

The Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and
regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members,
care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators,
relating to the Company's businesses, including management and administration
of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical
malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and
contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other
business practices.

The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting
from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal
and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to
predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for
monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present
novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a
large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the
proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly,
the Company is often unable to

estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a
reasonable possibility or it is probable a loss may be incurred.

Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews

The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental
investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special
investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and
welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector
General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the
Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S.
Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the SEC, the
IRS, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor,
the FDIC, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Defense Contract Audit
Agency and other governmental authorities. Similarly, our international
businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by
applicable foreign governments, including South American and other non-U.S.
governmental authorities. Certain of the Company's businesses have been
reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters,
compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-
adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company's local plans for
risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices
of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such
audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the
Company's health plans.

On February 14, 2017, the DOJ announced its decision to pursue certain claims
within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal
by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower's complaint, which was unsealed
on February 15, 2017, alleges the Company made improper risk adjustment
submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 2018, the court
granted in part and denied in part the Company's motion to dismiss. In May
2018, the DOJ moved to dismiss the Company's counterclaims, which were filed
in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. In March 2019, the
court denied the government's motion for partial summary judgment and
dismissed the Company's counterclaims without prejudice. The Company cannot
reasonably estimate the outcome which may result from this matter given its
procedural status.

13. Business Combinations

On October 3, 2022, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common shares
of Change Healthcare Inc. (Change) and funded Change's payoff of its
outstanding debt and credit facility for a total of $13.9 billion in cash. The
combination of the Company and Change will connect and simplify the core
clinical, administrative and payment processes health care providers and
payers depend on to serve patients. Change brings key technologies,
connections and advanced clinical decision, administrative and financial
support capabilities, enabling better workflow and transactional connectivity
across the health care system.

Subsequent to closing and as planned, the Company sold Change's claims editing
business to an affiliate of investment funds of TPG Inc. for $2.2 billion in
cash. The net assets and net liabilities associated with this sale were
classified as held-for-sale at the time of acquisition. There was no gain or
loss associated with this transaction.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company completed several other
business combinations for total consideration of $8.8 billion. The Company
also sold other businesses for $1.2 billion of cash, with a carrying value of
$600 million, and the difference reflected in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations.

14. Segment Financial Information

Factors used to determine the Company's reportable segments include the nature
of operating activities, economic characteristics, existence of separate
senior management teams and the type of information used by the Company's
chief operating decision maker to evaluate its results of operations.
Reportable segments with similar economic characteristics, products and
services, customers, distribution methods and operational processes which
operate in a similar regulatory environment are combined.

The following is a description of the types of products and services from
which each of the Company's four reportable segments derives its revenues:

•UnitedHealthcare includes the combined results of operations of
UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement
and UnitedHealthcare Community & State. The U.S. businesses share significant
common assets, including a contracted network of physicians, health care
professionals, hospitals and other facilities, information technology and
consumer engagement infrastructure and other resources. Domestically,
UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual offers an array of consumer-oriented
health benefit plans and services for employers and individuals. Globally,
UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual provides health and dental benefits and
hospital and clinical services to employers and individuals in South America
and other diversified global businesses. UnitedHealthcare Medicare &
Retirement provides health care coverage and health and well-being services to
individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs. UnitedHealthcare
Community & State provides diversified health care benefits products and
services to state programs caring for the economically disadvantaged, the
medically underserved and those without the benefit of employer-funded health
care coverage.

•Optum Health focuses on care delivery, care management, wellness and consumer
engagement, and health financial services. Optum Health is building a
comprehensive, connected health care delivery and engagement platform by
directly providing high-quality care, helping people manage chronic and
complex health needs, and proactively engaging consumers in managing their
health through in-person, in-home, virtual and digital clinical platforms.

•Optum Insight brings together advanced analytics, technology and health care
expertise to deliver integrated services and solutions. Hospital systems,
physicians, health plans, governments, life sciences companies and other
organizations depend on Optum Insight to help them improve performance,
achieve efficiency, reduce costs, meet compliance mandates and modernize their
core operating systems to meet the changing needs of the health system.

•Optum Rx offers pharmacy care services and programs, including retail network
contracting, home delivery, specialty and community health pharmacy services,
purchasing and clinical capabilities, and develops programs in areas such as
step therapy, formulary management, drug adherence and disease/drug therapy
management. Optum Rx integrates pharmacy and medical care and is positioned to
serve patients with complex clinical needs and consumers looking for a better
digital pharmacy experience with transparent pricing.

The Company's accounting policies for reportable segment operations are
consistent with those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies (see Note 2). Transactions between reportable segments principally
consist of sales of pharmacy care products and services to UnitedHealthcare
customers by Optum Rx; care delivery, care management services and certain
product offerings sold to UnitedHealthcare by Optum Health; and health
information and technology solutions, consulting and other services sold to
UnitedHealthcare by Optum Insight. These transactions are recorded at
management's estimate of fair value. Transactions with affiliated customers
are eliminated in consolidation. Assets and liabilities jointly used are
assigned to each reportable segment using estimates of pro-rata usage. Cash
and investments are assigned so each reportable segment has working capital
and/or at least minimum specified levels of regulatory capital.

As a percentage of the Company's total consolidated revenues, premium revenues
from CMS were 38%, 36% and 36% for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, most of
which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and included in
the UnitedHealthcare segment. U.S. customer revenue represented approximately
97% of consolidated total revenues for 2022, 2021 and 2020. Long-lived fixed
assets located in the United States represented approximately 81% and 78% of
the total long-lived fixed assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. The non-U.S. revenues and fixed assets are primarily related to
UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual's international businesses.

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)

disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i)
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

In connection with the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management

Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of
December 31, 2022

Management of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the Company)
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company's internal control system is
designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of
directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. The Company's internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a
material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, we
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
(2013). Based on our assessment and the COSO criteria, we believe that, as of
December 31, 2022, the Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting.

The Company's independent registered public accounting firm has audited the
Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022,
as stated in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm,
appearing under Item 9A.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of UnitedHealth Group
Incorporated and Subsidiaries:

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of UnitedHealth
Group Incorporated and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022,
based on criteria established in Internal Control -- Integrated Framework
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control -- Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and
our report dated February 24, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of
December 31, 2022. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are
a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting
was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
