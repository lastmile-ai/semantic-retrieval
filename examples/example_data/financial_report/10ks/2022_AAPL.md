This Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Form 10-K") contains forward-looking
statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Many of the forward-looking
statements are located in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading
"Business" and Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the heading
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations." Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future
events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not
directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in
this Form 10-K regarding the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
on the Company's business and results of operations are forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as
"future," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "expects," "intends,"
"plans," "predicts," "will," "would," "could," "can," "may," and similar
terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and
the Company's actual results may differ significantly from the results
discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such
differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item
1A of this Form 10-K under the heading "Risk Factors." The Company assumes no
obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason,
except as required by law.

Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the
Company's fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters,
months or periods refer to the Company's fiscal years ended in September and

original content and live sports.

Payment Services

The Company offers payment services, including Apple Card®, a co-branded
credit card, and Apple Pay®, a cashless payment service.

Markets and Distribution

The Company's customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized
business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its
products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets
directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education,
enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and
its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect
distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers,
wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2022, the Company's net sales
through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 38% and
62%, respectively, of total net sales.

Competition

The markets for the Company's products and services are highly competitive,
and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward
pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services,
short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement
in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of
technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part
of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company's competitors seek to compete
primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by
imitating the Company's products and infringing on its intellectual property.

The Company's ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the
continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and
technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the
entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,
numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive
factors important to the Company include price, product and service features
(including security features), relative price and performance, product and
service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party
software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability,
service and support, and corporate reputation.

Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 2

* * *

  

The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to
smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and
services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from
companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other
resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings
with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company's competitors have
broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of
active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have
aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have
the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or
no profit or even at a loss. The Company's services compete with business
models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to
obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces
significant competition as competitors imitate the Company's product features
and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated
solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.

Supply of Components

Although most components essential to the Company's business are generally
available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained
from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various
components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal
computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used
by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are
at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing
fluctuations.

The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its
competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom
components available from only one source. When a component or product uses
new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers'
yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The
continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all,
may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common
components instead of components customized to meet the Company's
requirements.

The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components;
however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or
renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.

Substantially all of the Company's hardware products are manufactured by
outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac
computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.

Research and Development

Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by
rapid technological advances, the Company's ability to compete successfully
depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of
competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The
Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and
services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and
development ("R&D"), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of
third-party businesses and technology.

Intellectual Property

The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights
relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and
services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other
forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign
countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual
property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and
that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies
primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing
abilities of its personnel.

The Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark
applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development,
design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications
around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of
issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single
intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company's
products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual
property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and
services.

In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company's
products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by
third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses
relating to various aspects of the Company's products, processes and services.
While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on
commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such
licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.

Business Seasonality and Product Introductions

The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter
compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday
demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly
impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product
introductions can also impact the Company's net sales to its indirect
distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory
following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often
declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be
affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.

Human Capital

The Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and
works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its
team members. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had approximately 164,000
full-time equivalent employees.

Workplace Practices and Policies

The Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and
diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination.

Compensation and Benefits

The Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable,
and should enable employees to share in the Company's success. The Company
recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources
to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional
and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of
benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources
that are designed to support employees' individual growth and development.

Inclusion and Diversity

The Company remains committed to its vision to build and sustain a more
inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The
Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level,
foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to
opportunity for all employees.

Engagement

The Company believes that open and honest communication among team members,
managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment
where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged
to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the
Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career
development, manager performance and inclusivity.

Health and Safety

The Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it
operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop
measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with
general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting
specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard
environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and
security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global
security team. The Company has also taken additional health and safety
measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Available Information

The Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q,

Item 1A. Risk Factors

The Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition
and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently
known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of
these risks materialize from time to time, the Company's business, reputation,
results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially
and adversely affected.

Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the
Company's results of operations and financial condition, past financial
performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future
performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate
results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains
forward-looking statements.

This section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and
the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item
8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.

Macroeconomic and Industry Risks

The Company's operations and performance depend significantly on global and
regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially
adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial
condition.

The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S.
representing a majority of the Company's total net sales. In addition, the
Company's global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the
Company's supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are
located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company's operations and performance
depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.

Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or
recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, changes to
fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high
unemployment and currency fluctuations can adversely impact consumer
confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the
Company's products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending
can be materially adversely affected in response to financial market
volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and
mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, energy shortages and
cost increases, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors.

In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company's products,
uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can
have a significant impact on the Company's suppliers, contract manufacturers,
logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel
partners. Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain
credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company's products; and
insolvency.

A downturn in the economic environment can also lead to increased credit and
collectibility risk on the Company's trade receivables; the failure of
derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the
Company's ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the
fair value of the Company's financial instruments. These and other economic
factors can materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of
operations, financial condition and stock price.

The Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock
price have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially
adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

COVID-19 has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the
world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in
response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business
operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-
place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed
global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in
global financial markets.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response
have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact
the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock
price. During the course of the pandemic, certain of the Company's component
suppliers and manufacturing and logistical service providers have experienced
disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide, and
similar disruptions could occur in the future. Public safety measures can also
adversely impact consumer demand for the Company's products and services in
affected areas.

Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 5

* * *

  

The Company continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in
accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities.
The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company's operational
and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors
outside the Company's control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and
duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development,
availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the
imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the
pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services.
Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse effects
on demand for the Company's products and services, the Company's supply chain
and sales and distribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its
strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.

To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business,
results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have
the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I,
Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other
international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health
issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.

Political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism,
natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other
business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the
global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and
its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers,
distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.

The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S.
representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company
believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade.
Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is performed in whole or in
part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China
mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and
disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions
and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially
adversely affect the Company's business, particularly if these measures occur
in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues
and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between
the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S.
on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions.
Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw
materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact
the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make
the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the
Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may
also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods,
technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and
supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and
services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various
actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships,
and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the
Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can
be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such
restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company
may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such
measures. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by
governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and
could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political
uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have
a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely
affect the Company's business.

Many of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business
operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in
locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In
addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of
interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other
industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and
other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including
pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's
control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural
disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events
can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver
products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's
supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the
Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the
Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant
expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the
Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of
many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would
exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.

The Company's operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents
at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company's suppliers are
required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial
accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life,
disruption to the Company's business, and harm to the Company's reputation.
Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic,
have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect,
the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer
products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as
stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and
the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company's
supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions
of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new
products.

While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses,
such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may
arise.

Global markets for the Company's products and services are highly competitive
and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to
compete effectively in these markets.

The Company's products and services are offered in highly competitive global
markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward
pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services,
short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement
in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of
technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part
of consumers and businesses.

The Company's ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the
continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and
technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the
entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,
numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company
must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these
investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to
develop and market new products and services successfully.

The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and
copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents,
trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company's competitors seek
to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures,
and by imitating the Company's products and infringing on its intellectual
property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently
available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is
unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive
margins or if competitors infringe on the Company's intellectual property, the
Company's ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially
adversely affected.

The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal
computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in
these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing,
distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software
and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company's
competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger
installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as
competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain
competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide
products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in
which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no
growth or contracted overall.

Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate
the Company's product features and applications within their products or
collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they
currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as
competitors imitate the Company's approach to providing components seamlessly
within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.

The Company's services also face substantial competition, including from
companies that have significant resources and experience and have established
service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with
business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also
competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and
applications.

The Company's business, results of operations and financial condition depend
substantially on the Company's ability to continually improve its products and
services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no
assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and
services that compete effectively.

Business Risks

To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must
successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and
services.

Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and
industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually
introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products
and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded
products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and
upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service
introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful
development, market acceptance, the Company's ability to manage the risks
associated with production ramp-up issues, the availability of application
software for the Company's products, the effective management of purchase
commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the
availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to
meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have
quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the
Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of
products and services.

The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical
services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside
of the U.S.

Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is performed in whole or in
part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China
mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant
concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number
of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to
the Company's supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve
significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of
its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can
lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company's direct control over
production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and
may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of
products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company's
flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with
these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense
reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for
warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and
experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While
the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct,
violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can
materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of
operations and financial condition.

The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and
Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners
primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the
Company's hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have
a negative impact on the Company's cost or supply of components or finished
goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit
to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including
natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures,
commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental,
public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.

The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is
held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to
certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While
these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if
these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems
or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced
or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or
prepayments can be negatively impacted.

Future operating results depend upon the Company's ability to obtain
components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.

Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or
limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing
risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple
sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant
commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the
Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. For
example, the global semiconductor industry is experiencing high demand and
shortages of supply, which has adversely affected, and could materially
adversely affect, the Company's ability to obtain sufficient quantities of
components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. While the
Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there
can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these
agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from
poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier
or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company's
ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially
reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic
conditions on the Company's suppliers, described in "The Company's operations
and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic
conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the
Company's business, results of operations and financial condition," above, can
also affect the Company's ability to obtain components. Therefore, the Company
remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases
that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and
financial condition.

The Company's new products often utilize custom components available from only
one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial
capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers' yields have matured or
their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of
these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any
number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the
production of common components instead of components customized to meet the
Company's requirements. When the Company's supply of components for a new or
existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing
partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the
Company's business, results of operations and financial condition have been
adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely
affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.
The Company's business and financial performance could also be materially
adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient
quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities
from an alternative source.

The Company's products and services may be affected from time to time by
design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the
Company's business and result in harm to the Company's reputation.

The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that
can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating
system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often
have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of
hardware or software products. Defects can also exist in components and
products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could
make the Company's products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or
property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company's
products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In
addition, the Company's service offerings can have quality issues and from
time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the
Company's services from time to time have not performed as anticipated and may
not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be
able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and
services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and
performance issues affecting the Company's products and services. In addition,
the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product
replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and
equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other
expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems
can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company's products
and services, and result in harm to the Company's reputation, loss of
competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and
services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.

The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its
inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation
risk.

The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that
have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds
net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee
reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews
long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers' facilities
and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances
indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an
impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which
the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company
believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets
and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance
the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges
given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the
industries in which the Company competes.

The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance
of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations
cover the Company's forecasted component and manufacturing requirements,
typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company's markets are
volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there
is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or
insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm
purchase commitments.

The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may
not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

The Company's products and services are designed to include intellectual
property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third
parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in
which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current
extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the
Company's products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or
intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has
been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual
property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice,
the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can
generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be
no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable
terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual
property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable
terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or
otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of
operations and financial condition.

Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 9

The Company's future performance depends in part on support from third-party
software developers.

The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products
depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and
services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to
develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company's
products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be
developed and maintained for the Company's products, customers may choose not
to buy the Company's products.

The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and
services for its products depends in part on the developers' perception and
analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading
such software and services for the Company's products compared to competitors'
platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal
computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming
platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position
of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be
generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of
developing such applications and services.

The Company's minority market share in the global smartphone, personal
computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or
upgrade software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their
resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors' products with
larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing
platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company's
devices can suffer.

The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling
and innovative software applications for its products. The Company's products
and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when
third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace
of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to
deliver improved customer experiences and can operate incorrectly and can
result in dissatisfied customers.

The Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the
App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the
revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company only retains a commission
from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods within an
application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store,
including actions taken in response to competition, market and legal
conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New
legislative initiatives, such as the European Union ("EU") Digital Markets
Act, could require further changes. The Company is also subject to litigation
and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes
to the Company's business practices, and may in the future result in further
changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company
charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of
apps outside of the App Store. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the
commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate
of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it
is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company's business, results
of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company's
customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms,
could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of
operations and financial condition.

The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital
content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions
to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content
into the Company's own services. The licensing or other distribution
arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do
not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on
commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers
and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and
services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the
Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content
owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company's access to,
or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue
to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with
acceptable usage rules.

The Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to
produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and
subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company's customers. The COVID-19
pandemic has also caused additional restrictions on production and increased
costs for digital content.

Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide
digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements
change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide
these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop
or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.

The Company's success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team
members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees,
including key personnel, and the Company's ability to nurture its distinctive
and inclusive culture.

Much of the Company's future success depends on the talents and efforts of its
team members, the continued availability and service of key personnel,
including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled
employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand
and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley,
where most of the Company's key personnel are located. In addition to intense
competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the
Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could
materially adversely affect the Company's culture, reputation and operational
flexibility.

The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a
significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its
culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company's ability to recruit
and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and
could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company's business,
reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and
other resellers.

The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through
cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which
distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its
products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major
markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education,
enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and
its direct sales force.

Some carriers providing cellular network service for the Company's products
offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users' purchases
of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all
or in the same amounts.

The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance
reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers' stores with Company
employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These
programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or
incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken,
these resellers could stop distributing the Company's products, or uncertainty
regarding demand for some or all of the Company's products could cause
resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's products.

The Company's business and reputation are impacted by information technology
system failures and network disruptions.

The Company and its global supply chain are exposed to information technology
system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents,
power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war,
computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other
cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and
other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company's
or its vendors' business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be
sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely
impact the Company's business by, among other things, preventing access to the
Company's online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding
the manufacturing and shipping of the Company's products. These events could
materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of
operations and financial condition.

Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information,
including personal information, could subject the Company to significant
reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.

The Company's business requires it to use and store confidential information,
including personal information, with respect to the Company's customers and
employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data
security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures
intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide
absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of
confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the
Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company's business also requires it to share confidential information with
suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that
are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt
business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential
information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the
Company's behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or
unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur. Such
incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the
Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 11

* * *

  

The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain
unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to
compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential
information or disrupt normal business operations, and could, among other
things, impair the Company's ability to attract and retain customers for its
products and services, impact the Company's stock price, materially damage
commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government
investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against
the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both
frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and
techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and
remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company's
ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition,
attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of
severe diplomatic or armed conflict.

Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential
information, including personal information, affect many companies across
various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being
targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential
information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.

The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its
information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of
sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including
through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all
companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities
and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error,
malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities.
For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company's or its
vendors' employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other
sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to
the Company's or its vendors' systems and services. To help protect customers
and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like
multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual
activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among
other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede
customer access to the Company's products and services.

While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address
certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be
insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.

Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the
Company's ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and
materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of
operations and financial condition.

The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business
strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and
uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations,
greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and
regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or
countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and
intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition
transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain
required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition
of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing
a transaction or otherwise limit the Company's ability to fully realize the
anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky
and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could
materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of
operations and financial condition.

The Company's retail stores have required and will continue to require a
substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous
risks and uncertainties.

The Company's retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment
and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The
Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space.
Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to
promote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations
and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the
Company's more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure
associated with the Company's retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure
or poor performance of an individual store or multiple stores, including as a
result of protective public safety measures in response to the COVID-19
pandemic, could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of
equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs.

The Company's retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks
and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company's business, results
of operations and financial condition, including macro-economic factors that
could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include
the Company's ability to: manage costs associated with retail store
construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail
partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail
inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a
reasonable cost.

Legal and Regulatory Compliance Risks

The Company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be
adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government
investigations.

The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government
investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have
not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In
addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include
indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages
in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of
claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company,
and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government
investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to
increase.

The Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent
claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in
the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies
frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into
litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of
intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement
actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in
various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions
and substantial damages.

Regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or
responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and
disruptive to the Company's operations. In recognition of these
considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to
settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such
agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not
occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company's cost of
sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business
practices and limit the Company's ability to offer certain products and
services.

Except as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading
"Legal Proceedings" and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, "Commitments and Contingencies"
under the heading "Contingencies," in the opinion of management, there was not
at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material
loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss
contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.

The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently
uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or
an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above
management's expectations, the Company's results of operations and financial
condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.
Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or
trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial
corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and can require
the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company's ability
to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially
adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and
financial condition.

While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims,
such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types
of claims that may arise.

The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide,
which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other
adverse effects on the Company's business.

The Company's global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and
regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data
localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce;
financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property
ownership and infringement; digital platforms; internet, telecommunications,
and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content;
availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and
employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange
controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti-money laundering; foreign
ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including
electronic waste, recycling, and climate change.

Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and
changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company's business by
increasing the Company's costs, limiting the Company's ability to offer a
product, service or feature to customers, impacting customer demand for the
Company's products and services, and requiring changes to the Company's supply
chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create
uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and
applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company's products and
services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and
financial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures
designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there
can be no assurance the Company's employees, contractors or agents will not
violate such laws and regulations or the Company's policies and procedures. If
the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could
materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of
operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that
materially adversely affect the Company's business may be announced with
little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively
mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is
subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its
products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place
that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no
assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a
violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company's products could
be delayed or prohibited from importation, either of which could materially
adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and
financial condition.

Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations
expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational
harm, and other adverse effects on the Company's business.

Many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other
stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance
considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse
gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In
addition, the Company makes statements about its environmental, social and
governance goals and initiatives through its environmental, social and
governance report, its other non-financial reports, information provided on
its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these
environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of
these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires
investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is
outside the Company's control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will
achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and
initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company's
goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to
achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements,
comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and
governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder
expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings
against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company's business,
reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.

The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject
to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company
to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and
penalties.

From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including
actions taken in response to competition, market and legal conditions. The
Company may make further business changes in the future. New legislative
initiatives, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, or similar laws in other
jurisdictions, could require further changes. These changes could include how
and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms
and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store.

The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various
jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and
claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have
a materially adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations
and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of
investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms
and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the
Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required
to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially
adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial
condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App
Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company's business practices, and
may in the future result in further changes.

Further, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the
technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and
litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially
adversely affect the Company's commercial relationships with those business
partners and materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of
operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue
from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search
services on the Company's platforms and apps, and certain of these
arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal
proceedings.

Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 14

There can be no assurance the Company's business will not be materially
adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such
investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future.
Changes to the Company's business practices to comply with new laws and
regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively
impact the reputation of the Company's products for privacy and security and
otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company's products
and services, and result in harm to the Company's reputation, loss of
competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and
services, and lost sales.

The Company's business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws,
rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.

The Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to
the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of
personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party
transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the
Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed
laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing
additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to
develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying
with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur
substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company
to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant
penalties or legal liability.

The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal
information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website,
press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure
by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal,
state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could
result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental
entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could
include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.

In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention,
security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to
specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under
applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data.
Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and
breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by
governmental authorities regarding the Company's compliance with these
obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and
requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not
permitted by law or under the Company's agreements with healthcare or
financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government
investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and
can also incur significant fees or fines.

Payment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment
card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially
compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses
and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow
payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also
experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose
the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card
industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the
Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

Financial Risks

The Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to
fluctuate.

The Company's profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic
segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the
Company's products and services vary significantly and can change over time.
The Company's gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure
due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product
pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in
response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company's ability to
effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services;
compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the
cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring
and delivering content for the Company's services; the Company's ability to
manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of
products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix,
including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify
its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates;
inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new
products or services, including new products or services with higher cost
structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on
the Company's results of operations and financial condition.

The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter
compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday
demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly
impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company
generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a
decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net
sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as
lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company's products or services, issues
with new product or service introductions, information technology system
failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company's logistics,
components supply, or manufacturing partners.

Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 15

The Company's financial performance is subject to risks associated with
changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.

The Company's primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates
relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales, cost of sales and operating
expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company's products in foreign
countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign
suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange
rate fluctuations.

The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely
affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated
sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international
pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company's products. In some
circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to
raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar's strengthening, which
would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company
earns on foreign currency-denominated sales.

Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar,
while generally beneficial to the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales
and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and
incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting
the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase
the Company's cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus
adversely affecting gross margins.

The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and
option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be
effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial
effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited
time the hedges are in place.

The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its
investment portfolio.

The Company's investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity,
credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions,
political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors.
As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company's cash, cash equivalents,
and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially.
Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its
cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future
fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have
a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial
condition.

The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor
non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements,
and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.

The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through
third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers.
The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-
sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A
substantial majority of the Company's outstanding trade receivables are not
covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or
credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company's trade receivables
can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The
Company's exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables
is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such
risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade
receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and
other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for
the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with
long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of
September 24, 2022, the Company's vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments
related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few
individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures
to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade
receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such
procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.

The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or
international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.

The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign
jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company's subsidiaries
are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax
rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may
be subject to significant change. The Company's effective tax rates are
affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing
statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and
liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their
interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The application of tax laws
may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing
interpretations.

Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 16

* * *

  

The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other
tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and
governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an
adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of
its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these
examinations. If the Company's effective tax rates were to increase,
particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the
Company's taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued,
the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be
materially adversely affected.

General Risks

The price of the Company's stock is subject to volatility.

The Company's stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past
and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the
technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time,
experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected
stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies'
operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which
the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock's
price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock
should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company
also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash
dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share
repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to
declaration by the Company's Board of Directors, and the Company's share
repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of
shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth,
profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the
price of the Company's stock may decline significantly, which could have a
material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2. Properties

The Company's headquarters are located in Cupertino, California. As of
September 24, 2022, the Company owned or leased facilities and land for
corporate functions, R&D, data centers, retail and other purposes at locations
throughout the U.S. and in various places outside the U.S. The Company
believes its existing facilities and equipment, which are used by all
reportable segments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for the
conduct of its business.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

Epic Games

Epic Games, Inc. ("Epic") filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California (the "Northern California District Court")
against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws
and California's unfair competition law based upon the Company's operation of
its App Store. The Company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On
September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of
the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic's
claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company's claims for
breach of contract. The Northern California District Court found that certain
provisions of the Company's App Store Review Guidelines violate California's
unfair competition law and issued an injunction. Epic appealed the decision.
The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay pending the
appeal.

Other Legal Proceedings

The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not
been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business.
The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2022 that did
not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company's
financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is
inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the
Company in a reporting period for amounts above management's expectations, the
Company's financial condition and operating results for that reporting period
could be materially adversely affected.

Fiscal Year Highlights

Fiscal 2022 Highlights

Total net sales increased 8% or $28.5 billion during 2022 compared to 2021,
driven primarily by higher net sales of iPhone, Services and Mac. The weakness
in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable year-
over-year impact on all Products and Services net sales during 2022.

The Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various
times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal 2022 included
the following:

First Quarter 2022:

•Updated MacBook Pro 14" and MacBook Pro 16", powered by the Apple M1 Pro or
M1 Max chip; and

•Third generation of AirPods.

Second Quarter 2022:

•Updated iPhone SE with 5G technology;

•All-new Mac Studio, powered by the Apple M1 Max or M1 Ultra chip;

•All-new Studio Display™; and

•Updated iPad Air with 5G technology, powered by the Apple M1 chip.

Third Quarter 2022:

•Updated MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13", both powered by the Apple M2 chip;

•iOS 16, macOS Ventura, iPadOS 16 and watchOS 9, updates to the Company's
operating systems; and

•Apple Pay Later, a buy now, pay later service.

Fourth Quarter 2022:

•iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max;

•Second generation of AirPods Pro; and

In April 2022, the Company announced an increase to its Program authorization
from $315 billion to $405 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.22
to $0.23 per share beginning in May 2022. During 2022, the Company repurchased
$90.2 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents
of $14.8 billion.

COVID-19

The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact
around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented
measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary
closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The
COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic
activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial
markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in
response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company's
business, results of operations and financial condition.

Certain of the Company's outsourcing partners, component suppliers and
logistical service providers have experienced disruptions during the COVID-19
pandemic, resulting in supply shortages. Similar disruptions could occur in
the future.

Segment Operating Performance

The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The
Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China,
Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South
America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East
and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest
of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in
the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments
provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one
is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company's
customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each
geographic region. Further information regarding the Company's reportable
segments can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, "Segment Information and
Geographic Data."

The following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2022, 2021 and
2020 (dollars in millions):

Americas

Americas net sales increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to
higher net sales of iPhone, Services and Mac.

Europe

Europe net sales increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to
higher net sales of iPhone and Services. The weakness in foreign currencies
relative to the U.S. dollar had a net unfavorable year-over-year impact on
Europe net sales during 2022.

Greater China

Greater China net sales increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily
to higher net sales of iPhone and Services. The strength of the renminbi
relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable year-over-year impact on Greater
China net sales during 2022.

Japan

Japan net sales decreased during 2022 compared to 2021 due to the weakness of
the yen relative to the U.S. dollar.

Rest of Asia Pacific

Rest of Asia Pacific net sales increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due
primarily to higher net sales of iPhone, Mac and Services. The weakness in
foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable year-over-
year impact on Rest of Asia Pacific net sales during 2022.

Total gross margin percentage| 43.3 | %| | 41.8 | %| | 38.2 | %  
  
Products Gross Margin

Products gross margin increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to
a different Products mix and higher Products volume, partially offset by the
weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.

Products gross margin percentage increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due
primarily to a different Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in
foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.

Services Gross Margin

Services gross margin increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to
higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.

Services gross margin percentage increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due
primarily to improved leverage and a different Services mix, partially offset
by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.

The Company's future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as
discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading "Risk
Factors." As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be
subject to volatility and downward pressure.

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (dollars in
millions):

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

Other Income/(Expense), Net

Other income/(expense), net ("OI&E") for 2022, 2021 and 2020 was as follows
(dollars in millions):

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

Total other income/(expense), net

| $| (334)| | | (229)| %| | $| 258 | | | (68)| %| | $| 803 |  
  
The decrease in OI&E during 2022 compared to 2021 was due primarily to higher
realized losses on debt securities, unfavorable fair value adjustments on
equity securities and higher interest expense, partially offset by higher
foreign exchange gains.

Provision for Income Taxes

Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income
tax rate for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (dollars in millions):

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| 2022| | 2021| | 2020

| 16.2 | %| | 13.3 | %| | 14.4 | %  
  
Statutory federal income tax rate

| 21 | %| | 21 | %| | 21 | %  
  
The Company's effective tax rate for 2022 was lower than the statutory federal
income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign
earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation and the impact of the
U.S. federal R&D credit, partially offset by state income taxes. The Company's
effective tax rate for 2021 was lower than the statutory federal income tax
rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax
benefits from share-based compensation and foreign-derived intangible income
deductions.

The Company's effective tax rate for 2022 was higher compared to 2021 due
primarily to a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings, including the
impact to U.S. foreign tax credits as a result of regulatory guidance issued
by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, and lower tax benefits from
foreign-derived intangible income deductions and share-based compensation.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted
marketable securities, which totaled $156.4 billion as of September 24, 2022,
along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt
markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital
return program over the next 12 months and beyond.

The Company's material cash requirements include the following contractual
obligations.

Debt

As of September 24, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with
varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $111.8 billion
(collectively the "Notes"), with $11.1 billion payable within 12 months.
Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.3 billion, with
$2.9 billion payable within 12 months.

The Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes ("Commercial
Paper") pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 24, 2022, the
Company had $10.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, all of which was
payable within 12 months.

Leases

The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities,
including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of
September 24, 2022, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.3
billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months.

Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 24

Manufacturing Purchase Obligations

The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies
for the Company's products and to perform final assembly and testing of
finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its
products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners
acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by
the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of September
24, 2022, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $71.1 billion,
with $68.4 billion payable within 12 months. The Company's manufacturing
purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.

Other Purchase Obligations

The Company's other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable
obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product
manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to internet services and
content creation. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had other purchase
obligations of $17.8 billion, with $6.8 billion payable within 12 months.

Deemed Repatriation Tax Payable

As of September 24, 2022, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable
imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Act") was $22.0
billion, with $5.3 billion expected to be paid within 12 months.

In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has a capital
return program authorized by the Board of Directors. The Program does not
obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September
24, 2022, the Company's quarterly cash dividend was $0.23 per share. The
Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to
declaration by the Board of Directors.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the Company's
discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results
require the Company's management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates
that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8
of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods
used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
assets and liabilities.

Uncertain Tax Positions

The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign
jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company's uncertain tax positions
involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP
and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters
related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries.
Although management believes the Company's reserves are reasonable, no
assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not
be different from that which is reflected in the Company's reserves. Reserves
are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing
of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner
inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on
the Company's financial condition and operating results.

Legal and Other Contingencies

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in
the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently
uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has
been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of
which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner
inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on
the Company's financial condition and operating results.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management

The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option
positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in
conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures.
Given the effective horizons of the Company's risk management activities and
the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these
positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting
from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the
recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not
coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying
economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company's
financial condition and operating results.

Interest Rate Risk

The Company's exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the
Company's investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is
exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, it is most affected by
fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the
interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated
with hedging and interest paid on the Company's debt.

The Company's investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation
of capital and supporting the Company's liquidity requirements. The Company
uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its
investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company
typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of
minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company's investment
policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the
amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful
assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company's investment
portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the
impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment
portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based
on investment positions as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, a
hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities
would result in a $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion incremental decline in the
fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be
realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.

As of September 24, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes and as
of September 25, 2021, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate
notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $110.1
billion and $118.7 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the
future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its
outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively
convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate
payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally
offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging
instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause
interest expense on the Company's debt as of September 24, 2022 and September
25, 2021 to increase by $201 million and $186 million on an annualized basis,
respectively.

Foreign Currency Risk

In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S.
dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a
strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company's net
sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the
Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive
pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency
exchange rates.

The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with
financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated
with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed
transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign
subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may
enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign
currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency-denominated debt
issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign
currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically
for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain
foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting
considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular
exposures.

Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 26

* * *

  

To provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain
of the Company's foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed
a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk ("VAR") model to assess the
potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of
using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price
paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss
in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company's foreign
currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model
is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation
and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model.
Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence,
a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $1.0 billion as of September 24, 2022,
compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $550 million as of
September 25, 2021. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for
hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are
generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.

Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company's investment
portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the
sensitivity analyses performed as of September 24, 2022 due to the inherent
limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in
interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company's actual
exposures and positions.

Apple Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation and Preparation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and
its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively "Apple" or the "Company").
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation
of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported.
Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior
period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes
have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation.

The Company's fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last
Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal
quarter every five or six years to realign the Company's fiscal quarters with
calendar quarters, which will occur in the first quarter of the Company's
fiscal year ending September 30, 2023. The Company's fiscal years 2022, 2021
and 2020 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to
particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company's fiscal
years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of
those fiscal years.

Revenue Recognition

Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and
other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it
expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred
to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a
present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of
ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most
of the Company's Products net sales, control transfers when products are
shipped. For the Company's Services net sales, control transfers over time as
services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is
collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement
of delivery of services, as applicable.

The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product
returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the
Company's expectations and historical experience.

For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent
promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates
revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-
alone selling prices ("SSPs"). When available, the Company uses observable
prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are
established that reflect the Company's best estimates of what the selling
prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on
a stand-alone basis. The Company's process for estimating SSPs without
observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the
unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation
including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar
offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-
specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance
obligation.

The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly
included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain
other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the
substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled
software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is
the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include
iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to
receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software
upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company
allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations
based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for
the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on
the Company's estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and
bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer,
which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the
product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is
deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period
they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware
and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at
the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services
and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as
incurred.

For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance
obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the
Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The
Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the
value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized
revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.

For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the
product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue
based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple
factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products,
including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains
inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring
acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the
App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company's other digital
content stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before
transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such
sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission
it retains.

The Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are
remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within
other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing
price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, and recognizes
expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will
ultimately vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be
found in Note 9, "Benefit Plans."

Earnings Per Share

The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per
share for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (net income in millions and shares in
thousands):

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

Diluted earnings per share

| $| 6.11 | | | $| 5.61 | | | $| 3.28 |  
  
The Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect
of potentially dilutive securities.

Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the
date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.

The Company's investments in marketable debt securities have been classified
and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies its marketable
debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument's
underlying contractual maturity date.

The Company's investments in marketable equity securities are classified based
on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current
operations.

The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification
method.

Inventories

Inventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.

Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 35

Restricted Marketable Securities

The Company considers marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal
or general use is legally restricted. The Company reports restricted
marketable securities as current or non-current marketable securities in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying
securities.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is
the shorter of 40 years or the remaining life of the building; between one and
five years for machinery and equipment, including manufacturing equipment; and
the shorter of the lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements.
Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range
from five to seven years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property,
plant and equipment was $8.7 billion, $9.5 billion and $9.7 billion during
2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging

All derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at
fair value. The accounting treatment for derivative gains and losses is based
on intended use and hedge designation.

Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of
cash flow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred in accumulated other
comprehensive income/(loss) ("AOCI") and subsequently reclassified into
earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line
item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For options designated as
cash flow hedges, the Company excludes time value from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness and recognizes it on a straight-line basis over the life of the
hedge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the
hedge relates. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the
assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other comprehensive
income/(loss) ("OCI").

Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of
fair value hedge effectiveness are recognized in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations line item to which the hedge relates along with offsetting
losses and gains related to the change in value of the hedged item. For
foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the
Company excludes the forward carry component from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness and recognizes it in other income/(expense), net ("OI&E") on a
straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of
amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in
OCI.

Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative
instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges are recognized in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations line items to which the derivative
instruments relate.

The Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair
values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company classifies cash flows
related to derivative instruments as operating activities in the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows.

Fair Value Measurements

The fair values of the Company's money market funds and certain marketable
equity securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the
Company's debt instruments and all other financial instruments, which
generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted
market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from
or corroborated by observable market data.

Income Taxes

The Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection
with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the U.S. Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Act").

Leases

The Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a
single lease component for leases of corporate, data center and retail
facilities. The discount rates related to the Company's lease liabilities are
generally based on estimates of the Company's incremental borrowing rate, as
the discount rates implicit in the Company's leases cannot be readily
determined.

Segment Reporting

The Company reports segment information based on the "management" approach.
The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management
for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's
reportable segments.

The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The
Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China,
Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South
America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East
and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest
of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in
the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments
provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one
is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company's
customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each
geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the
same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, "Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies."

The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net
sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally
based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail
stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each
segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and
operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses
are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are
incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense
and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded
from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as
research and development ("R&D"), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-
based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and
other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does
not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting
purposes.

Note 2 - Revenue

Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021
and 2020 were as follows (in millions):

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| 2022| | 2021| | 2020

Total net sales (4)

| $| 394,328 | | | $| 365,817 | | | $| 274,515 |  
  
(1)Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of
unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of
the respective product.

(2)Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple
TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod mini and accessories.

(3)Services net sales include sales from the Company's advertising, AppleCare,
cloud, digital content, payment and other services. Services net sales also
include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales
price of certain products.

(4)Includes $7.5 billion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in
deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021, $6.7 billion of revenue recognized
in 2021 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 26, 2020, and
$5.0 billion of revenue recognized in 2020 that was included in deferred
revenue as of September 28, 2019.

The Company's proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was
generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 11, "Segment
Information and Geographic Data" for 2022, 2021 and 2020, except in Greater
China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net
sales in 2022 and 2021.

As of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, the Company had total

three years and 2% in greater than three years.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging

The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business
exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may
choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including
accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging
particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more
than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign
exchange or interest rates.

Foreign Exchange Risk

To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other
instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The
Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure
associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12
months.

To protect the Company's foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable
securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company
may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments.
The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value
hedges. As of September 24, 2022, the maximum length of time over which the
Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for
term debt-related foreign currency transactions is 20 years.

The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated
as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign
currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain
assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.

Interest Rate Risk

To protect the Company's term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations
in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or
other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash
flow or fair value hedges.

The notional amounts of the Company's outstanding derivative instruments as of
September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions):

(1)Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are
included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(2)Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are
included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The derivative assets above represent the Company's gross credit exposure if
all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company
generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for
collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain
derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further
limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting
arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company's derivative
contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a
single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022,
the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company's
derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a
reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8
billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million.

The carrying amounts of the Company's hedged items in fair value hedges as of
September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions):

Accounts Receivable

Trade Receivables

The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-
party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and
mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The
Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the
Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain
instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company
attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for
certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to
support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly
between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the
Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related
to any of these arrangements.

As of September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or
more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10%. The Company's
cellular network carriers accounted for 44% and 42% of total trade receivables
as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, respectively.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables

The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing
vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture
subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company
purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of September 24, 2022,
the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total
vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54% and 13%. As of September
25, 2021, the Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or
more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 52%, 11% and
11%.

Uncertain Tax Positions

As of September 24, 2022, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits
was $16.8 billion, of which $8.0 billion, if recognized, would impact the
Company's effective tax rate. As of September 25, 2021, the total amount of
gross unrecognized tax benefits was $15.5 billion, of which $6.6 billion, if
recognized, would have impacted the Company's effective tax rate.

The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S.
federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. Tax years after
2017 for the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major
foreign jurisdictions, remain subject to examination. Although the timing of
resolution and/or closure of examinations is not certain, the Company believes
it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could
decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $4.8 billion.

European Commission State Aid Decision

On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that
Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and
2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two
subsidiaries of the Company (the "State Aid Decision"). The State Aid Decision
ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for
the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes,
effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions
from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1
billion, plus interest of €1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the
State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the
European Union (the "General Court"). On July 15, 2020, the General Court
annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European
Commission appealed the General Court's decision to the European Court of
Justice. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income
taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable
against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act.

On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister
for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other
countries. As of September 24, 2022, the adjusted recovery amount was €12.7
billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is
funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending
the conclusion of all legal proceedings. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents
and Marketable Securities section of Note 3, "Financial Instruments" for more
information.

Note 6 - Leases

The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities,
including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. These leases
typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain
multiyear renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise.

Payments under the Company's lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and
variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the
underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the
Company's operating leases were $1.9 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion
for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Lease costs associated with variable
payments on the Company's leases were $14.9 billion, $12.9 billion and $9.3
billion for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The Company made $1.8 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion of fixed cash
payments related to operating leases in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Noncash activities involving right-of-use ("ROU") assets obtained in exchange
for lease liabilities were $2.8 billion for 2022, $3.3 billion for 2021 and
$10.5 billion for 2020, including the impact of adopting the Financial
Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases

rate notes, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps to effectively
convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates on a portion of
these notes. Additionally, to manage foreign currency risk on certain of its
foreign currency-denominated notes, the Company has entered into foreign
currency swaps to effectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar-denominated
notes.

The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes,
amortization of the discount or premium and, if applicable, adjustments
related to hedging. The Company recognized $2.8 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.8
billion of interest expense on its term debt for 2022, 2021 and 2020,

Note 9 - Benefit Plans

2022 Employee Stock Plan

In the second quarter of 2022, shareholders approved the Apple Inc. 2022
Employee Stock Plan (the "2022 Plan"), which provides for broad-based equity
grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of
restricted stock units ("RSUs"), stock grants, performance-based awards, stock
options and stock appreciation rights. RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan
generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled
upon vesting in shares of the Company's common stock on a one-for-one basis.
RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan reduce the number of shares available for
grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. RSUs
canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase
the number of shares available for grant under the 2022 Plan utilizing a
factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. All RSUs
granted under the 2022 Plan have dividend equivalent rights ("DERs"), which
entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of
common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and
conditions as the underlying RSUs. A maximum of approximately 1.3 billion
shares were authorized for issuance pursuant to 2022 Plan awards at the time
the plan was approved on March 4, 2022.

2014 Employee Stock Plan

The Apple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the "2014 Plan") is a shareholder-
approved plan that provided for broad-based equity grants to employees,
including executive officers. The 2014 Plan permitted the granting of
substantially the same types of equity awards with substantially the same
terms as the 2022 Plan. The 2014 Plan also permitted the granting of cash
bonus awards. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company terminated the
authority to grant new awards under the 2014 Plan.

Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan

The Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the "Director Plan") is a
shareholder-approved plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs
or stock options to the Company's non-employee directors, (ii) provides for
automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the
Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting
of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively
change the value and relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the
initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number
of shares of the Company's common stock subject to these grants, in each case
within the limits set forth in the Director Plan and without further
shareholder approval. RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduce the number
of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the
number of RSUs granted. The Director Plan expires on November 12, 2027. All
RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled to DERs, which are subject
to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the underlying RSUs. A
maximum of approximately 45 million shares (split-adjusted) were authorized
for issuance pursuant to Director Plan awards at the time the plan was last
amended on November 9, 2021.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Purchase Plan") is a shareholder-
approved plan under which substantially all employees may voluntarily enroll
to purchase the Company's common stock through payroll deductions at a price
equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the
beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. An employee's payroll
deductions under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employee's
eligible compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of
stock during any calendar year. A maximum of approximately 230 million shares
(split-adjusted) were authorized for issuance under the Purchase Plan at the
time the plan was last amended and restated on March 10, 2015.

401(k) Plan

The Company's 401(k) Plan is a tax-qualified deferred compensation arrangement
under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan,
participating U.S. employees may contribute a portion of their eligible
earnings, subject to applicable U.S. Internal Revenue Service and plan limits.
The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee's contributions, depending on
length of service, up to a maximum of 6% of the employee's eligible earnings.

The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $18.2 billion,
$19.0 billion and $10.8 billion for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The
majority of RSUs that vested in 2022, 2021 and 2020 were net share settled
such that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the
employees' obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes,
and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares
withheld were approximately 41 million, 53 million and 56 million for 2022,
2021 and 2020, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their
respective vesting dates as determined by the Company's closing stock price.
Total payments to taxing authorities for employees' tax obligations were $6.4
billion, $6.8 billion and $3.9 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies

Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product

Although most components essential to the Company's business are generally
available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained
from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various
components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal
computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used
by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are
at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing
fluctuations.

The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its
competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom
components available from only one source. When a component or product uses
new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers'
yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The
continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all,
may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common
components instead of components customized to meet the Company's
requirements.

Substantially all of the Company's hardware products are manufactured by
outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac
computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.

Unconditional Purchase Obligations

The Company has entered into certain off-balance sheet commitments that
require the future purchase of goods or services ("unconditional purchase
obligations"). The Company's unconditional purchase obligations primarily
consist of payments for supplier arrangements, internet services and content
creation. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase
obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 24,
2022, are as follows (in millions):

| | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
2023| $| 13,488 |

2026| 6,780 |  
2027| 312 |  
Thereafter| 412 |  
Total| $| 27,286 |  
  
Contingencies

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have
arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully
resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of
management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may
have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded
accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as
of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, the related consolidated
statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 24, 2022, and
the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In
our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. at September 24, 2022 and
September 25, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended September 24, 2022, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the "PCAOB"), Apple Inc.'s
internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2022, based on
criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013
framework) and our report dated October 27, 2022 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.'s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.'s financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc.
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules
and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the
current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)
involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our
opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by
communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on
the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.

| Uncertain Tax Positions  
Description of the Matter|

As discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to
taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and
many state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 24, 2022, the total
amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $16.8 billion, of which $8.0
billion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.'s effective tax rate. In
accounting for uncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses significant judgment
in the interpretation and application of complex domestic and international
tax laws.

Auditing management's evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more
likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various
tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on
interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.

| | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
How We Addressed the  
Matter in Our Audit|

We tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions,
including controls over management's assessment as to whether tax positions
are more likely than not to be sustained, management's process to measure the
benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures.

To evaluate Apple Inc.'s assessment of which tax positions are more likely
than not to be sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading
and evaluating management's assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable,
Apple Inc.'s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis
and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax
subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of Apple
Inc.'s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and
experience with related taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also
received external legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters
with external advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated
Apple Inc.'s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 5 to the
financial statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Apple Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of
September 24, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the "COSO criteria"). In our
opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2022, based on the COSO
criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the "PCAOB"), the consolidated
balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021,
the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income,
shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended September 24, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated October
27, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

Apple Inc.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying
Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.'s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to
Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting
was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company's
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the
Company's management, the Company's principal executive officer and principal
financial officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act
were effective as of September 24, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files
or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii)
accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls

The Company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The Company's internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

(i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
Company's assets;

(ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and
that the Company's receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of the Company's management and directors; and

(iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company's internal controls will
prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all
control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any
evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to
the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes
in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the
effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based
on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013
framework). Based on the Company's assessment, management has concluded that
its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September
24, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance
with GAAP. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst
& Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company's internal control over
financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial
reporting during the fourth quarter of 2022, which were identified in
connection with management's evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules
13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control
over financial reporting.
