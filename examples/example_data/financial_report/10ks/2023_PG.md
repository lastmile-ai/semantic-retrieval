The Procter & Gamble Company 1

PART I

Item 1\. Business.

The Procter & Gamble Company (the Company) is focused on providing branded
products of superior quality and value to improve the lives of the world's
consumers, now and for generations to come. The Company was incorporated in
Ohio in 1905, having first been established as a New Jersey corporation in
1890, and was built from a business founded in Cincinnati in 1837 by William
Procter and James Gamble.

Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by
reference to Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A); and Notes 1 and 2 to
our Consolidated Financial Statements. Unless the context indicates otherwise,
the terms "Company," "P&G," "we," "our" or "us" as used herein refer to The
Procter & Gamble Company (the registrant) and its subsidiaries. Throughout
this Form 10-K, we incorporate by reference information from other documents
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and
current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments thereto, are filed electronically
with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains these reports
at: www.sec.gov. Reports can also be accessed through links from our website
at: www.pginvestor.com. P&G includes the website link solely as a textual
reference and the information on our website is not incorporated by reference
into this report.

Copies of these reports are also available, without charge, by contacting EQ
Shareowner Services, 1100 Centre Pointe Curve, Suite 101, Mendota, MN
55120-4100.

Financial Information about Segments

Information about our reportable segments can be found in the MD&A and Note 2
to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Narrative Description of Business

Business Model. Our business model is built to deliver balanced top- and
bottom-line growth and value creation. We rely on the continued growth and
success of existing brands and products, as well as the creation of new
innovative products and brands. We offer products in markets and industry
segments that are highly competitive. Our products are sold in approximately
180 countries and territories through numerous channels as well as direct-to-
consumer. Our growth strategy is to deliver meaningful and noticeable
superiority across five key vectors of our consumer proposition - product
performance, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and consumer and
customer value. We use our research and development (R&D) and consumer
insights to provide superior products and packaging. We utilize our marketing
and online presence to deliver superior brand messaging to our consumers. We
partner with our customers to deliver superior retail execution, both in-store
and online. In conjunction with the above vectors, we provide superior value
to consumers and our retail customers in each price tier in which we compete.
Productivity improvement is also critical to delivering our objectives of
balanced top- and bottom-line growth and value creation.

Key Product Categories. Information on key product categories can be found in
the MD&A and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Key Customers. Our customers include mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including
social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug
stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores
(including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies,
electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct to
consumers. Sales to Walmart Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately
15% of our total sales in 2023, 2022 and 2021. No other customer represents
more than 10% of our total sales. Our top ten customers accounted for 40% of
our total net sales in 2023 and 39% in 2022 and 2021.

Sources and Availability of Materials. Almost all of the raw and packaging
materials used by the Company are purchased from third parties, some of whom
are single-source suppliers. We produce certain raw materials, primarily
chemicals, for further use in the manufacturing process. In addition, fuel,
natural gas and derivative products are important commodities consumed in our
manufacturing processes and in the transportation of input materials and
finished products. The prices we pay for materials and other commodities are
subject to fluctuation. When prices for these items change, we may or may not
pass the change to our customers. The Company purchases a substantial variety
of other raw and packaging materials, none of which are material to our
business taken as a whole.

Trademarks and Patents. We own or have licenses under patents and registered
trademarks, which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses.
Some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and
processes used to manufacture our products. The trademarks are important to
the overall marketing and branding of our products. All major trademarks in
each business are registered. In part, our success can be attributed to the
existence and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and licenses.

Competitive Condition. The markets in which our products are sold are highly
competitive. Our products compete against similar products from many large and
small companies, including well-known global competitors. In many of the
markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete
against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. We
are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate,
often holding a leadership or significant market share position. We support
our products with advertising, promotions and other marketing vehicles to
build awareness and trial of our brands and products in conjunction with our
sales force. We believe this combination provides the

  

* * *

2 The Procter & Gamble Company

most efficient method of marketing for these types of products. Product
quality, performance, value and packaging are also important differentiating
factors.

Government Regulation. Our Company is subject to a wide variety of laws and
regulations across the countries in which we do business. In the United
States, many of our products and manufacturing operations are subject to one
or more federal or state regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). We are
also subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act, and antitrust and competition laws and regulations that
govern our dealings with suppliers, customers, competitors and government
officials.

In addition, many foreign jurisdictions in which we do business have
regulations and regulatory bodies that govern similar aspects of our
operations and products, in some cases to an even more significant degree. We
are also subject to expanding laws and regulations related to environmental
protection and other sustainability-related matters, non-financial reporting
and diligence, labor and employment, trade, taxation and data privacy and
protection, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) and similar regulations in states within the United States and in
countries around the world.

The Company has in place compliance programs and internal and external experts
to help guide our business in complying with these and other existing laws and
regulations that apply to us around the globe; and we have made, and plan to
continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with these laws and
regulations. We also expect that our many suppliers, consultants and other
third parties working on our behalf share our commitment to compliance, and we
have policies and procedures in place to manage these relationships, though
they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over operations and
governance. We do not expect that the Company's expenditures for compliance
with current government regulations, including current environmental
regulations, will have a material effect on our total capital expenditures,
earnings or competitive position in fiscal year 2024 as compared to prior
periods.

Human Capital. Our employees are a key source of competitive advantage. Their
actions, guided by our Purpose, Values and Principles (PVPs), are critical to
the long-term success of our business. We aim to retain our talented employees
by offering competitive compensation and benefits, strong career development
and a respectful and inclusive culture that provides equal opportunity for
all.

Our Board of Directors, through the Compensation and Leadership Development
Committee (C&LD Committee), provides oversight of the Company's policies and
strategy relating to talent including diversity, equality and inclusion as
well as the Company's compensation principles and practices. The C&LD
Committee also evaluates and approves the Company's compensation plans,
policies and programs applicable to our senior executives.

Employees

As of June 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 107,000 employees, an
increase of 1% versus the prior year due primarily to business growth. The
total number of employees is an estimate of total Company employees excluding
interns, co-ops, contractors and employees of joint ventures. 49% of our
employees are in manufacturing roles and 27% of our employees are located in
the United States. 41% of our global employees are women and 30% of our U.S.
employees identify as multicultural.

Training and Development

We focus on attracting, developing and retaining skilled and diverse talent,
both from universities and the broader market. We recruit from among the best
universities across markets in which we compete and are generally able to
select from the top talent. We focus on developing our employees by providing
a variety of job experiences, training programs and skill development
opportunities. Given our develop-from-within model for staffing most of our
senior leadership positions, it is particularly important for us to ensure
holistic growth and full engagement of our employees.

Diversity, Equality and Inclusion

As a consumer products company, we believe that it is important for our
workforce to reflect the diversity of our consumers worldwide. We also seek to
foster an inclusive work environment where each individual can bring their
authentic self, which helps drive innovation and enables us to better serve
our consumers. We aspire to achieve equal gender representation globally and
at key management and leadership levels. Within the U.S. workforce, our
aspiration is to achieve 40% multicultural representation overall as well as
at management and leadership levels.

Compensation and Benefits

Market-competitive compensation and reward programs are critical elements of
our employee value equation to attract and retain the best talent. Our total
rewards programs are based on the principles of paying for performance, paying
competitively versus peer companies that we compete with for talent in the
marketplace and focusing on long-term success through a combination of short-
term and long-term incentive programs. We also offer competitive benefit
programs, including retirement plans and health insurance in line with local
country practices with flexibility to accommodate the needs of a diverse
workforce.

Sustainability. Environmental sustainability is integrated into our business
strategy to offer consumers irresistibly superior products that are more
sustainable. Our aim is to deliver balanced top- and bottom-line growth, value
creation and key sustainability objectives. In 2021, the Company announced a
2040 net zero ambition and published a Climate Transition Action

  

* * *

The Procter & Gamble Company 3

Plan, which describes the Company's ongoing efforts toward reducing greenhouse
gas emissions across scopes 1 and 2 and elements of scope 3. This includes a
long-term objective of net zero emissions for scopes 1 and 2, elements of
scope 3 and interim goals to help us pace our progress. The Company has also
declared goals towards using renewable electricity for our operations,
reducing use of virgin petroleum-based plastic in packaging, increasing the
recyclability or reusability of packaging, responsible sourcing of key forest-
based commodities, improving efficiency of water usage in our operations and
driving a global portfolio of water restoration projects to address water
scarcity.

We use the standards and guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative,
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) industry specific standards
and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to inform
our sustainability and related disclosures included in this Annual Report, our
Proxy Statement and our sustainability reports. The "materiality" thresholds
in those standards and guidelines may differ from the concept of "materiality"
for purposes of the federal securities laws and disclosures required by the
Commission's rules in this Annual Report. References to our sustainability
reports and website are for informational purposes only and neither the
sustainability reports nor the other information on our website is
incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional
detailed information on our sustainability efforts can be found on our website
at https://pginvestor.com/esg.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

We discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes,
such as our business outlook and objectives in this Form 10-K, as well as in
our quarterly and annual reports, current reports on Form 8-K, press releases
and other written and oral communications. All statements, except for
historical and present factual information, are "forward-looking statements"
and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the
time the statements are made, which may become outdated or incomplete. We
assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of
new information, future events or other factors, except to the extent required
by law. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors
must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations.

The following discussion of "risk factors" identifies significant factors that
may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future
financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with
Management's Discussion and Analysis and the Consolidated Financial Statements
and related Notes incorporated in this report. The following discussion of
risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are
important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. These and
other factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the
forward-looking statements and from historical trends, perhaps materially.

MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND RELATED FINANCIAL RISKS

Our business is subject to numerous risks as a result of having significant
operations and sales in international markets, including foreign currency
fluctuations, currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility.

We are a global company, with operations in approximately 70 countries and
products sold in approximately 180 countries and territories around the world.
We hold assets, incur liabilities, generate sales and pay expenses in a
variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and our operations outside
the U.S. generate more than 50% of our annual net sales. Fluctuations in
exchange rates for foreign currencies have and could continue to reduce the
U.S. dollar value of sales, earnings and cash flows we receive from non-U.S.
markets, increase our supply costs (as measured in U.S. dollars) in those
markets, negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise
adversely impact our business results or financial condition. Further, we have
a significant amount of foreign currency debt and derivatives as part of our
capital markets activities. The maturity cash outflows of these instruments
could be adversely impacted by significant appreciation of foreign currency
exchange rates (particularly the Euro), which could adversely impact our
overall cash flows. Moreover, discriminatory or conflicting fiscal or trade
policies in different countries, including changes to tariffs and existing
trade policies and agreements, could adversely affect our results. See also
the Results of Operations and Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity
sections of the MD&A and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related
Notes.

We also have businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number
of countries with currency exchange, import authorization, pricing or other
controls or restrictions, such as Egypt, Argentina and Pakistan. Our results
of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted
if we are unable to successfully manage such controls and restrictions,
continue existing business operations and repatriate earnings from overseas,
or if new or increased tariffs, quotas, exchange or price controls, trade
barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business.

Additionally, our business, operations or employees have been and could
continue to be adversely affected (including by the need to de-consolidate or
even exit certain businesses in particular countries) by geopolitical
conflicts, political volatility, trade controls, labor market disruptions or
other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions. This could
include political instability, upheaval or acts of war (such as the Russia-
Ukraine War) and the related government and other entity responses, broad
economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or
deterioration in the creditworthiness of local governments, particularly in
emerging markets.

Uncertain economic or social conditions may adversely impact demand for our
products or cause our customers and other business partners to suffer
financial hardship, which could adversely impact our business.

Our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products
related to one or more significant local, regional or global economic or
social disruptions. These disruptions have included and may in the future
include: a slow-down,

recession or inflationary pressures in the general economy; reduced market
growth rates; tighter credit markets for our suppliers, vendors or customers;
a significant shift in government policies; significant social unrest; the
deterioration of economic relations between countries or regions; potential
negative consumer sentiment toward non-local products or sources; or the
inability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial
intermediaries to pay funds to or collect funds from our customers, vendors
and suppliers. Additionally, these and other economic conditions may cause our
suppliers, distributors, contractors or other third-party partners to suffer
financial or operational difficulties that they cannot overcome, resulting in
their inability to provide us with the materials and services we need, in
which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Customers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic conditions such
that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection
cycles. In addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient sales, income and
cash flow, it could affect the Company's ability to achieve expected share
repurchase and dividend payments.

Disruptions in credit markets or to our banking partners or changes to our
credit ratings may reduce our access to credit or overall liquidity.

A disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating
could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access
capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, which could
adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase
our cost of capital. In addition, we rely on top-tier banking partners in key
markets around the world, who themselves face economic, societal, political
and other risks, for access to credit and to facilitate collection, payment
and supply chain finance programs. A disruption to one or more of these top-
tier partners could impact our ability to draw on existing credit facilities
or otherwise adversely affect our cash flows or the cash flows of our
customers and vendors.

Changing political and geopolitical conditions could adversely impact our
business and financial results.

Changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell
or distribute our products, as well as changing geopolitical conditions, may
be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business and financial
results. Results of elections, referendums, sanctions or other political
processes and pressures in certain markets in which our products are
manufactured, sold or distributed could create uncertainty regarding how
existing governmental policies, laws and regulations may change, including
with respect to sanctions, taxes, tariffs, import and export controls and the
general movement of goods, materials, services, capital, data and people
between countries. The potential implications of such uncertainty, which
include, among others, exchange rate fluctuations, new or increased tariffs,
trade barriers and market contraction, could adversely affect the Company's
results of operations and cash flows.

The Company operates a global business with sales, manufacturing, distribution
and research and development organizations globally that contribute to our
overall growth. If geopolitical tensions and trade controls were to increase
or disrupt our business in markets where we have significant sales or
operations, including disruptions due to governmental responses to such
conflicts (such as the imposition of sanctions, retaliatory tariffs, increased
business licensing requirements or limitations on profits), such disruptions
could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

The war between Russia and Ukraine has adversely impacted and could continue
to adversely impact our business and financial results.

The war between Russia and Ukraine has negatively impacted, and the situation
it generates may continue to negatively impact, our operations. Beginning in
March 2022, the Company reduced its product portfolio, discontinued new
capital investments and suspended media, advertising and promotional activity
in Russia. Future impacts to the Company are difficult to predict due to the
high level of uncertainty as to how the overall situation will evolve. Within
Ukraine, there is a possibility of physical damage and destruction of our two
manufacturing facilities, our distribution centers or those of our customers.
We may not be able to operate our manufacturing sites and source raw materials
from our suppliers or ship finished products to our customers. Within Russia,
we may reduce further or discontinue our operations due to sanctions and
export controls and counter-sanctions, monetary, currency or payment controls,
restrictions on access to financial institutions, supply and transportation
challenges or other circumstances and considerations. Ultimately, these could
result in loss of assets or impairments of our manufacturing plants and fixed
assets or write-downs of other operating assets and working capital.

The war between Russia and Ukraine could also amplify or affect the other risk
factors set forth in this Part I, Item 1A, including, but not limited to,
foreign exchange volatility, disruptions to the financial and credit markets,
energy supply and supply chain disruptions, increased risks of an information
security or operational technology incident, cost fluctuations and commodity
cost increases and increased costs to ensure compliance with global and local
laws and regulations. The occurrence of any of these risks, combined with the
increased impact from the war between Russia and Ukraine, could adversely
impact our business and financial results.

More broadly, there could be additional negative impacts to our net sales,
earnings and cash flows should the situation worsen, including, among other
potential impacts, economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or
globally due to inflationary pressures, energy and supply chain cost increases
or the geographic proximity of the war relative to the rest of Europe.

BUSINESS OPERATIONS RISKS

Our business results depend on our ability to manage disruptions in our global
supply chain.

Our ability to meet our customers' needs and achieve cost targets depends on
our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including
execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole
manufacturing plant

The Procter & Gamble Company 5

arrangements. The loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply
arrangements, including for issues such as labor disputes or controversies,
loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, discontinuity or disruptions in
our internal information and data systems or those of our suppliers,
cybersecurity incidents, inability to procure sufficient raw or input
materials (including water, recycled materials and materials that meet our
labor standards), significant changes in trade policy, natural disasters,
increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events due to climate
change or otherwise, acts of war or terrorism, disease outbreaks or other
external factors over which we have no control, have at times interrupted and
could, in the future, interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed
and remedied, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our
business results.

Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in the
prices of commodities (including certain petroleum-derived materials like
resins and paper-based materials like pulp) and raw and packaging materials
and the costs of labor, transportation (including trucks and containers),
energy, pension and healthcare. Inflation pressures could also result in
increases in these input costs. Therefore, our business results depend, in
part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing
actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and
improving margins and market share. Failure to manage these fluctuations and
to anticipate consumer reaction to our management of these fluctuations could
adversely impact our results of operations or cash flows.

The ability to achieve our business objectives depends on how well we can
compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and
channels.

The consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all of our
categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors.
As a result, we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments
in which we operate, which may result in challenges in maintaining sales and
profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully
respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, including pricing,
promotional incentives, product delivery windows and trade terms. In addition,
evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer
preferences as well as market dynamics, which, for example, may be seen in the
growing consumer preference for shopping online, ease of competitive entry
into certain categories and growth in hard discounter channels. Failure to
successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends and
effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models,
particularly e-commerce and mobile or social commerce applications, could
negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows.

A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our
products could have a significant impact on our business.

We sell most of our products via retail customers, which include mass
merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery
stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors,
wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores),
high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional
channels. Our success depends on our ability to successfully manage
relationships with our retail trade customers, which includes our ability to
offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our
pricing and profitability targets. Continued concentration among our retail
customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business,
and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a
key customer on trade terms and principles. Our business could also be
negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the
inventory level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of
increased offerings of other branded manufacturers, private label brands and
generic non-branded products or for other reasons, significantly tighten
product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption.

If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our brands erodes
significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.

The Company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands, form the
foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other
constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. The quality and
safety of our products are critical to our business. Many of our brands have
worldwide recognition and our financial success directly depends on the
success of our brands. The success of our brands can suffer if our marketing
plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image
or its ability to attract consumers. Our results of operations or cash flows
could also be negatively impacted if the Company or one of our brands suffers
substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall,
product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product
misuse, changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients, negative
perceptions of packaging (such as plastic and other petroleum-based
materials), lack of recyclability or other environmental impacts, concerns
about actual or alleged labor or equality and inclusion practices, privacy
lapses or data breaches, allegations of product tampering or the distribution
and sale of counterfeit products. Additionally, negative or inaccurate
postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company
or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the
reputation of our brands or the Company. If we are unable to effectively
manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality,
ingredients, efficacy, environmental or social impacts or similar matters,
sentiments toward the Company or our products could be negatively impacted,
and our results of operations or cash flows could suffer. Our Company also
devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are consistent with our
corporate values and are designed to strengthen our business and protect and
preserve our reputation, including programs driving ethics and corporate
responsibility, strong communities, equality and inclusion and environmental
sustainability. While the Company has many programs and

  

* * *

6 The Procter & Gamble Company

initiatives to further these goals, our ability to achieve these goals is
impacted in part by the actions and efforts of third parties including local
and other governmental authorities, suppliers, vendors and customers. Consumer
or broader stakeholder perceptions of these programs and initiatives widely
vary and could adversely affect our business. If these programs are not
executed as planned or suffer negative publicity, the Company's reputation and
results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted.

We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates
additional risk.

Due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with
third parties, including our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors,
contractors, commercial banks, joint venture partners and external business
partners, for certain functions. If we are unable to effectively manage our
third-party relationships and the agreements under which our third-party
partners operate, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely
impacted. Further, failure of these third parties to meet their obligations to
the Company or substantial disruptions in the relationships between the
Company and these third parties could adversely impact our operations and
financial results. Additionally, while we have policies and procedures for
managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of
control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby
potentially increasing our financial, legal, reputational and operational
risk.

A significant information security or operational technology incident,
including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of one or more key
information or operations technology systems, networks, hardware, processes
and/or associated sites owned or operated by the Company or one of its service
providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation.

We rely extensively on information and operational technology (IT/OT) systems,
networks and services, including internet and intranet sites, data hosting and
processing facilities and technologies, physical security systems and other
hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, many of which are
managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties or their vendors, to
assist in conducting our business. The various uses of these IT/OT systems,
networks and services include, but are not limited to:

•ordering and managing materials from suppliers;

•converting materials to finished products;

•shipping products to customers;

•marketing and selling products to consumers;

•collecting, transferring, storing and/or processing customer, consumer,
employee, vendor, investor and other stakeholder information and personal
data, including such data from persons covered by an expanding landscape of
privacy and data regulations, such as citizens of the European Union who are
covered by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), residents of
California covered by the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), citizens of
China covered by the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) and citizens
of Brazil covered by the General Personal Data Protection Law (LGPD);

•summarizing and reporting results of operations, including financial
reporting;

•managing our banking and other cash liquidity systems and platforms;

•hosting, processing and sharing, as appropriate, confidential and proprietary
research, business plans and financial information;

•collaborating via an online and efficient means of global business
communications;

•complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements;

•providing data security; and

•handling other processes necessary to manage our business.

Numerous and evolving information security threats, including advanced
persistent cybersecurity threats, pose a risk to the security of our services,
systems, networks and supply chain, as well as to the confidentiality,
availability and integrity of our data and of our critical business
operations. In addition, because the techniques, tools and tactics used in
cyber-attacks frequently change and may be difficult to detect for periods of
time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate
preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after such an attack.

Our IT/OT databases and systems and our third-party providers' databases and
systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to advanced
computer viruses or other malicious codes, ransomware, unauthorized access
attempts, denial of service attacks, phishing, social engineering, hacking and
other cyber-attacks. Such attacks may originate from outside parties, hackers,
criminal organizations or other threat actors, including nation states. In
addition, insider actors - malicious or otherwise - could cause technical
disruptions and/or confidential data leakage. We cannot guarantee that our
security efforts or the security efforts of our third-party providers will
prevent material breaches, operational incidents or other breakdowns to our or
our third-party providers' IT/OT databases or systems.

A breach of our data security systems or failure of our IT/OT databases and
systems may have a material adverse impact on our business operations and
financial results. If the IT/OT systems, networks or service providers we rely
upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations, or
if we or one of our third-party providers suffer significant unavailability of
key operations, or inadvertent disclosure of, lack of integrity of, or loss of
our sensitive business or stakeholder information,

  

* * *

The Procter & Gamble Company 7

including personal information, due to any number of causes, including
catastrophic events, natural disasters, power outages, computer and
telecommunications failures, improper data handling, viruses, phishing
attempts, cyber-attacks, malware and ransomware attacks, security breaches,
security incidents or employee error or malfeasance, and our business
continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis,
we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations and be exposed
to reputational, competitive, operational, financial and business harm as well
as litigation and regulatory action. If our critical IT systems or back-up
systems or those of our third-party vendors are damaged or cease to function
properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace
them.

In addition, if a ransomware attack or other cybersecurity incident occurs,
either internally or at our third-party technology service providers, we could
be prevented from accessing our data or systems, which may cause interruptions
or delays in our business operations, cause us to incur remediation costs,
subject us to demands to pay a ransom or damage our reputation. In addition,
such events could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential
information or stakeholder information, including personal information, and we
may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or
misappropriated information belonging to us or to our partners, our employees,
customers and suppliers. Additionally, we could be exposed to potential
liability, litigation, governmental inquiries, investigations or regulatory
enforcement actions; and we could be subject to payment of fines or other
penalties, legal claims by our suppliers, customers or employees and
significant remediation costs.

Periodically, we also upgrade our IT/OT systems or adopt new technologies. If
such a new system or technology does not function properly or otherwise
exposes us to increased cybersecurity breaches and failures, it could affect
our ability to order materials, make and ship orders and process payments in
addition to other operational and information integrity and loss issues. The
costs and operational consequences of responding to the above items and
implementing remediation measures could be significant and could adversely
impact our results of operations and cash flows.

We must successfully manage the demand, supply and operational challenges
associated with the effects of any future disease outbreak, including
epidemics, pandemics or similar widespread public health concerns.

Our business may be negatively impacted by the fear of exposure to or actual
effects of a disease outbreak, epidemic, pandemic or similar widespread public
health concern. These impacts may include, but are not limited to:

•Significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for one
or more of our products, which may be caused by, among other things: the
temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness,
quarantine or other travel restrictions or financial hardship, shifts in
demand away from one or more of our more discretionary or higher priced
products to lower priced products, or stockpiling or similar pantry-loading
activity. If prolonged, such impacts can further increase the difficulty of
business or operations planning and may adversely impact our results of
operations and cash flows; or

•Significant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we
manufacture, sell or distribute our products, including quarantines,
import/export restrictions, price controls, or governmental or regulatory
actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and
manufacturing facilities, restrict our employees' ability to travel or perform
necessary business functions, or otherwise prevent our third-party partners,
suppliers or customers from sufficiently staffing operations.

Despite efforts to manage and remedy these impacts, their ultimate impact also
depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and
severity of any such outbreak as well as third-party actions taken to contain
its spread and mitigate its public health effects.

BUSINESS STRATEGY & ORGANIZATIONAL RISKS

Our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product,
marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive
innovation, evolving digital marketing and selling platforms and changing
consumer habits.

We are a consumer products company that relies on continued global demand for
our brands and products. Achieving our business results depends, in part, on
successfully developing, introducing and marketing new products and on making
significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes. The
success of such innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate
customer and consumer acceptance and trends, to obtain, maintain and enforce
necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing upon the
intellectual property rights of others and to continue to deliver efficient
and effective marketing across evolving media and mobile platforms with
dynamic and increasingly more restrictive privacy requirements. We must also
successfully respond to technological advances made by, and intellectual
property rights granted to, competitors, customers and vendors. Failure to
continually innovate, improve and respond to competitive moves, platform
evolution and changing consumer habits could compromise our competitive
position and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations
or cash flows.

We must successfully manage ongoing acquisition, joint venture and divestiture
activities.

As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business
model includes a certain level of acquisition, joint venture and divestiture
activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these
activities, while at the same time delivering against our business objectives.
Specifically, our financial results have been, and in the future could be,
adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings
associated with divested brands or dissolution of joint ventures. Our results
of operations and cash flows have been, and in the future could also be,
impacted by acquisitions or joint

  

* * *

8 The Procter & Gamble Company

venture activities, if: 1) changes in the cash flows or other market-based
assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value, or 2)
we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated
with such acquisitions and joint ventures, including as a result of
integration and collaboration challenges, which could also result in an
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.

Our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage productivity
improvements and ongoing organizational change, including attracting and
retaining key talent as part of our overall succession planning.

Our financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements and
cost savings, including staffing adjustments and employee departures. Failure
to deliver these planned productivity improvements and cost savings, while
continuing to invest in business growth, could adversely impact our results of
operations and cash flows. Additionally, successfully executing organizational
change, management transitions at leadership levels of the Company and
motivation and retention of key employees is critical to our business success.
Factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers
of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, competition
from other employers and availability of qualified individuals. Our success
depends on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide
uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. This includes
developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets
where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and
competition for these resources is intense as well as continuing the
development and execution of robust leadership succession plans.

LEGAL & REGULATORY RISKS

We must successfully manage compliance with current and expanding laws and
regulations, as well as manage new and pending legal and regulatory matters in
the U.S. and abroad.

Our business is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across the
countries in which we do business, including those laws and regulations
involving intellectual property, product liability, product composition or
formulation, packaging content or corporate responsibility for packaging and
product disposal, marketing, antitrust and competition, privacy, data
protection, environmental (including increasing focus on the climate, water
and waste impacts of consumer packaged goods companies' operations and
products), employment, healthcare, anti-bribery and anti-corruption (including
interactions with health care professionals and government officials as well
as corresponding internal controls and record-keeping requirements), trade
(including tariffs, sanctions and export controls), tax, accounting and
financial reporting or other matters. In addition, increasing governmental and
societal attention to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters,
including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence and
disclosure on topics such as climate change, waste production, water usage,
human capital, labor and risk oversight, could expand the nature, scope and
complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess and report.
These and other rapidly changing laws, regulations, policies and related
interpretations as well as increased enforcement actions by various
governmental and regulatory agencies, create challenges for the Company, may
alter the environment in which we do business, may increase the ongoing costs
and complexities of compliance including by requiring investments in
technology or other compliance systems, and may ultimately result in the need
to cease manufacturing, sales or other business activities in certain
jurisdictions, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash
flows. If we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with
all laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, it could
negatively impact our reputation and our business results. Additionally, we
are currently, and in the future may be, subject to a number of inquiries,
investigations, claims, proceedings and requests for information from
governmental agencies or private parties, the adverse outcomes of which could
harm our business. Failure to successfully manage these new or pending
regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant
liability or damage to our reputation may materially adversely impact our
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, if new
or pending legal or regulatory matters result in fines or costs in excess of
the amounts accrued to date, that may also materially impact our results of
operations and financial position.

Changes in applicable tax laws and regulations and resolutions of tax disputes
could negatively affect our financial results.

The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign
jurisdictions. Changes in the various tax laws can and do occur. For example,
in December 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation
commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the U.S. Tax Act). The
changes included in the U.S. Tax Act were broad and complex. Under the current
U.S. presidential administration, comprehensive federal income tax reform has
been proposed, including an increase in the U.S. Federal corporate income tax
rate, elimination of certain investment incentives and an increase in U.S.
taxation of non-U.S. earnings. While these proposals are controversial, likely
to change during the legislative process and may prove difficult to enact as
proposed in the current closely divided U.S. Congress, their impact could
nonetheless be significant.

Additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine each
country's jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are subject to
potential evolution. An outgrowth of the original Base Erosion and Profit
Shifting (BEPS) project is a project undertaken by the approximately 140
member countries of the expanded Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) Inclusive Framework focused on "Addressing the Challenges
of the Digitalization of the Economy." The breadth of this project extends
beyond pure digital businesses and, as proposed, would likely impact a large
portion of multinational businesses by potentially redefining jurisdictional
taxation rights in market countries and establishing a global minimum tax. In
December 2022, the European Union (EU) approved a directive requiring member
states to incorporate a 15% global minimum tax into their respective domestic
laws effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 31, 2023. In

  

* * *

The Procter & Gamble Company 9

addition, several non-EU countries have recently proposed and/or adopted
legislation consistent with the global minimum tax framework. Important
details of these minimum tax developments are still to be determined and, in
some cases, enactment and timing remain uncertain.

While it is too early to assess the overall impact of these potential changes,
as these and other tax laws and related regulations are revised, enacted and
implemented, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows
could be materially impacted.

Furthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both foreign and
domestic tax authorities. While we believe our tax positions will be
sustained, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, including
maintaining our intended tax treatment of divestiture transactions such as the
fiscal 2017 Beauty Brands transaction with Coty, may differ materially from
the tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements, which could
adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

None.

Item 2\. Properties.

In the U.S., we own and operate 24 manufacturing sites located in 18 different
states. In addition, we own and operate 80 manufacturing sites in 34 other
countries. Many of the domestic and international sites manufacture products
for multiple businesses. Beauty products are manufactured at 23 of these
locations; Grooming products at 17; Health Care products at 20; Fabric & Home
Care products at 37; and Baby, Feminine & Family Care products at 37. We own
our Corporate headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio. We own or lease our principal
regional general offices in Switzerland, Panama, Singapore, China and the
United Arab Emirates. We own or lease our principal regional shared service
centers in Costa Rica, the United Kingdom and the Philippines. Management
believes that the Company's sites are adequate to support the business and
that the properties and equipment have been well maintained.

Item 3\. Legal Proceedings.

The Company is subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and
claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters,
including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising,
contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters, labor and
employment matters and tax. In addition, SEC regulations require that we
disclose certain environmental proceedings arising under Federal, State or
local law when a governmental authority is a party and such proceeding
involves potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes
will exceed a certain threshold ($1 million or more). There are no relevant
matters to disclose under this Item for this period. See Note 13 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements for information on certain legal proceedings
for which there are contingencies.

This item should be read in conjunction with the Company's Risk Factors in
Part I, Item 1A for additional information.

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosure.

Not applicable.

Company's compensation and benefit plans. The share repurchases were
authorized pursuant to a resolution issued by the Company's Board of Directors
and were financed through a combination of operating cash flows and issuance
of debt. The total value of the shares purchased under the share repurchase
plan was $7.4 billion. The share repurchase plan ended on June 30, 2023.

Purpose, Approach and Non-GAAP Measures

The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an
understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to
year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in
conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying
Notes. The MD&A is organized in the following sections:

•Overview

•Summary of 2023 Results

•Economic Conditions and Uncertainties

•Results of Operations

•Segment Results

•Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity

•Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

•Other Information

Throughout the MD&A we refer to measures used by management to evaluate
performance, including unit volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted
net earnings per common share (diluted EPS) and operating cash flow. We also
refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP),
consisting of organic sales growth, core earnings per share (Core EPS),
adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. Organic
sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and
divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Core EPS is
diluted EPS excluding certain items that are not judged by management to be
part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. Adjusted free cash flow
is operating cash flow less

14 The Procter & Gamble Company

capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting
from the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of
adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding certain one-time items. We
believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about
our underlying results and trends as well as insight to some of the metrics
used to evaluate management. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides
more details on the use and the derivation of these measures as well as
reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.

Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to
evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the
availability and comparability of share and consumption information.
References to market share and consumption in the MD&A are based on a
combination of vendor-purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data
in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references
represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a
constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category. The
Company measures quarter and fiscal year-to-date market shares through the
most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically
reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the
reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate drivers
of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes
in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and certain
one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic
sales.

OVERVIEW

Procter & Gamble is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods
industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior
quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in
approximately 180 countries and territories primarily through mass
merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery
stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors,
wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores),
high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional
channels. We also sell direct to individual consumers. We have on-the-ground
operations in approximately 70 countries.

Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local
competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our
products, we compete against other branded products, as well as retailers'
private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we
compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium,
premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We believe we are well positioned
in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a
leadership or significant market share position.

Organizational Structure

Our organizational structure is comprised of Sector Business Units (SBUs),
Enterprise Markets (EMs), Corporate Functions (CF) and Global Business
Services (GBS).

Sector Business Units

The Company's ten product categories are organized into five SBUs and five
reportable segments (under U.S. GAAP): Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric &
Home Care; and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. The SBUs are responsible for
global brand strategy, product upgrades and innovation, marketing plans and
supply chain. They have direct profit responsibility for markets (referred to
as Focus Markets) representing the large majority of the Company's sales and
earnings and are also responsible for innovation plans, supply plans and
operating frameworks to drive growth and value creation in the remaining
markets (referred to as Enterprise Markets). Throughout the MD&A, we reference
business results by region, which are comprised of North America, Europe,
Greater China, Latin America, Asia Pacific and India, Middle East and Africa
(IMEA).

16 The Procter & Gamble Company

Enterprise Markets

Enterprise Markets are responsible for sales and profit delivery in specific
countries, supported by SBU-agreed innovation and supply chain plans, along
with scaled services like planning, distribution and customer management.

Corporate Functions

Corporate Functions provides company-level strategy and portfolio analysis,
corporate accounting, treasury, tax, external relations, governance, human
resources, information technology and legal services.

Global Business Services

Global Business Services provides scaled services in technology, process and
data tools to enable the SBUs, the EMs and CF to better serve consumers and
customers. The GBS organization is responsible for providing world-class
services and solutions that drive value for P&G.

Strategic Focus

Procter & Gamble aspires to serve the world's consumers better than our best
competitors in every category and in every country in which we compete and, as
a result, deliver total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer
group. Delivering and sustaining leadership levels of shareholder value
creation requires balanced top- and bottom-line growth and strong cash
generation.

The Company competes in daily-use product categories where performance plays a
significant role in the consumer's choice of brands, and therefore, play to
P&G's strengths. Our focused portfolio of businesses consists of ten product
categories where P&G has leading market positions, strong brands and consumer-
meaningful product technologies.

Within these categories, our strategic choices are focused on delighting and
winning with consumers. Our consumers are at the center of everything we do.
We win with consumers by delivering irresistible superiority across five key
vectors - product performance, packaging, brand communication, retail
execution and value. Winning with consumers around the world and against our
best competitors requires superior innovation. Innovation has always been, and
continues to be, P&G's lifeblood. Superior products delivered with superior
execution drive market growth, value creation for retailers and build share
growth for P&G.

Ongoing productivity improvement is crucial to delivering our balanced top-
and bottom-line growth, cash generation and value creation objectives.
Productivity improvement enables investments to strengthen the superiority of
our brands via product and packaging innovation, more efficient and effective
supply chains, equity and awareness-building brand advertising and other
programs and expansion of sales coverage and R&D programs. Productivity
improvements also enable us to mitigate challenging cost environments
(including periods of increasing commodity and negative foreign exchange
impacts). Our objective is to drive productivity improvements across all
elements of the statement of earnings and balance sheet, including cost of
goods sold, marketing and promotional spending, overhead costs and capital
spending.

We act with agility and are constructively disrupting our highly competitive
industry and the way we do business, including how we innovate, communicate
and leverage new technologies, to create more value.

We are improving operational effectiveness and organizational culture through
enhanced clarity of roles and responsibilities, accountability and incentive
compensation programs.

Additionally, within this strategy of superiority, productivity, constructive
disruption and organization, we have declared four focus areas to strengthen
our performance going forward. These are 1) leveraging environmental
sustainability as an additional driver of superior performing products and
packaging innovations, 2) increasing digital acumen to drive consumer and
customer preference, reduce cost and enable rapid and efficient decision
making, 3) developing next-level supply chain capabilities to enable
flexibility, agility, resilience and a new level of productivity and 4)
delivering employee value equation for all gender identities, races,
ethnicities, sexual orientations, ages and abilities for all roles to ensure
we continue to attract, retain and develop the best talent.

We believe this strategy is right for the long-term health of the Company and
our objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of
our peer group.

The Company expects the delivery of the following long-term growth algorithm
will result in total shareholder returns in the top third of the competitive,
fast-moving consumer goods peer group:

•Organic sales growth above market growth rates in the categories and
geographies in which we compete;

•Core EPS growth of mid-to-high single digits; and

•Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater.

While periods of significant macroeconomic pressures may cause short-term
results to deviate from the long-term growth algorithm, we intend to maintain
a disciplined approach to investing in our business.

•Net sales increased 2% to $82.0 billion versus the prior year. The net sales
growth was driven by a mid-single-digit increase in Health Care, low single-
digit increases in Fabric & Home Care, Baby, Feminine & Family Care and
Beauty, partially offset by a low single-digit decrease in Grooming. Organic
sales, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign
exchange, increased 7%. Organic sales increased high single digits in Health
Care and Fabric & Home Care and mid-single digits in Baby, Feminine & Family
Care, Beauty and Grooming.

•Operating income increased $321 million, or 2%, to $18.1 billion versus year
ago due to the increase in net sales, partially offset by a modest decrease in
operating margin.

•Net earnings decreased modestly by $55 million to $14.7 billion versus year
ago as the increase in operating income was more than fully offset by a higher
effective tax rate. Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by
approximately $1.4 billion.

•Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble decreased $89 million, or 1%,
to $14.7 billion versus the prior year due primarily to the decrease in net
earnings.

•Diluted EPS increased 2% to $5.90 as the decrease in net earnings was more
than offset by a reduction in shares outstanding.

•Cash flow from operating activities was $16.8 billion.

◦ Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital
expenditures and certain other impacts, was $14.0 billion.

◦ Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is the ratio of adjusted free
cash flow to net earnings, was 95%.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES

We discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes,
such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports,
press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements,
except for historical and present factual information, are "forward-looking
statements" and are based on financial data and our business plans available
only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or
incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements
as a result of new information, future events or other factors, except as
required by law. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and
investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our
expectations. For more information on risk factors that could impact our
results, please refer to "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

Global Economic Conditions. Our products are sold in numerous countries across
North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia, Australia and Africa, with more
than half our sales generated outside the United States. Our largest
international markets are Greater China, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and
Germany and collectively comprise more than 20% of our net sales in fiscal
2023. As such, we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factors,
geopolitical tensions, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign
exchange fluctuations. We are also exposed to market risks from operating in
challenging environments including unstable economic, political and social
conditions, civil unrest, natural disasters, debt and credit issues and
currency controls or fluctuations. These risks can reduce our net sales or
erode our operating margins and consequently reduce our net earnings and cash
flows.

Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to
changes in commodity and input material prices, transportation costs, other
broader inflationary impacts and our own productivity efforts. We have
significant exposures to certain commodities and input materials, in
particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials
like pulp. Volatility in the market price of these commodities and input
materials has a direct impact on our costs. Disruptions in our manufacturing,
supply and distribution operations due to energy shortages, natural disasters,
labor or freight constraints have impacted our costs and could do so in the
future. New or increased legal or regulatory requirements, along with
initiatives to meet our sustainability goals, could also result in increased
costs due to higher material costs and investments in facilities and
equipment. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans,
including supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce
optimization. Increased pricing in response to certain inflationary or cost
increases may also offset portions of the cost impacts; however, such price
increases may impact product consumption. If we are unable to manage cost
impacts through pricing actions and consistent productivity improvements, it
may adversely impact our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net
earnings and cash flows.

18 The Procter & Gamble Company

Foreign Exchange. We have significant translation and transaction exposure to
the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange
rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do
not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures
relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency
other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-
related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the
functional currency. In the past three years, weakening of certain foreign
currencies versus the U.S. dollar has resulted in significant foreign exchange
impacts leading to lower net sales, net earnings and cash flows. Certain
countries that recently had and are currently experiencing significant
exchange rate fluctuations include Argentina, Brazil, the United Kingdom,
Japan, Russia and Turkey. These fluctuations have significantly impacted our
historical net sales, net earnings and cash flows and could do so in the
future. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could
also have a negative impact on the consumption of our products, which would
negatively affect our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings
and cash flows.

Government Policies. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net
earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign
government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies. For example, our
net earnings and cash flows could be affected by any future legislative or
regulatory changes in U.S. or non-U.S. tax policy, including changes resulting
from the current work being led by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework focused on
"Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy." The breadth
of the OECD project extends beyond pure digital businesses and, as proposed,
is likely to impact most large multinational businesses by both redefining
jurisdictional taxation rights and establishing a 15% global minimum tax. Our
net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows may
also be impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign government policies related to
environmental and climate change matters. Additionally, we attempt to
carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries
with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as
Egypt, Argentina and Pakistan. Further, our net sales, gross margin, operating
margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to
international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere. Changes in
government policies in the above areas might cause an increase or decrease in
our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.

Russia-Ukraine War. The war between Russia and Ukraine has negatively impacted
our operations. Our Ukraine business includes two manufacturing sites and
accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales and consolidated net
earnings in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. Net assets of our Ukraine
business accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net assets as of June 30,
2023. Our Russia business includes two manufacturing sites. Beginning in March
2022, the Company reduced its product portfolio, discontinued new capital
investments and suspended media, advertising and promotional activity in
Russia. The Russia business accounted for approximately 2% of consolidated net
sales and consolidated net earnings in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.
Net assets of our Russia business accounted for less than 2% of consolidated
net assets as of June 30, 2023.

Future impacts to the Company are difficult to predict due to the high level
of uncertainty related to the war's duration, evolution and ultimate
resolution. Within Ukraine, there is a possibility of physical damage and
destruction of our two manufacturing facilities. We may not be able to operate
our manufacturing sites and source raw materials from our suppliers or ship
finished products to our customers.

Within Russia, we may not be able to continue our reduced operations at
current levels due to sanctions and counter-sanctions, monetary, currency or
payment controls, legislative restrictions or policies, restrictions on access
to financial institutions and supply and transportation challenges. Our
suppliers, distributors and retail customers are also impacted by the war and
their ability to successfully maintain their operations could also impact our
operations or negatively impact the sales of our products.

More broadly, there could be additional negative impacts to our net sales,
earnings and cash flows should the situation escalate beyond its current
scope, including, among other potential impacts, economic recessions in
certain neighboring countries or globally due to inflationary pressures and
supply chain cost increases or the geographic proximity of the war relative to
the rest of Europe.

For additional information on risk factors that could impact our business
results, please refer to "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The key metrics included in the discussion of our consolidated results of
operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and
administrative costs (SG&A), operating margin, other non-operating items,
income taxes and net earnings. The primary factors driving year-over-year
changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which
we compete, product initiatives, competitive activities (the level of
initiatives, pricing and other activities by competitors), marketing spending,
retail executions (both in-store and online) and acquisition and divestiture
activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as
our pricing actions (which can also impact volume), changes in product and
geographic mix and foreign exchange impacts on sales outside the U.S.

For most of our categories, our cost of products sold and SG&A are variable in
nature to some extent. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs
focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year
changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are
input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix
(for example, gross margins in North America are generally higher than the
Company average for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty
segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign

exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be
tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the
impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments (for example,
product or package improvements) and, to a lesser extent, scale impacts (for
costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary components of
SG&A are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs.
Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we may
achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other
marketing efficiencies. While overhead costs are variable to some extent, we
generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs due to our
ability to leverage our organization and systems' infrastructures to support
business growth. The main drivers of changes in SG&A as a percentage of net
sales are overhead and marketing cost savings, reinvestments (for example,
increased advertising), inflation, foreign exchange fluctuations and scale
impacts.

For a detailed discussion of the fiscal 2022 year-over-year changes, please
refer to the MD&A in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's [Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended June 30,
2022](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/80424/000008042422000064/0000080424-22-000064-index.htm).

Net Sales

Net sales increased 2% to $82.0 billion in fiscal 2023. The increase in net
sales was driven by higher pricing of 9% and a favorable mix of 1%, partially
offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 5% and a 3% decrease in unit volume
versus the prior year. Favorable mix was driven by a higher proportion of
sales in North America (with higher than Company-average selling prices) and
decline in Europe (with lower than Company-average selling prices). Excluding
the impacts of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, organic
sales grew 7%.

Net sales increased mid-single digits in Health Care, increased low single
digits in Fabric & Home Care, Baby, Feminine & Family Care and Beauty and
decreased low single digits in Grooming. On a regional basis, volume decreased
double digits in Europe, mid-single digits in Greater China and low single
digits in Asia Pacific, IMEA and North America. Volume increased low single
digits in Latin America.

Gross margin increased 50 basis points to 47.9% of net sales. The increase in
gross margin was due to:

•a 430 basis-point increase from higher pricing and

•a 150 basis-point increase from manufacturing productivity savings.

These increases were partially offset by

•320 basis points of increased commodity and input material costs,

•a 110 basis-point decline from unfavorable mix due to the launch and growth
of premium products (which have lower than Company-average gross margins) and
the disproportionate decline of the super-premium SK-II brand,

•a 50 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts,

•30 basis points due to capacity start-up costs and other manufacturing
impacts and

•20 basis points of product and packaging investments.

Total SG&A increased 4% to $21.1 billion due primarily to an increase in
overhead costs and other net operating costs. SG&A as a percentage of net
sales increased 50 basis points to 25.7% due to an increase in overhead and
other net operating costs as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a
decrease in marketing spending as a percentage of net sales.

•Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 40 basis points due
to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and increased
productivity savings, partially offset by increased media reinvestments.

•Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased 40 basis points due to
wage inflation and other cost increases, partially offset by the positive
scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings.

•Other net operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 60 basis
points due primarily to higher foreign exchange transactional charges.

Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 90 basis points of benefit to SG&A
as a percentage of net sales.

Operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 22.1% as the increase in gross
margin was more than fully offset by the increase in SG&A as a percentage of
net sales as discussed above.

Non-Operating Items

•Interest expense was $756 million, an increase of $317 million versus the
prior year due to higher interest rates and an increase in short-term debt in
the current year.

•Interest income was $307 million, an increase of $256 million versus the
prior year due to higher interest rates.

•Other non-operating income increased $98 million to $668 million due
primarily to a prior year unrealized loss on equity investments and a current
year gain on divestiture of minor brands.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate increased 190 basis points versus the prior year period
to 19.7% due to:

•a 100 basis-point increase from lower excess tax benefits of share-based
compensation,

•a 50 basis-point increase from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax
positions and

•a 40 basis-point increase primarily from lower current year deductions for
foreign-derived intangible income versus prior year.

Net Earnings

Operating income increased $321 million, or 2%, to $18.1 billion due to the
increase in net sales, partially offset by a modest decrease in operating
margin, both of which are discussed above.

Earnings before income taxes increased $358 million, or 2%, to $18.4 billion
due primarily to the increase in operating income. Net earnings declined
modestly by $55 million to $14.7 billion due to the increase in earnings
before income taxes, more than fully offset by the increase in the effective
income tax rate discussed above. Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings
by approximately $1.4 billion due to a weakening of certain currencies against
the U.S. dollar. This impact includes both transactional charges and
translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to
U.S. dollars.

Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble decreased $89 million, or 1%, to
$14.7 billion.

Diluted EPS increased $0.09, or 2%, to $5.90 as the decrease in net earnings
was more than fully offset by a reduction in shares outstanding.

SEGMENT RESULTS

Segment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal
management reporting and performance evaluation. The results of these
reportable segments do not include certain non-business unit specific costs
which are reported in our Corporate segment and are included as part of our
Corporate segment discussion. Additionally, we apply blended statutory tax
rates in the segments. Eliminations to adjust segment results to arrive at our
consolidated effective tax rate are included in Corporate. See Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on items included
in the Corporate segment.

higher pricing of 8% and benefit from acquisitions of 1% were partially offset
by unfavorable foreign exchange of 5%, unfavorable mix of 1% (due primarily to
the decline of the super-premium SK-II brand, which has higher than segment-
average selling prices) and a 1% decrease in unit volume.

The Procter & Gamble Company 21

Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange,
organic sales increased 6%. Global market share of the Beauty segment
increased 0.3 points.

•Hair Care net sales increased low single digits. Positive impacts of higher
pricing (driven by all regions) and benefit from acquisitions were partially
offset by the negative impacts of unfavorable foreign exchange and a decrease
in unit volume. Mix had a neutral impact on net sales. The volume decrease was
driven primarily by declines in Europe (due to portfolio reduction in Russia
and increased pricing), Greater China (due to market contraction and pandemic-
related disruptions) and Asia Pacific (due to increased pricing). Organic
sales increased high single digits driven by 20% growth in Latin America and
double-digit growth in Europe and North America, partially offset by a mid-
single-digit decline in Greater China. Global market share of the hair care
category decreased more than half a point.

•Skin and Personal Care net sales increased low single digits. Positive
impacts of higher pricing (across all regions), a unit volume increase and a
benefit from acquisitions were partially offset by the negative impacts from
unfavorable mix (due primarily to the decline of the super-premium SK-II
brand) and unfavorable foreign exchange. The volume increase was driven
primarily by growth in North America, Latin America and Greater China (all due
to innovation), partially offset by a decline in Asia Pacific (due to the
decline of the super-premium SK-II brand in the travel retail channel).
Organic sales increased mid-single digits as more than 20% increases in Latin
America and Europe and a double-digit increase in North America were partially
offset by a double-digit decrease in Asia Pacific. Global market share of the
skin and personal care category increased nearly a point.

Net earnings increased 1% to $3.2 billion due to the increase in net sales,
partially offset by a 20 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. Net
earnings margin decreased due to a reduction in gross margin, partially offset
by a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin
reduction was driven by negative product mix (due to the decline of the super-
premium SK-II brand), increased commodity costs and unfavorable foreign
exchange, partially offset by increased pricing. SG&A as a percentage of net
sales decreased primarily due to a decrease in marketing spending.

GROOMING

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

% of net sales| 22.8%| | 22.6%| | 20 bps  
  
Grooming net sales decreased 3% to $6.4 billion driven by unfavorable foreign
exchange of 7%, a 3% decrease in unit volume and unfavorable mix of 2% (due to
decline of appliances, which have higher than segment-average selling prices),
partially offset by higher pricing of 9% (driven by all regions). The volume
decrease was primarily driven by decreases in Europe (due to portfolio
reduction in Russia and increased pricing) and North America (due to market
contraction and increased pricing). Excluding the impact of acquisitions and
divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 5% driven by growth
in all regions led by a more than 20% growth in Latin America and a double-
digit growth in Asia Pacific. Global market share of the Grooming segment
increased 1 point.

Net earnings decreased 2% to $1.5 billion due to the decrease in net sales,
partially offset by a 20 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net
earnings margin increased as a decrease in gross margin was more than fully
offset by a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin
decrease was driven by unfavorable product mix (due to a disproportionate
decline of higher gross margin appliances such as premium shavers), commodity
cost increases and unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by higher
pricing and productivity savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased
due primarily to a decrease in marketing spending.

Health Care net sales increased 4% to $11.2 billion driven by higher pricing
of 5% and favorable mix of 4% (due to growth in North America and the Personal
Health Care category, both of which have higher than segment-average selling
prices), partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 4% and a 1%
decrease in unit volume. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and
acquisitions and divestitures, organic sales increased 8%. Global market share
of the Health Care segment decreased 0.2 points.

22 The Procter & Gamble Company

•Oral Care net sales decreased low single digits. Negative impacts of
unfavorable foreign exchange and a unit volume decrease were partially offset
by increased pricing (driven primarily by North America and Europe) and
favorable premium product mix. Volume decline was primarily driven by Europe
(due to portfolio reduction in Russia and increased pricing), North America
(due to increased pricing) and Greater China (due to market contraction,
especially in the power brush market). Organic sales increased low single
digits driven by a more than 20% growth in Latin America and a low single-
digit growth in North America. Global market share of the oral care category
was unchanged.

•Personal Health Care net sales increased double digits. Positive impacts of
favorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of North America and
respiratory products, both of which have higher than category-average selling
prices), higher pricing (driven primarily by North America, Europe and Latin
America) and a unit volume increase were partially offset by unfavorable
foreign exchange. Volume increase was primarily driven by growth in North
America (due to innovation and a stronger respiratory season) and Latin
America, partially offset by a decline in IMEA (versus a prior year impacted
by pandemic-related consumption increases in certain markets). Organic sales
increased mid-teens driven by a high teens increase in North America, a mid-
teens increase in Europe and a low teens increase in Latin America. Global
market share of the personal health care category was unchanged.

Net earnings increased 6% to $2.1 billion due to the increase in net sales and
a 40 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin
increased as a decrease in gross margin was more than fully offset by a
decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The decrease in gross margin
was driven by unfavorable product mix (due to the growth of products such as
manual brushes, which have lower gross margins) and increased commodity and
input material costs, partially offset by increased pricing. SG&A as a
percentage of net sales decreased due to the positive scale impacts of the net
sales increase and lower marketing spending, partially offset by increased
overhead spending.

Fabric & Home Care net sales increased 3% to $28.4 billion driven by higher
pricing of 11% and favorable mix of 1% (due to a disproportionate volume
decline in Europe, which has lower than segment-average selling prices),
partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 5% and a 4% decrease in
unit volume. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and acquisitions and
divestitures, organic sales increased 8%. Global market share of the Fabric &
Home Care segment was unchanged.

•Fabric Care net sales increased low single digits. Positive impacts of higher
pricing (driven by all regions) and favorable geographic mix (due to decline
in Europe, which has lower than category-average selling prices) were
partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and a decrease in unit
volume. The volume decrease was primarily driven by declines in Europe (due to
increased pricing and portfolio reduction in Russia), North America (due to
increased pricing and market contraction) and Greater China (due to portfolio
reductions and market contraction). Organic sales increased high single digits
driven by more than 20% increases in Latin America and IMEA, high single-digit
increases in Asia Pacific and Europe and a low single-digit increase in North
America. Global market share of the fabric care category decreased nearly a
point.

•Home Care net sales increased mid-single digits. Positive impacts of higher
pricing (driven primarily by Europe and North America) and favorable product
mix were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and a decrease in
unit volume. The volume decrease was driven by declines in Europe (due to
market contraction and increased pricing) and North America (due to market
contraction). Organic sales increased high single digits driven by a mid-teens
growth in Europe and a high single-digit growth in North America. Global
market share of the home care category increased more than a point.

Net earnings increased 10% to $4.8 billion due to the increase in net sales
and a 110 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin
increased due to an increase in gross margin, partially offset by an increase
in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin increase was driven by
increased pricing, partially offset by an increase in commodity and input
material costs, unfavorable foreign exchange and unfavorable product mix. SG&A
as a percentage of net sales increased due to an increase in media spending,
partially offset by the positive scale effects of the net sales increase.

Baby, Feminine & Family Care net sales increased 2% to $20.2 billion as the
positive impacts of higher pricing of 8% and favorable mix of 1% (due to a
higher proportion of sales in North America, which has higher than segment-
average selling prices) were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange
of 4% and a 3% decrease in unit volume. Excluding the impact of foreign
exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, organic sales increased 6%. Global
market share of the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment was unchanged.

•Baby Care net sales decreased low single digits. Negative impacts of a
decrease in unit volume and unfavorable foreign exchange were partially offset
by higher pricing (across all regions) and favorable product and geographic
mix (due to a higher proportion of sales in North America). The volume
decrease was driven primarily by declines in Europe (due to increased pricing
and portfolio reduction in Russia), North America (due to increased pricing)
and Greater China. Organic sales increased mid-single digits driven by a more
than 30% growth in Latin America, high single-digit growth in IMEA and mid-
single-digit growth in North America and Europe, partially offset by a double-
digit decline in Greater China. Global market share of the baby care category
was unchanged.

•Feminine Care net sales increased mid-single digits. Positive impacts of
higher pricing (driven by all regions) and favorable product and geographic
mix (due to a decline in Europe, which has lower than category-average selling
prices) were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and a decrease
in unit volume. The volume decrease was driven primarily by declines in Europe
(due to portfolio reduction in Russia and increased pricing) and IMEA (due to
increased pricing). Organic sales increased double digits driven by growth in
all regions led by a mid-teens increase in Europe and a double-digit increase
in North America. Market share of the feminine care category increased nearly
half a point.

•Net sales in Family Care, which is predominantly a North American business,
increased low single digits driven by higher pricing. Unit volume had a
neutral impact on net sales. Organic sales increased mid-single digits. North
America's share of the family care category decreased nearly half a point.

Net earnings increased 9% to $3.5 billion due to the increase in net sales and
a 100 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin
increased primarily due to an increase in gross margin and a modest decrease
in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin increased due to increased
pricing, partially offset by an increase in commodity and input material
costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due to the positive scale
effects of the net sales increase partially offset by an increase in other
operating expense.

Net sales| $765| | $744| | 3%  
Net earnings/(loss)| $(399)| | $485| | N/A  
  
Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not
allocated to specific business segments. These include but are not limited to
incidental businesses managed at the corporate level, gains and losses related
to certain divested brands or businesses, impacts from various financing and
investing activities, impacts related to employee benefits, asset impairments
and restructuring activities including manufacturing and workforce
optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the
accounting policies used within the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP. The most
notable ongoing reconciling item is income taxes, which adjusts the blended
statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall
Company effective tax rate.

Corporate net sales increased 3% to $765 million due to an increase in net
sales of the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate
net earnings decreased $884 million to a loss of $399 million primarily due to
higher interest expense, lower excess tax benefits of share-based compensation
and higher foreign exchange transactional charges, partially offset by the
increase in net sales of the incidental businesses and higher interest income.

Restructuring Program to Deliver Productivity and Cost Savings

The Company has historically had an ongoing restructuring program with annual
spending in the range of $250 to $500 million. Savings generated from the
Company's restructuring program are difficult to estimate, given the nature of
the activities, the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. In
fiscal 2023, the Company incurred before tax restructuring costs within the
range of our historical annual ongoing level of $250 to $500 million.

  

* * *

24 The Procter & Gamble Company

Restructuring accruals of $174 million as of June 30, 2023, are classified as
current liabilities. Approximately 87% of the restructuring charges incurred
in fiscal 2023 either have been or will be settled with cash. Consistent with
our policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges
are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting.

In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings
efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield
additional benefits to our operating margins.

CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

We believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as
evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to
readily access capital markets at competitive rates.

Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating
needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund
shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and
acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and
geographies. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to
fund these activities. The overall cash position of the Company reflects our
strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into
account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.

Operating Cash Flow

Operating cash flow was $16.8 billion in 2023, a 1% increase versus the prior
year. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and
amortization, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes and gain on sale
of assets) generated approximately $17.5 billion of operating cash flow.
Working capital and other impacts used $656 million of operating cash flow as
summarized below.

•An increase in Accounts receivable used $307 million of cash primarily due to
sales growth. The number of days sales outstanding increased approximately 1
day versus prior year.

•Higher inventory used $119 million of cash due to increased safety stock
levels to strengthen supply chain sufficiency. Inventory days on hand was flat
versus year ago.

•Accounts payable and Accrued and other liabilities provided $313 million of
cash, primarily driven by increases in taxes payable and accrued compensation
expense, partially offset by a reduction in trade payables. The reduction in
trade payables was due to lower supply chain payables from a decrease in
commodity and transportation costs, partially offset by the impact of extended
payment terms with suppliers (see Extended Payment Terms and Supply Chain
Financing below). Days payable outstanding decreased approximately 3 days
versus prior year.

•Other net operating assets and liabilities used $543 million of cash
primarily driven by pension-related contributions.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important non-
GAAP measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for
dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary
investments. It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures
and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax
Act. Adjusted free cash flow is one of the measures used to evaluate senior
management and determine their at-risk compensation.

Adjusted free cash flow was $14.0 billion in 2023, an increase of 2% versus
the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in operating
cash flows as discussed above. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined
as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings, was 95% in 2023.

Extended Payment Terms and Supply Chain Financing. Beginning in fiscal 2014,
in response to evolving market practices, the Company began a program to
negotiate extended payment terms with its suppliers. At the same time, the
Company initiated a Supply Chain Finance program (the "SCF") with a number of
global financial institutions (the "SCF Banks"). Under the SCF, qualifying
suppliers may elect to sell their receivables from the Company to an SCF Bank.
These participating suppliers negotiate their receivables sales arrangements
directly with the respective SCF Bank. While the Company is not party to those
agreements, the SCF Banks allow the participating suppliers to utilize the
Company's creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated
costs. This generally provides the suppliers with more favorable terms than
they would be able to secure on their own. The Company has no economic
interest in a supplier's decision to sell a receivable. Once a qualifying
supplier elects to participate in the SCF and reaches an agreement with an SCF
Bank, they elect which individual Company invoices they sell to the SCF bank.
However, all the Company's payments to participating suppliers are paid to the
SCF Bank on the invoice due date, regardless of whether the individual invoice
is sold by the supplier to the SCF Bank. The SCF Bank pays the supplier on the
invoice due date for any invoices that were not previously sold to the SCF
Bank under the SCF.

The Procter & Gamble Company 25

The terms of the Company's payment obligation are not impacted by a supplier's
participation in the SCF. Our payment terms with our suppliers for similar
services and materials within individual markets are consistent between
suppliers that elect to participate in the SCF and those that do not
participate. Accordingly, our average days outstanding are not significantly
impacted by the portion of suppliers or related input costs that are included
in the SCF. In addition, the SCF is available to both material suppliers,
where the underlying costs are largely included in Cost of goods sold, and to
service suppliers, where the underlying costs are largely included in SG&A. As
of June 30, 2023, approximately 3% of our global suppliers have elected to
participate in the SCF. Payments to those suppliers during fiscal year 2023
were approximately $18 billion, which equals approximately 29% of our total
Cost of goods sold and SG&A for the year. For participating suppliers, we
believe substantially all of their receivables with the Company are sold to
the SCF Banks. Accordingly, we would expect that at each balance sheet date, a
similar proportion of amounts originally due to suppliers would instead be
payable to SCF Banks. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers
participating in the SCF are recorded within Accounts payable in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the associated payments are included in
operating activities within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of
June 30, 2023 and 2022, the amounts due to suppliers participating in the SCF
and included in Accounts payable were approximately $6 billion.

Although difficult to project due to market and other dynamics, we anticipate
incremental cash flow benefits from the extended payment terms with suppliers
could increase at a slower rate in fiscal 2024. Future changes in our
suppliers' financing policies or economic developments, such as changes in
interest rates, general market liquidity or the Company's credit-worthiness
relative to participating suppliers, could impact suppliers' participation in
the SCF and/or our ability to negotiate extended payment terms with our
suppliers. However, any such impacts are difficult to predict.

Investing Cash Flow

Net investing activities used $3.5 billion of cash in 2023, primarily due to
capital spending and acquisitions.

Capital Spending. Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity
expansion, innovation and cost efficiencies, were $3.1 billion in 2023.
Capital spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points to
3.7% in 2023.

Acquisitions. Acquisition activity used cash of $765 million in 2023,
primarily related to a Beauty acquisition.

Financing Cash Flow

Net financing activities consumed $12.1 billion of cash in 2023, mainly due to
dividends to shareholders and treasury stock purchases, partially offset by a
net debt increase and the impact of stock options and other.

Dividend Payments. Our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments.
Dividends per common share increased 4% to $3.6806 per share in 2023. Total
dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were $9.0 billion in
2023. In April 2023, the Board of Directors declared a 3% increase in our
quarterly dividend from $0.9133 to $0.9407 per share on Common Stock and
Series A and B Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) Convertible Class A
Preferred Stock. This is the 67th consecutive year that our dividend has
increased. We have paid a dividend for 133 consecutive years, every year since
our incorporation in 1890.

Long-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate
after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash
requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including
acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and the overall cost of capital.
Total debt was $34.6 billion as of June 30, 2023. We generated $2.9 billion
from net debt issuances in short-term debt and long-term debt markets.

Treasury Purchases. Total share repurchases were $7.4 billion in 2023.

Impact of Stock Options and Other. The exercise of stock options and other
financing activities generated $1.3 billion of cash in 2023.

Liquidity

At June 30, 2023, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $13.1
billion, largely due to short-term borrowings under our commercial paper
program. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and
operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. The Company
regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these
needs. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had $5.1 billion of cash and cash
equivalents related to foreign subsidiaries, primarily in various European and
Asian countries. We did not have material cash and cash equivalents related to
any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our
ability to access or repatriate the funds. Under current law, we do not expect
restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have
a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results
of operations for the foreseeable future.

We utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as
acquisitions and share repurchases. We have strong short- and long-term debt
ratings, which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our
debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond
markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial
institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient funding to meet short-
term financing requirements.

On June 30, 2023, our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+
(Standard & Poor's), while our long-term credit ratings were Aa3 (Moody's) and
AA- (Standard & Poor's), all with a stable outlook.

We maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper
program. The current facility is an $8.0 billion facility split between a $3.2
billion five-year facility and a $4.8 billion 364-day facility, which expire
in November 2027 and

  

* * *

26 The Procter & Gamble Company

November 2023, respectively. Both facilities can be extended for certain
periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement. These
facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain
undrawn. These credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings
triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time
of signing. In addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically
effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is
available for registered offerings of short- or long-term debt securities. For
additional details on debt, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements,
including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material
impact on our financial condition or liquidity.

(1)Represents the U.S. federal tax liability associated with the repatriation
provisions of the U.S. Tax Act.

(2)Represents future pension payments to comply with local funding
requirements. These future pension payments assume the Company continues to
meet its future statutory funding requirements. Considering the current
economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its
cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements. The
projected payments beyond fiscal year 2026 are not currently determinable.

(3)Primarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay
arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business.
Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represent minimum commitments
with suppliers and are in line with expected usage. This includes service
contracts for information technology, human resources management and
facilities management activities that have been outsourced. While the amounts
listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that
the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were
canceled prior to maturity. In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate
new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The
amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not
take-or-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily
purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are
reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such
purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

In preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are
certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable
accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their
application. These include revenue recognition, income taxes, certain employee
benefits and goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting
policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the
results of operations and financial condition of the Company.

The Company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and
the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of
Directors.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to
customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation
and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and
rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt
by the customer. Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing
allowances, in-store merchandising funds, advertising and other promotional
activities and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to
customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending,
which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale. Amounts accrued for
trade promotions at the end of a period require estimation, based on
contractual terms, sales volumes and historical utilization and redemption
rates. The actual amounts paid may be different from such estimates. These
differences, which have historically not been significant, are recognized as a
change in management estimate in a subsequent period.

Income Taxes

Our annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and
the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for
financial reporting purposes. Also inherent in determining our annual tax rate
are judgements and

  

* * *

The Procter & Gamble Company 27

assumptions regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balances,
primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, and our ability to
uphold certain tax positions.

Realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon
generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to
the expiration of the carryforward periods, which involves business plans,
planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Although
realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not
that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.

We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory
environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions
that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to
successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These
interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing
authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment.

A core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business
operating model, such that profits are earned in line with the business
substance and functions of the various legal entities in the jurisdictions
where those functions are performed. However, because of the complexity of
transfer pricing concepts, we may have income tax uncertainty related to the
determination of intercompany transfer prices for our various cross-border
transactions. We have obtained and continue to prioritize the strategy of
seeking advance rulings with tax authorities to reduce this uncertainty. We
estimate that our current portfolio of advance rulings reduces this
uncertainty with respect to over 70% of our global earnings. We evaluate our
tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable
accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax
uncertainties considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the
progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have several audits in
process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax
positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe
that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Because there are several estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating
the various components of our tax provision, certain future events such as
changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax
audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates
and our effective tax rate. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional details on the Company's income taxes.

Employee Benefits

We sponsor various postretirement benefits throughout the world. These include
pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and
other postretirement benefit (OPRB) plans consisting primarily of health care
and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit
pension and OPRB plans require assumptions to estimate the net projected and
accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount
rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as
turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health
care cost trend rates. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense
and net obligations recognized for the underlying plans. Our assumptions
reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding
future expectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual
results differ from our assumptions is deferred. If this net deferred amount
exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the
deferred amount is included in expense for the following year. The cost or
benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior
employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on
a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the
employees expected to receive benefits.

The expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit
expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPRB
plan are partially funded. The process for setting the expected rates of
return is described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For
2023, the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and
OPRB assets was 5.9% and 8.4%, respectively. A change in the rate of return of
100 basis points for both pension and OPRB assets would impact annual after-
tax benefit/expense by approximately $135 million.

Since pension and OPRB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the
discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. Discount rates used
for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPRB plans are based on a yield curve
constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and
amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan. For our
international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against
investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The average discount rate
on the defined benefit pension plans of 4.2% represents a weighted average of
local rates in countries where such plans exist. A 100 basis-point change in
the discount rate would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by
approximately $130 million. The average discount rate on the OPRB plan of 5.6%
reflects the higher interest rates generally applicable in the U.S., which is
where most of the plan participants receive benefits. A 100 basis-point change
in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax OPRB expense by
approximately $30 million. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional details on our defined benefit pension and OPRB plans.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill
reporting units and intangible assets. Accordingly, we typically obtain the
assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant goodwill
reporting units and intangible assets. Determining the useful life of an
intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangible assets are
expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to
continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible
assets (e.g., certain brands, customer relationships, patents and
technologies) are expected to have determinable

  

* * *

28 The Procter & Gamble Company

useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and
those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including
competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life
cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in
which the brands are sold. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized
to expense over their estimated lives. An impairment assessment for
determinable-lived intangibles is only required when an event or change in
circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be
recoverable.

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are
tested at least annually for impairment. We use the income method to estimate
the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected
future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. If the resulting fair
value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an
impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31.

Most of our goodwill reporting units have fair value cushions that
significantly exceed their underlying carrying values. In connection with the
Grooming operating segment integration as described further in Note 2, we
concluded that the Shave Care and Appliances categories now operate as one
reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing. Based on our annual impairment
testing during the three months ended December 31, 2022, our Grooming
reporting unit goodwill has a fair value cushion of over 30%. As of June 30,
2023, the carrying value of the Grooming reporting unit goodwill was $12.7
billion.

Most of our indefinite-lived intangible assets have fair value cushions that
significantly exceed their underlying carrying value. Based on our annual
impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2022, the
Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value exceeded its carrying
value by approximately 5%. As of June 30, 2023, the carrying value of the
Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was $14.1 billion. While we have
concluded that no triggering event has occurred during the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2023, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is most
susceptible to future impairment risk. Adverse changes in the business or in
the macroeconomic environment, including foreign currency devaluation,
increasing global inflation, market contraction from an economic recession and
the Russia-Ukraine War, could reduce the underlying cash flows used to
estimate the fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset and
trigger a future impairment charge. Further reduction of the Gillette business
activities in Russia could reduce the estimated fair value by up to 5%.

The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the
estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the
net sales growth rates (including residual growth rates), discount rate and
royalty rates.

Net sales growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes
in demand for our Gillette products, which may be caused by, among other
things: changes in the use and frequency of grooming products, shifts in
demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced
products or potential supply chain constraints. In addition, relative global
and country/regional macroeconomic factors, including the Russia-Ukraine War,
could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries'
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The residual growth rates represent
the expected rate at which the Gillette brand is expected to grow beyond the
shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rates utilized in
our fair value estimates are consistent with the brand operating plans and
approximates expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual
growth rates depend on overall market growth rates, the competitive
environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business
activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rates
could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth,
grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or
an increased competitive environment.

The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital
that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry
required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity
components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by
adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and
debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of
currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value
measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows
outside the U.S.

The royalty rates are driven by historical and estimated future profitability
of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by
significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins.

We performed a sensitivity analysis for the Gillette indefinite-lived
intangible asset as part of our annual impairment testing during the three
months ended December 31, 2022, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the
assumptions for the discount rate, the short-term and residual growth rates
and the royalty rates to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated
fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value
impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis-
point decrease in our shorter-term and residual growth rates, or a 50 basis-
point decrease in our royalty rates, which may result in an impairment of the
Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.

OTHER INFORMATION

Hedging and Derivative Financial Instruments

As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to
market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and
commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take
advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. We leverage the
Company's diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize
operational hedging activities over financial market instruments. To the
extent we choose to further manage volatility within our financing operations,
as discussed below, we enter into various financial transactions which we
account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative
instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed
by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types
and other hedging practices. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative
instruments.

Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market
valuation, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling. The tests for
interest rate, currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed
below are based on the RiskManager™ value-at-risk model using a one-year
horizon and a 95% confidence level. The model incorporates the impact of
correlation (the degree to which exposures move together over time) and
diversification (from holding multiple currency, commodity and interest rate
instruments) and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed.
Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the
RiskMetrics™ dataset as of June 30, 2023. In cases where data is unavailable
in RiskMetrics™, a reasonable proxy is included.

Our market risk exposures relative to interest rates, currency rates and
commodity prices, as discussed below, have not changed materially versus the
previous reporting period. In addition, we are not aware of any facts or
circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term.

Interest Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Interest rate swaps are used
to manage exposures to interest rates on underlying debt obligations. Certain
interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge
exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign
operations. These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the
Company's foreign net investments.

Based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2023, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to
interest rates, we believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95%
confidence level based on historical interest rate movements, would not
materially affect our financial statements.

Currency Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Because we manufacture and
sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the
world, we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in
currency exchange rates. Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable
hedging activity. To manage the exchange rate risk associated with the
financing of our operations, we primarily use forward contracts and currency
swaps with maturities of less than 18 months.

Based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of
and during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, we believe, at a 95%
confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact on
such instruments of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially
affect our financial statements.

Commodity Price Exposure on Financial Instruments. We use raw materials that
are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions,
political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. We may use
futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the
above exposures. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we did
not have any financial commodity hedging activity.

Measures Not Defined By U.S. GAAP

In accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides
definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most
closely related GAAP measure. We believe that these measures provide useful
perspective on underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding non-
recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of
year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by
management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and
for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors, as
they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide
investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These
measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in
determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not
intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measures
but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP
measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due
to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted.
These measures include:

Organic Sales Growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales
growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign
exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides
investors with a

supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales
growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing the
achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash
flow less capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax
resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash
that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned
maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an

Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is
defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings. We view
adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors
understand P&G's ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow
productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in
allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure
is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk
compensation.

Core EPS. Core EPS is a measure of the Company's diluted EPS excluding items
that are not judged by management to be part of the Company's sustainable
results or trends. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful
supplemental measure of Company performance over time. This measure is also
used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk
compensation. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, there were no
adjustments to or reconciling items for diluted EPS.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting of The Procter & Gamble Company (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.

Strong internal controls is an objective that is reinforced through our
Worldwide Business Conduct Manual, which sets forth our commitment to conduct
business with integrity, and within both the letter and the spirit of the law.
Our people are deeply committed to our Purpose, Values and Principles, which
unite us in doing what's right. Our system of internal controls includes
written policies and procedures, segregation of duties and the careful
selection and development of employees. Additional key elements of our
internal control structure include our Global Leadership Council, which is
actively involved in oversight of the business strategies, initiatives,
results and controls, our Disclosure Committee, which is responsible for
evaluating disclosure implications of significant business activities and
events, our Board of Directors, which provides strong and effective corporate
governance, and our Audit Committee, which reviews critical accounting
policies and estimates, financial reporting and internal control matters.

Global Internal Audit performs audits of internal controls over financial
reporting as well as broader financial, operational and compliance audits
around the world, provides training and continually improves our internal
control processes. The Company's internal control over financial reporting
also includes a robust Control Self-Assessment Program that is conducted
annually on critical financial reporting areas of the Company. Management
takes the appropriate action to correct any identified control deficiencies.

Because of its inherent limitations, any system of internal control over
financial reporting, no matter how well designed, may not prevent or detect
misstatements due to the possibility that a control can be circumvented or
overridden or that misstatements due to error or fraud may occur that are not
detected. Also, because of changes in conditions, internal control
effectiveness may vary over time.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over
financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, using criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and concluded that
the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as
of June 30, 2023, based on these criteria.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has
audited the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting as of June 30, 2023, as stated in their report which is included
herein.

32 The Procter & Gamble Company

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Procter & Gamble Company

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Procter &
Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30, 2023 and 2022,
the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income,
Shareholders' Equity and Cash Flows, for each of the three years in the period
ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
"financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2023, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on criteria
established in Internal Control -- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated August 4, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the
current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)
involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by
communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on
the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it
relates.

Intangible Assets -- Gillette Indefinite Lived Intangible Asset -- Refer to
Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company's evaluation of the Gillette indefinite lived intangible asset
(the "Gillette Brand") for impairment involves the comparison of the fair
value to its carrying value. The Company estimates fair value using the income
method, which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows
attributable to the respective asset. This requires management to make
significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future net sales
and earnings, including growth rates beyond a 10-year time period, royalty
rates, and discount rate. Changes in the assumptions could have a significant
impact on either the fair value, the amount of any impairment charge, or both.
The Company performed their annual impairment assessment of the Gillette Brand
as of December 31, 2022. Because the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying
value, no impairment was recorded. As of June 30, 2023, the carrying value of
the Gillette Brand was $14.1 billion.

We identified the Company's impairment evaluation of the Gillette Brand as a
critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management
to estimate the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset. A high
degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort was required when
performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management's
estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of future net sales and
earnings as well as the selection of royalty rates and discount rate,
including the need to involve our fair value specialists.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to forecasts of future net sales and earnings and
the selection of the royalty rates and discount rate for the Gillette Brand
included the following, among others:

•We tested the effectiveness of controls over the Gillette Brand, including
those over the determination of fair value, such as controls related to
management's development of forecasts of future net sales and earnings, and
the selection of royalty rates and discount rate.

•We evaluated management's ability to accurately forecast net sales and
earnings by comparing actual results to management's historical forecasts.

  

* * *

The Procter & Gamble Company 33

•We evaluated the reasonableness of management's forecast of net sales and
earnings by comparing the forecasts to:

•Historical net sales and earnings.

•Underlying analysis detailing business strategies and growth plans.

•Internal communications to management and the Board of Directors.

•Forecasted information included in analyst and industry reports for the
Company and certain of its peer companies.

•With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the net sales
and earnings growth rates, royalty rates, and discount rate by:

•Testing the source information underlying the determination of net sales and
earnings growth rates, royalty rates, and discount rate and the mathematical
accuracy of the calculations.

•Developing a range of independent estimates for the discount rate and
comparing the discount rate selected by management to that range.

34 The Procter & Gamble Company

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Procter & Gamble Company

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Procter &
Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30, 2023, based on
criteria established in Internal Control -- Integrated Framework (2013) issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based
on criteria established in Internal Control -- Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial
statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023, of the Company and our
report dated August 4, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to
the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting
was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations

The Procter & Gamble Company's (the "Company," "Procter & Gamble," "we" or
"us") business is focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of
superior quality and value. Our products are sold in approximately 180
countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce
(including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores,
drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty
stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores,
pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct
to consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries.

Basis of Presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its controlled
subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions are eliminated.

Because of a lack of control over Venezuelan subsidiaries caused by a number
of currency and other operating controls and restrictions, our Venezuelan
subsidiaries are not consolidated for any year presented. We account for those
subsidiaries at cost, less impairments, plus or minus observable price
changes.

Beginning in fiscal year 2022, the Company began to present increases and
reductions in short-term debt with maturities of more than three months
separately within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The presentation
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, has been revised to align with the
current period presentation. This change had no impact on total financing
activities, and we have concluded the change is not material.

Use of Estimates

Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. These
estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and
actions the Company may undertake in the future. Estimates are used in
accounting for, among other items, consumer and trade promotion accruals,
restructuring reserves, pensions, postretirement benefits, stock options,
valuation of acquired intangible assets, useful lives for depreciation and
amortization of long-lived assets, future cash flows associated with
impairment testing for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other
long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain income tax
positions and contingencies. Actual results may ultimately differ from
estimates, although management does not generally believe such differences
would materially affect the financial statements in any individual year.
However, regarding ongoing impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets, significant deterioration in future cash flow projections
or other assumptions used in estimating fair values versus those anticipated
at the time of the initial valuations, could result in impairment charges that
materially affect the financial statements in a given year.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to
customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation
and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and
rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt
by the customer. A provision for payment discounts and product return
allowances is recorded as a reduction of sales in the same period the revenue
is recognized. The revenue recorded is presented net of sales and other taxes
we collect on behalf of governmental authorities. The revenue includes
shipping and handling costs, which generally are included in the list price to
the customer.

Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances,
merchandising funds and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs
to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion
spending, which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale. Most of
these arrangements have terms of approximately one year. Accruals for expected
payouts under these programs are included as accrued marketing and promotion
in the Accrued and other liabilities line item in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

Cost of Products Sold

Cost of products sold is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies
consumed in the manufacturing of product, as well as manufacturing labor,
depreciation expense and direct overhead expenses necessary to acquire and
convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished products. Cost of
products sold also includes the cost to distribute products to customers,
inbound freight costs, internal transfer costs, warehousing costs and other
shipping and handling activity.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense

Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) is primarily comprised of
marketing expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs,
administrative and other indirect overhead costs, depreciation and
amortization expense on non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous
operating items. Research and development costs are charged to expense as
incurred and were $2.0 billion in 2023 and 2022 and $1.9 billion in 2021.
Advertising costs, charged to expense as incurred, include television, print,
radio, digital and in-store advertising expenses and were $8.0 billion in
2023, $7.9 billion in 2022 and

Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise
specified.

* * *

40 The Procter & Gamble Company

$8.2 billion in 2021. Non-advertising related components of the Company's
total marketing spending reported in SG&A include costs associated with
consumer promotions, product sampling and sales aids.

Other Non-Operating Income, Net

Other non-operating income, net primarily includes divestiture gains, net non-
service impacts related to postretirement benefit plans, investment income and
other non-operating items.

Currency Translation

Financial statements of operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. generally are
measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Adjustments to
translate those statements into U.S. dollars are recorded in Other
comprehensive income (OCI). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary
economies, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. Re-measurement
adjustments for financial statements in highly inflationary economies and
other transactional exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings.

Cash Flow Presentation

The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are prepared using the indirect
method, which reconciles net earnings to cash flows from operating activities.
Cash flows from foreign currency transactions and operations are translated at
monthly exchange rates for each period. Cash flows from hedging activities are
included in the same category as the items being hedged. Cash flows from
derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified as
investing activities. Realized gains and losses from non-qualifying derivative
instruments used to hedge currency exposures resulting from intercompany
financing transactions are classified as financing activities. Cash flows from
other derivative instruments used to manage interest rates, commodity or other
currency exposures are classified as operating activities. Cash payments
related to income taxes are classified as operating activities.

Investments

The Company holds minor equity investments in certain companies over which we
exert significant influence, but do not control the financial and operating
decisions. These are accounted for as equity method investments. Other equity
investments that are not controlled, and over which we do not have the ability
to exercise significant influence, and for which there is a readily
determinable market value, are recorded at fair value, with gains and losses
recorded through net earnings. Equity investments without readily determinable
fair values are measured at cost, less impairments, plus or minus observable
price changes. Equity investments are included as Other noncurrent assets in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company also holds highly liquid investments, primarily money market funds
and time deposits. Such investments are considered cash equivalents and are
included within Cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Inventory Valuation

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Product-
related inventories are maintained on the first-in, first-out method. The cost
of spare part inventories is maintained using the average-cost method.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost reduced by accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation expense is recognized over the assets' estimated
useful lives using the straight-line method. Machinery and equipment includes
office furniture and fixtures (15-year life), computer equipment and
capitalized software (3\- to 5-year lives) and manufacturing equipment (3\- to
20-year lives). Buildings are depreciated over an estimated useful life of 40
years. Estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed and, when appropriate,
changes are made prospectively. When certain events or changes in operating
conditions occur, asset lives may be adjusted and an impairment assessment may
be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are
evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential
impairment are present. Our annual impairment testing of goodwill is performed
separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets.

We have acquired brands that have been determined to have indefinite lives. We
evaluate several factors to determine whether an indefinite life is
appropriate, including the competitive environment, market share, brand
history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic
environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. In addition, when
certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an additional
impairment assessment is performed and indefinite-lived assets may be adjusted
to a determinable life.

The cost of intangible assets with determinable useful lives is amortized to
reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, either on a straight-line
or accelerated basis over the estimated periods benefited. Patents, technology
and other intangible assets with contractual terms are generally amortized
over their respective legal or contractual lives. Customer relationships,
brands and other non-contractual intangible assets with determinable lives are
amortized over periods generally ranging from 5 to 30 years. When certain
events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment is
performed and remaining lives of intangible assets with determinable lives may
be adjusted.

For additional details on goodwill and intangible assets see Note 4.

  

Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise
specified.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

Certain financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value.
Changes in assumptions or estimation methods could affect the fair value
estimates; however, we do not believe any such changes would have a material
impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Other
financial instruments, including cash equivalents, certain investments and
certain short-term debt, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.
The fair values of long-term debt and financial instruments are disclosed in
Note 9.

New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies

In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-04, "Liabilities - Supplier Finance
Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program
Obligations". This guidance requires annual and interim disclosures for
entities that use supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase of
goods and services. These amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2022, except for the amendment on rollforward information,
which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. We will
adopt the guidance effective July 1, 2023. Additional disclosures will be
included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

No other new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the fiscal
year or in future years had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTE 2

SEGMENT INFORMATION

Under U.S. GAAP, our operating segments are aggregated into five reportable
segments: 1) Beauty, 2) Grooming, 3) Health Care, 4) Fabric & Home Care and 5)
Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Our five reportable segments are comprised of:

•Beauty: Hair Care (Conditioners, Shampoos, Styling Aids, Treatments); Skin
and Personal Care (Antiperspirants and Deodorants, Personal Cleansing, Skin
Care);

•Grooming: Grooming (Appliances, Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors,
Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Grooming);

•Health Care: Oral Care (Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care); Personal
Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Pain Relief, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory,
Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Other Personal Health Care);

•Fabric & Home Care: Fabric Care (Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry
Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care);
and

•Baby, Feminine & Family Care: Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Taped Diapers and
Pants); Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care); Family Care (Paper
Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper).

While none of our reportable segments are highly seasonal, components within
certain reportable segments, such as Appliances (Grooming) and Personal Health
Care (Health), are seasonal.

The accounting policies of the segments are generally the same as those
described in Note 1. Differences between these policies and U.S. GAAP
primarily reflect income taxes, which are reflected in the segments using
applicable blended statutory rates. Adjustments to arrive at our effective tax
rate are included in Corporate. In addition, capital expenditures in the
segments are on an accrual basis consistent with the balance sheet.
Adjustments to move from an accrual to cash basis, for purposes of the cash
flow statement, are reflected in Corporate.

Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities that are not
reflected in the operating results used internally to measure and evaluate the
businesses, as well as items to adjust management reporting principles to U.S.
GAAP. Operating activities in Corporate include the results of incidental
businesses managed at the corporate level. Operating elements also include
certain employee benefit costs, the costs of certain restructuring-type
activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing
and workforce optimization, asset impairment charges and other general
Corporate items. The non-operating elements in Corporate primarily include
interest expense, certain pension and other postretirement benefit costs,
certain acquisition and divestiture gains, interest and investing income and
other financing costs.

Total assets for the reportable segments include those assets managed by the
reportable segment, primarily inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets.
Other assets, primarily cash, accounts receivable, investment securities and
goodwill, are included in Corporate.

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM

The Company has historically incurred an ongoing annual level of
restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure,
including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Before tax costs incurred
under ongoing programs have generally ranged from $250 to $500 annually.

Restructuring costs incurred consist primarily of costs to separate employees,
asset-related costs to exit facilities and other costs. Employee separation
costs relate to severance packages that are primarily voluntary and the
amounts calculated are based on salary levels and past service periods.
Severance costs related to voluntary separations are generally charged to
earnings when the employee accepts the offer. Asset-related costs consist of
both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation. Asset write-downs relate
to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or for
disposal. These assets are written down to the lower of their current carrying
basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal
costs. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that
will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period.
These assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations and technology
standardizations. The asset-related charges will not have a significant impact
on future depreciation charges. Other restructuring-type charges primarily
include asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain and
overhead optimization. The Company incurred total restructuring charges of
$329 and $253 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. Of the
charges incurred for fiscal year 2023, $160 were recorded in Costs of products
sold, $160 in SG&A and $9 in Other non-operating income, net. Of the

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are tested for impairment at least
annually by comparing the estimated fair values of our reporting units and
indefinite-lived intangible assets to their respective carrying values. We use
the income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based
on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective
assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations
reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the
amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and
profitability). Significant judgement by management is required to estimate
the impact of macroeconomic and other factors on future cash flows, including
those related to the Russia-Ukraine War. Estimates utilized in the projected
cash flows include consideration of macroeconomic conditions, overall category
growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin expansion,
Company business plans, the underlying product or technology life cycles,
economic barriers to entry, a brand's relative market position and the
discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic
events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or
validity of the estimates and assumptions.

Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise
specified.

46 The Procter & Gamble Company

We believe the estimates and assumptions utilized in our impairment testing
are reasonable and are comparable to those that would be used by other
marketplace participants. However, actual events and results could differ
substantially from those used in our valuations. To the extent such factors
result in a failure to achieve the level of projected cash flows initially
used to estimate fair value for purposes of establishing or subsequently
impairing the carrying amount of goodwill and related intangible assets, we
may need to record additional non-cash impairment charges in the future.

Goodwill increased during fiscal 2023 primarily due to an acquisition in the
Beauty segment, other minor brand acquisitions in the Baby, Feminine & Family
Care segment and currency translation across all reportable segments.

Goodwill decreased during fiscal 2022 due to currency translation across all
reportable segments, partially offset by three acquisitions (Farmacy Beauty,
Ouai and TULA) in the Beauty reportable segment.

INCOME TAXES

Income taxes are recognized for the amount of taxes payable for the current
year and for the impact of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which
represent future tax consequences of events that have been recognized
differently in the financial statements than for tax purposes. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are established using the enacted statutory tax rates
and are adjusted for any changes in such rates in the period of change.

We have elected to account for the tax effects of Global Intangible Low-Taxed
Income (GILTI) as a current period expense when incurred.

Country mix impacts of foreign operations includes the effects of foreign
subsidiaries' earnings taxed at rates other than the U.S. statutory rate, the
U.S. tax impacts of non-U.S. earnings repatriation and any net impacts of
intercompany transactions. Changes in uncertain tax positions represent
changes in our net liability related to prior year tax positions. Excess tax
benefits from the exercise of stock options reflect the excess of actual tax
benefits received on employee exercises of stock options and other share-based
payments (which generally equals the income taxable to the employee) over the
amount of tax benefits that were calculated and recognized based on the grant
date fair values of such instruments.

Tax benefits credited to shareholders' equity totaled $190 for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2023. This primarily relates to the tax effects of net
investment hedges. Tax costs charged to shareholders' equity totaled $1,538
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. This primarily relates to the tax
effects of certain adjustments to pension obligations recorded in
shareholders' equity and the tax effects of net investment hedges.

Prior to the passage of the U.S. Tax Act, the Company asserted that
substantially all of the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries
were considered indefinitely invested and, accordingly, no deferred taxes were
provided. Pursuant to the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, these earnings were
subjected to a one-time transition tax. This charge included taxes for all
U.S. income taxes and for the related foreign withholding taxes for the
portion of those earnings which are no longer considered indefinitely
invested. We have not provided deferred taxes on approximately $24 billion of
earnings that are considered indefinitely invested.

positions is as follows:

48 The Procter & Gamble Company

Included in the total liability for uncertain tax positions at June 30, 2023,
is $354 that, depending on the ultimate resolution, could impact the effective
tax rate in future periods.

The Company is present in approximately 70 countries and over 150 taxable
jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 30-40 jurisdictional audits
underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and
establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by
local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the
underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are
reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and
circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and
the closing of statutes of limitation. Such adjustments are reflected in the
tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2010 and
forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate
settlement amounts until the close of the audit. Based on information
currently available, we anticipate that over the next 12-month period, audit
activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions in multiple
jurisdictions for which we have accrued existing liabilities of approximately
$40, including interest and penalties.

We recognize the additional accrual of any possible related interest and
penalties relating to the underlying uncertain tax position in income tax
expense. As of June 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we had accrued interest of $143,
$179 and $166 and accrued penalties of $12, $12 and $10, respectively, which
are not included in the above table. During the fiscal years ended June 30,
2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized $23, $21 and $38 in interest expense and
$1, $2 and $6 in penalties expense, respectively.

billion at June 30, 2022. If unused, approximately $300 will expire between
2023 and 2042. The remainder, totaling $2.6 billion at June 30, 2023, may be
carried forward indefinitely.

NOTE 6

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings
attributable to Procter & Gamble less preferred dividends by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted net
earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable
to Procter & Gamble by the diluted weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the year. The diluted shares include the dilutive effect of
stock options and other share-based awards based on the treasury stock method
(see Note 7) and the assumed conversion of preferred stock (see Note 8).

NOTE 7

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

The Company has two primary share-based compensation programs under which we
annually grant stock option, restricted stock unit (RSU) and performance stock
unit (PSU) awards to certain managers and directors.

In our main long-term incentive program, managers can elect to receive stock
options or RSUs. All options vest after three years and have a 10-year life.
Exercise prices on options are set equal to the market price of the underlying
shares on the date of the grant. RSUs vest and settle in shares of common
stock three years from the grant date.

Senior-level executives participate in an additional long-term incentive
program that awards PSUs, which are paid in shares after the end of a three-
year performance period subject to pre-established performance goals. The
program includes a Relative Total Shareholder Return (R-TSR) modifier under
which the number of shares ultimately granted is also impacted by the
Company's actual shareholder return relative to our consumer products
competitive peer set.

In addition to these long-term incentive programs, we award RSUs to the
Company's non-employee directors and make other minor stock option and RSU
grants to employees for which the terms are not substantially different from
our long-term incentive awards.

The Company's share-based compensation plan was approved by shareholders in
2019. Under the 2019 plan, a maximum of 150 million shares of common stock was
authorized for issuance and a total of 96 million shares remain available for
grant.

The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense based on the fair
value of the awards at the date of grant. The expense is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Awards to employees
eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are
recognized as compensation expense ratably from the grant date through the
date the employee first becomes eligible to retire and/or is no longer
required to provide services to earn the award. Share-based compensation
expense is included as part of Cost of products sold and SG&A in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings and includes an estimate of forfeitures,
which is based on historical data.

Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise
specified.

We utilize an industry standard lattice-based valuation model to calculate the
fair value for stock options granted. Assumptions utilized in the model, which
are evaluated and revised to reflect market conditions and experience, were as
follows:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

Weighted average interest rate| 3.7 | %| | 1.5 | %| | 0.6 | %  
Dividend yield| 2.6 | %| | 2.4 | %| | 2.4 | %  
Expected volatility| 21 | %| | 19 | %| | 20 | %  
Expected life in years| 8.8| | 9.1| | 9.2  
  
Lattice-based option valuation models incorporate ranges of assumptions for
inputs and those ranges are disclosed in the preceding table. Expected
volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatility of our stock
and implied volatilities of call options on our stock. We use historical data
to estimate option exercise and employee termination patterns within the
valuation model. The expected life of options granted is derived from the
output of the option valuation model and represents the average period of time
that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The interest rate for
periods within the contractual life of the options is based on the U.S.
Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

We utilize a Monte-Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of
performance stock units granted. Assumptions utilized in the model are not
substantially different from those used for stock options.

A summary of options outstanding under the plans as of June 30, 2023, and

At June 30, 2023, $218 of compensation cost had not yet been recognized
related to RSUs and PSUs. That cost is expected to be recognized over a
remaining weighted average period of 1.7 years. The total grant date fair
value of shares vested was $220, $248 and $266 in 2023, 2022 and 2021,
respectively.

The Company settles equity issuances with treasury shares. We have no specific
policy to repurchase common shares to mitigate the dilutive impact of options,
RSUs and PSUs. However, we have historically made adequate discretionary
purchases, based on cash availability, market trends and other factors, to
offset the impacts of such activity.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

We offer various postretirement benefits to our employees.

Defined Contribution Retirement Plans

We have defined contribution plans, which cover the majority of our U.S.
employees, as well as employees in certain other countries. These plans are
fully funded. We generally make contributions to participants' accounts based
on individual base salaries and years of service. Total global defined
contribution expense was $392, $366 and $340 in 2023, 2022 and 2021,
respectively.

The primary U.S. defined contribution plan (the U.S. DC plan) comprises the
majority of the expense for the Company's defined contribution plans. For the
U.S. DC plan, the contribution rate is set annually. Total contributions for
this plan approximated 13% of total participants' annual wages and salaries in
2023 and 14% in 2022 and 2021.

We maintain The Procter & Gamble Profit Sharing Trust (Trust) and Employee
Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) to provide a portion of the funding for the U.S.
DC plan and other retiree benefits (described below). Operating details of the
ESOP are provided at the end of this Note. The fair value of the ESOP Series A
shares allocated to participants reduces our cash contribution required to
fund the U.S. DC plan.

Defined Benefit Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits

We offer defined benefit retirement pension plans to certain employees. These
benefits relate primarily to plans outside the U.S. and, to a lesser extent,
plans assumed in previous acquisitions covering U.S. employees.

We also provide certain other retiree benefits, primarily health care benefits
for the majority of our U.S. employees who become eligible for these benefits
when they meet minimum age and service requirements. The plans require cost
sharing with retirees and the benefits are funded by ESOP Series B shares and
certain other assets contributed by the Company.

the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.

(4)For the other retiree benefits, the amendment primarily relates to
adjustments in the self-insured U.S. retiree health care program to utilize
fully-insured Medicare Advantage Programs impacting fiscal year 2022.

(5)Represents the net impact of ESOP debt service requirements, which is
netted against plan assets for other retiree benefits.

The actuarial gain for pension plans in 2023 was primarily related to
increases in discount rates, offset by inflation-related pension benefit
increases. The actuarial gain for other retiree benefits in 2023 was primarily
related to increases in discount rates and a decrease in assumptions for
medical claims costs. The actuarial gain for pension plans in 2022 was
primarily related to increases in discount rates. The actuarial gain for other
retiree benefits in 2022 was primarily related to increases in discount rates,
partially offset by unfavorable medical claim experience.

The underfunding of pension benefits is primarily a function of the different
funding incentives that exist outside of the U.S. In certain countries, there
are no legal requirements or financial incentives provided to companies to
pre-fund pension obligations prior to their due date. In these instances,
benefit payments are typically paid directly from the Company's cash as they
become due.

For plans that make up the majority of our obligation, the Company calculates
the benefit obligation and the related impacts on service and interest costs
using specific spot rates along the corporate bond yield curve. For the
remaining plans, the Company determines these amounts utilizing a single
weighted average discount rate derived from the corporate bond yield curve
used to measure the plan obligations.

Several factors are considered in developing the estimate for the long-term
expected rate of return on plan assets. For the defined benefit retirement
plans, these factors include historical rates of return of broad equity and
bond indices and projected long-term rates of return obtained from pension
investment consultants. The expected long-term rates of return for plan assets
are 8 \- 9% for equities and 3 \- 5% for bonds. For other retiree benefit
plans, the expected long-term rate of return reflects that the assets are
comprised primarily of Company stock. The expected rate of return on Company
stock is based on the long-term projected return of 8.5% and reflects the
historical pattern of returns.

Plan Assets. Our investment objective for defined benefit retirement plan
assets is to meet the plans' benefit obligations and to improve plan self-
sufficiency for future benefit obligations. The investment strategies focus on
asset class diversification, liquidity to meet benefit payments and an
appropriate balance of long-term investment return and risk. Target ranges for
asset allocations are determined by assessing different investment risks and
matching the actuarial projections of the plans' future liabilities and
benefit payments with current as well as expected long-term rates of return on
the assets, taking into account investment return volatility and correlations
across asset classes. Plan assets are diversified across several investment
managers and are generally invested in liquid funds that are selected to track
broad market equity and bond indices. Investment risk is carefully controlled
with plan assets rebalanced to target allocations on a periodic basis and with
continual monitoring of investment managers' performance relative to the
investment guidelines established with each investment manager.

Our target asset allocation for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, and
actual asset allocation by asset category as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, were
as follows:| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

(2)Fixed income securities are estimated by using pricing models or quoted
prices of securities with similar characteristics.

(3)Fair values of insurance contracts are valued based on either their cash
equivalent value or models that project future cash flows and discount the
future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs,
including credit risk and interest rate curves. The activity for Level 3
assets is not significant for all years presented.

(4)Investments valued using net asset value as a practical expedient are
primarily equity and fixed income collective funds.

Cash Flows. Management's best estimate of cash requirements and discretionary
contributions for the defined benefit retirement plans and other retiree
benefit plans for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, is $206 and $52,
respectively. Expected contributions are dependent on many variables,
including the variability of the market value of the plan assets as compared
to the benefit obligation and other market or regulatory conditions. In
addition, we take into consideration our business investment opportunities and
resulting cash requirements. Accordingly, actual funding may differ
significantly from current estimates.

Total benefit payments expected to be paid to participants, which include
payments funded from the Company's assets and payments from the plans are as
follows:

| | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Fiscal years ending June 30| Pension Benefits| | Other Retiree Benefits

Employee Stock Ownership Plan

We maintain the ESOP to provide funding for certain employee benefits
discussed in the preceding paragraphs.

The ESOP borrowed $1.0 billion in 1989 and the proceeds were used to purchase
Series A ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock to fund a portion of the
U.S. DC plan. Principal and interest requirements of the borrowing were paid
by the Trust from dividends on the preferred shares and from advances provided
by the Company. The original borrowing of $1.0 billion has been repaid in
full, and advances from the Company of $8 remain outstanding at June 30, 2023.
Each share is convertible at the option of the holder into one share of the
Company's common stock. The dividend for the current year was equal to the
common stock dividend of $3.68 per share. The liquidation value is $6.82 per
share.

In 1991, the ESOP borrowed an additional $1.0 billion. The proceeds were used
to purchase Series B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock to fund a
portion of retiree health care benefits. These shares, net of the ESOP's debt,
are considered plan assets of the other retiree benefits plan discussed above.
The original borrowings of $1.0 billion were repaid in 2021. Debt service
requirements were funded by preferred stock dividends, cash contributions and
advances provided by the Company, of which $814 are outstanding at June 30,
2023. Each share is convertible at the option of the holder into one share of
the Company's common stock. The dividend for the current year was equal to the
common stock dividend of $3.68 per share. The liquidation value is $12.96 per
share.

56 The Procter & Gamble Company

Our ESOP accounting practices are consistent with current ESOP accounting
guidance, including the permissible continuation of certain provisions from
prior accounting guidance. ESOP debt, which was guaranteed by the Company, was
recorded as debt with an offset to the Reserve for ESOP debt retirement, which
is presented within Shareholders' equity. Advances to the ESOP by the Company
are recorded as an increase in the Reserve for ESOP debt retirement. Interest
incurred on the ESOP debt was recorded as Interest expense. Dividends on all
preferred shares are charged to Retained earnings.

The series A and B preferred shares of the ESOP are allocated to employees
based on debt service requirements. The number of preferred shares outstanding
at June 30 was as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Shares in thousands| 2023| | 2022| | 2021

TOTAL SERIES B| 50,039 | | | 50,839 | | | 51,552 |  
  
For purposes of calculating diluted net earnings per common share, the
preferred shares held by the ESOP are considered converted from inception.

RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to
market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and
commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take
advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. To the extent we choose
to manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various
financial transactions that we account for using the applicable accounting
guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial
transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty
exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices.

If the Company elects to do so and if the instrument meets certain specified
accounting criteria, management designates derivative instruments as cash flow
hedges, fair value hedges or net investment hedges. We record derivative
instruments at fair value and the accounting for changes in the fair value
depends on the intended use of the derivative, the resulting designation and
the effectiveness of the instrument in offsetting the risk exposure it is
designed to hedge. We generally have a high degree of effectiveness between
the exposure being hedged and the hedging instrument.

Credit Risk Management

We have counterparty credit guidelines and normally enter into transactions
with investment grade financial institutions, to the extent commercially
viable. Counterparty exposures are monitored daily and downgrades in
counterparty credit ratings are reviewed on a timely basis. We have not
incurred, and do not expect to incur, material credit losses on our risk
management or other financial instruments.

Substantially all of the Company's financial instruments used in hedging
transactions are governed by industry standard netting and collateral
agreements with counterparties. If the Company's credit rating were to fall
below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand
either collateralization or termination of the arrangements. The aggregate
fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are
in a net liability position was $1,088 and $219 as of June 30, 2023 and 2022,
respectively. The Company has not been required to post collateral as a result
of these contractual features.

Interest Rate Risk Management

Our policy is to manage interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and
variable-rate debt. To manage this risk in a cost-efficient manner, we enter
into interest rate swaps whereby we agree to exchange with the counterparty,
at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest
amounts calculated by reference to a notional amount.

We designate certain interest rate swaps on fixed rate debt that meet specific
accounting criteria as fair value hedges. For fair value hedges, the changes
in the fair value of both the hedging instruments and the underlying debt
obligations are immediately recognized in earnings.

Foreign Currency Risk Management

We manufacture and sell our products and finance our operations in a number of
countries throughout the world. As a result, we are exposed to movements in
foreign currency exchange rates. We leverage the Company's diversified
portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge. In certain cases, we enter into
non-qualifying foreign currency contracts to hedge certain balance sheet items
subject to revaluation. The change in fair value of these instruments and the
underlying exposure are both immediately recognized in earnings.

Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise
specified.

* * *

The Procter & Gamble Company 57

To manage exchange rate risk related to our intercompany financing, we
primarily use forward contracts and currency swaps. The change in fair value
of these non-qualifying instruments is immediately recognized in earnings,
substantially offsetting the foreign currency mark-to-market impact of the
related exposure.

Net Investment Hedging

We hedge certain net investment positions in foreign subsidiaries. To
accomplish this, we either borrow directly in foreign currencies and designate
all or a portion of the foreign currency debt as a hedge of the applicable net
investment position or we enter into foreign currency swaps that are
designated as hedges of net investments. The time value component of the net
investment hedge currency swaps is excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness. Changes in the fair value of the swap, including changes in the
fair value of the excluded time value component, are recognized in OCI and
offset the value of the net investment being hedged. The time value component
is subsequently reported in income on a systematic basis.

Commodity Risk Management

Certain raw materials used in our products or production processes are subject
to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and
economic variables and other unpredictable factors. As of and during the
fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we did not have any financial
commodity hedging activity.

Insurance

We self-insure for most insurable risks. However, we purchase insurance for
Directors and Officers Liability and certain other coverage where it is
required by law or by contract.

Fair Value Hierarchy

Accounting guidance on fair value measurements for certain financial assets
and liabilities requires that financial assets and liabilities carried at fair
value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:

•Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities.

•Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are
corroborated by market data.

•Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own
assumptions or external inputs from inactive markets.

The Company had no significant activity with Level 3 assets and liabilities
during the periods presented. When applying fair value principles in the
valuation of assets and liabilities, we are required to maximize the use of
quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company
has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of
any financial assets or liabilities during the year.

When active market quotes are not available for financial assets and
liabilities, we use industry standard valuation models. Where applicable,
these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a
present value using market-based observable inputs including credit risk,
interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies. In
circumstances where market-based observable inputs are not available,
management judgment is used to develop assumptions to estimate fair value.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value

Cash equivalents were $6.8 billion and $6.0 billion as of June 30, 2023 and
2022, respectively, and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value
hierarchy. The Company had no other material investments in debt or equity
securities during the periods presented.

The fair value of long-term debt was $26.9 billion and $25.7 billion as of
June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. This includes the current portion of
long-term debt instruments ($3.9 billion as of June 30, 2023, and $3.6 billion
as of June 30, 2022). Certain long-term debt (debt designated as a fair value
hedge) is recorded at fair value. All other long-term debt is recorded at
amortized cost but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. We
consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values are
generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar
instruments.

The fair value of the interest rate derivative asset/liability directly
offsets the cumulative amount of the fair value hedging adjustment included in
the carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation. The carrying amount of
the underlying debt obligation, which includes the unamortized discount or
premium and the fair value adjustment, was $3.6 billion and $4.7 billion as of
June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition to the foreign currency
derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our
foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment
hedges. The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net
investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency
transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $11.8 billion and $11.2
billion as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in the
notional balance of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges
is primarily driven by the Company's decision to leverage favorable interest
rate spreads in the foreign currency swap market. The decrease in the notional
balance of foreign currency contracts not designated as hedging instruments
reflects changes in the level of intercompany financing activity during the
period.

Derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets
or Other noncurrent assets. Derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued
and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities. Changes in the fair
value of net investment hedges are recognized in the Foreign currency
translation component of Other comprehensive income (OCI). All of the
Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are
classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

relationships are categorized as follows:

(2)In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net
investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt
instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The amount of gain/(loss)

NOTE 12

LEASES

The Company determines whether a contract contains a lease at the inception of
a contract by determining if the contract conveys the right to control the use
of identified property, plant or equipment for a period of time in exchange
for consideration. We lease certain real estate, machinery, equipment,
vehicles and office equipment for varying periods. Many of these leases
include an option to either renew or terminate the lease. For purposes of
calculating lease liabilities, these options are included within the lease
term when it has become reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such
options. The incremental borrowing rate utilized to calculate our lease
liabilities is based on the information available at commencement date, as
most of the leases do not provide an implicit borrowing rate. Our operating
lease agreements do not contain any material guarantees or restrictive
covenants. The Company does not have any material finance leases or sublease
activities. Short-term leases, defined as leases with initial terms of 12
months or less, are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Lease
expense for such short-term leases is not material. The most significant
assets in our leasing portfolio relate to real estate and vehicles. For
purposes of calculating lease liabilities for such leases, we have combined
lease and non-lease components.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Guarantees

In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, we may
provide routine indemnifications (e.g., indemnification for representations
and warranties and retention of previously existing environmental, tax and
employee liabilities) for which terms range in duration and, in some
circumstances, are not explicitly defined. The maximum obligation under some
indemnifications is also not explicitly stated and, as a result, the overall
amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. We have not made
significant payments for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to
incur a loss on any of these matters, the loss would not have a material
effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise
specified.

* * *

62 The Procter & Gamble Company

In certain situations, we guarantee loans for suppliers and customers. The
total amount of guarantees issued under such arrangements is not material.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable
interest entities, that have a material impact on our financial statements.

Purchase Commitments

We have purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services and property,
plant and equipment as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made
under take-or-pay obligations are as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Fiscal years ending June 30| 2024| 2025| 2026| 2027| 2028| Thereafter  
Purchase obligations| $| 1,169 | | $| 597 | | $| 379 | | $| 314 | | $| 168 | |
$| 362 |  
  
Such amounts represent minimum commitments under take-or-pay agreements with
suppliers and are in line with expected usage. These amounts include purchase
commitments related to service contracts for information technology, human
resources management and facilities management activities that have been
outsourced to third-party suppliers. Due to the proprietary nature of many of
our materials and processes, certain supply contracts contain penalty
provisions for early termination. We do not expect to incur penalty payments
under these provisions that would materially affect our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

Litigation

We are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims
arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including
antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts,
environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and
tax. While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and
our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will
not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and
regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the
effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal
practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the
ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
