PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS| |  
---|---|---  
  
Overview

AbbVie or "the company" refer to AbbVie Inc., or AbbVie Inc. and its
consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires. AbbVie is a global,
diversified research-based biopharmaceutical company positioned for success
with a comprehensive product portfolio that has leadership positions across
immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. AbbVie uses its
expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and
market advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and
serious diseases. AbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On
January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a
result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100% of the
outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders.

Segments

AbbVie operates as a single global business segment dedicated to the research
and development, manufacturing, commercialization and sale of innovative
medicines and therapies. This operating structure enables the Chief Executive
Officer, as chief operating decision maker (CODM), to allocate resources and
assess business performance on a global basis in order to achieve established
long-term strategic goals. Consistent with this structure, a global research
and development and supply chain organization is responsible for the
discovery, development, manufacturing and supply of products. Commercial
efforts that coordinate the marketing, sales and distribution of these
products are organized by geographic region or therapeutic area. All of these
activities are supported by a global corporate administrative staff. The
determination of a single business segment is consistent with the consolidated
financial information regularly reviewed by the CODM for purposes of assessing
performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods.
See Note 16, "Segment and Geographic Area Information" to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included under Item 8, "Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data" and the sales information related to AbbVie's key products
and geographies included under Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

AbbVie has the rights to sell Creon and Synthroid only in the United States.

Marketing, Sales and Distribution Capabilities

AbbVie utilizes a combination of dedicated commercial resources, regional
commercial resources and distributorships to market, sell and distribute its
products worldwide. AbbVie directs its primary marketing efforts toward
securing the prescription, or recommendation, of its brand of products by
physicians, external experts and other health care providers. Managed care
providers (for example, health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit
managers), hospitals and state and federal government agencies (for example,
State Medicaid programs, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and
the United States Department of Defense) are also important customers. AbbVie
also markets directly to consumers themselves, although in the United States
many of the company's products must be sold pursuant to a prescription.
Outside of the United States, AbbVie focuses its promotional and market access
efforts on external experts, payers, physicians and health systems. AbbVie
also provides patient support programs closely related to its products.

AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers,
distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty
pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers
and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and
devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare
providers. Although AbbVie's business does not have significant seasonality,
AbbVie's product revenues may be affected by end customer and retail buying
patterns, fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels and other factors.

In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally
through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to
retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. In 2022, three wholesale
distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and
AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's
pharmaceutical product sales in the United States. No individual wholesaler
accounted for greater than 39% of AbbVie's 2022 gross revenues in the United
States. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to
wholesalers or through distributors, and depending on the market works through
largely centralized national payers system to agree on reimbursement terms.

Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie
has no single customer that, if the customer were lost, would have a material
adverse effect on the company's business. No material portion of AbbVie's
business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at
the election of the government. Orders are generally filled on a current basis
and order backlog is not material to AbbVie's business.

Competition

The markets for AbbVie's products are highly competitive. AbbVie competes with
other research-based pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies that
discover, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products,
therapies and biologics. For example, AbbVie's immunology products compete
with anti-TNF products, JAK inhibitors and other competitive products intended
to treat a number of disease states, and AbbVie's oncology products compete
with BTK inhibitors. In addition, in the past few years, a number of other
companies have started to develop, have successfully developed and/or are
currently marketing products that are being positioned as competitors to
Botox. The search for technological innovations in pharmaceutical products is
a significant aspect of competition. The introduction of new products by
competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result in
product obsolescence. Price is also a competitive factor. In addition, the
substitution of generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical products for branded
pharmaceutical products creates competitive pressures on AbbVie's products
that do not have patent protection. New products or treatments brought to
market by AbbVie's competitors could cause revenues for AbbVie's products to
decrease due to price reductions and sales volume decreases.

Biosimilars. Competition for AbbVie's biologic products is affected by the
approval of follow-on biologics, also known as "biosimilars." Biologics have
added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases, including
some for which therapies were unavailable or inadequate. The cost of
developing and producing biologic therapies is typically dramatically higher
than for small molecule medications, and many biologic medications are used
for ongoing treatment of chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or
inflammatory bowel disease, or for the treatment of previously untreatable
cancer. Significant investments in biologics infrastructure and manufacturing
are necessary to produce biologic products.

Humira is now facing direct biosimilar competition in Europe, the United
States and other countries, and AbbVie will continue to face competitive
pressure from these biologics and from orally administered products.

In the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FFDCA), the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and
the regulations implementing these statutes. The enactment of federal health
care reform legislation in March 2010 provided a pathway for approval of
biosimilars under the PHSA, but the approval process for, and science behind,
biosimilars is complex. Approval by the FDA is dependent upon many factors,
including a showing that the biosimilar is "highly similar" to the original
product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product
in terms of safety, purity and potency. The types of data that could
ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity may include
analytical data, bioequivalence studies and studies to demonstrate chemical
similarity, animal studies (including toxicity studies) and clinical studies.

Furthermore, the law provides that only a biosimilar product that is
determined to be "interchangeable" will be considered by the FDA as
substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of
the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product. To
prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable, the applicant must
demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical
results as the original biologic product in any given patient, and if the
product is administered more than once in a patient, that safety risks and
potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use
of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic
product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product
without switching. The law continues to be interpreted and implemented by the
FDA. As a result, its full ultimate impact, implementation and meaning remains
subject to uncertainty.

Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity

Generally, upon approval, products may be entitled to certain kinds of
exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes.
AbbVie's intellectual property is materially valuable to the company, and
AbbVie seeks patent protection, where available, in all significant markets
and/or countries for each product in development. In the United States, the
expiration date for patents is 20 years after the filing date. Given that
patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the
development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical
trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval, the
length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly
less than 20 years. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act
of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent holder to
seek a patent extension, commonly called a "patent term restoration," for
patents on products (or processes for making the product) regulated by the
FFDCA. The length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of
the period of time from the filing of an Investigational New Drug Application
(NDA) for a

compound to the submission of the NDA for such compound, plus 100 percent of
the time period from NDA submission to regulatory approval. The extension,
however, cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after
regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years. Biological products licensed under
the PHSA are similarly eligible for terms of patent restoration.

Pharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory
exclusivity upon approval. The scope, length and requirements for each of
these exclusivities vary both in the United States and in other jurisdictions.
In the United States, if the FDA approves a conventional drug product that
contains an active ingredient not previously approved, the product is
typically entitled to five years of non-patent regulatory exclusivity.
Specific conditions of use approved for individual products may also be
entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the FDA's
reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the NDA
applicant. If the NDA applicant studies the product for use by children, the
FDA may grant pediatric exclusivity, which extends by 180 days all existing
exclusivities (patent and regulatory) related to the product. For products
that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small
population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the
research and development costs will be recovered, the FDA may designate the
pharmaceutical as an orphan drug and grant it seven years of exclusivity.
Other types of regulatory exclusivity may also be available, such as
Generating New Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) exclusivity, which can provide
new antibiotic or new antifungal drugs an additional five years of exclusivity
to be added to certain exclusivities already provided for by law.

Applicable laws and regulations dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which
a product or particular characteristics of a product is entitled upon approval
in any particular country. In certain instances, regulatory exclusivity may
offer protection where patent protection is no longer available or for a
period of time in excess of patent protection. It is not possible to estimate
for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity to
which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained or
sometimes even later. However, given the length of time required to complete
clinical development of a pharmaceutical product, the periods of exclusivity
that might be achieved in any individual case would not generally be expected
to exceed a minimum of three years and a maximum of 14 years. These estimates
do not consider other factors, such as the difficulty of recreating the
manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge
that may delay the introduction of a generic or other follow-on product after
the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods.

Biologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition
and Innovation Act, which was passed on March 23, 2010 as Title VII to the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The law provides a pathway for
approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of regulatory
exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 day-
extension term for conducting pediatric studies. Biologics are also eligible
for orphan drug exclusivity, as discussed above. The law also includes an
extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to
litigate patent infringement, validity and enforceability. The European Union
has also created a pathway for approval of biosimilars and has published
guidelines for approval of certain biosimilar products. The more complex
nature of biologics and biosimilar products has led to close regulatory
scrutiny over follow-on biosimilar products, which can reduce the effect of
biosimilars on sales of the innovator biologic as compared to the sales
erosion caused by generic versions of small molecule pharmaceutical products.

AbbVie owns or has licensed rights to a substantial number of patents and
patent applications. AbbVie licenses or owns a patent portfolio of thousands
of patent families, each of which includes United States patent applications
and/or issued patents and may also contain the non-United States counterparts
to these patents and applications.

These patents and applications, including various patents that expire during
the period 2023 to the early 2040s, in aggregate are believed to be of
material importance in the operation of AbbVie's business. However, AbbVie
believes that no single patent, license, trademark (or related group of
patents, licenses, or trademarks), except for those related to adalimumab
(which is sold under the trademark Humira), are material in relation to the
company's business as a whole. AbbVie has entered into settlement and license
agreements with several adalimumab biosimilar manufacturers. Under the
agreements, the licenses in the United States begin in 2023 and the licenses
in Europe began in 2018.

In addition, the following patents, licenses and trademarks are significant:
those related to ibrutinib (which is sold under the trademark Imbruvica),
those related to risankizumab (which is sold under the trademark Skyrizi) and
those related to upadacitinib (which is sold under the trademark Rinvoq). The
United States composition of matter patent covering ibrutinib is expected to
expire in 2027, with pediatric regulatory exclusivity then extending until May
2028. However, no generic entry for any ibrutinib product is expected prior to
March 30, 2032. The United States composition of matter patent covering
risankizumab is expected to expire in 2033. And the United States composition
of matter patent covering upadacitinib is expected to expire in 2033.

AbbVie may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect its
technology. AbbVie seeks to protect its technology and product candidates, in
part, by confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, advisors,

contractors and collaborators. These agreements may be breached and AbbVie may
not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, AbbVie's trade secrets
may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To
the extent that AbbVie's employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and
collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the
company, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how
and inventions.

Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements

In addition to its independent efforts to develop and market products, AbbVie
enters into arrangements such as acquisitions, option-to-acquire agreements,
licensing arrangements, option-to-license arrangements, strategic alliances,
co-promotion arrangements, co-development and co-marketing agreements and
joint ventures. The acquisitions and option-to-acquire agreements typically
include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable purchase price
payments or option fees, option exercise payments, milestones or earn-outs and
other customary terms and obligations. The licensing and other arrangements
typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable upfront
license fees, option fees and option exercise payments, milestone payments and
royalty and/or profit sharing obligations. See Note 5, "Licensing,
Acquisitions and Other Arrangements--Other Licensing & Acquisitions Activity,"
to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, "Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data."

Third Party Agreements

AbbVie has agreements with third parties for process development, product
distribution, analytical services and manufacturing of certain products.
AbbVie procures certain products and services from a limited number of
suppliers and, in some cases, a single supply source. In addition, AbbVie has
agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredient and product
manufacturing, formulation and development services, fill, finish and
packaging services, transportation and distribution and logistics services for
certain products. AbbVie does not believe that these manufacturing-related
agreements are material because AbbVie's business is not substantially
dependent on any individual agreement. In most cases, AbbVie maintains
alternate supply relationships that it can utilize without undue disruption of
its manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual
obligations. AbbVie seeks to maintain sufficient inventory of product to
minimize the impact of any supply disruption.

AbbVie is also party to certain collaborations and other arrangements, as
discussed in Note 5, "Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements--Other
Licensing & Acquisitions Activity," to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included under Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials

AbbVie purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and
supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around the world.
In addition, certain medical devices and components necessary for the
manufacture of AbbVie products are provided by unaffiliated third party
suppliers. Despite the disruption to the global supply chain caused by
COVID-19, AbbVie has continued to supply patients with no material supply
impact, except for the previously-disclosed supply issues impacting Lupron.
Given the general increased global volatility due to the pandemic, AbbVie is
monitoring and taking actions to mitigate potential supply shortages which may
impact the fulfillment of product demand.

Research and Development Activities

AbbVie makes a significant investment in research and development and has
numerous compounds (and complementary devices) in clinical development,
including potential treatments for complex, life-threatening diseases.
AbbVie's ability to discover and develop new compounds is enhanced by the
company's use of integrated discovery and development project teams, which
include chemists, biologists, physicians and pharmacologists who work on the
same compounds as a team. AbbVie also partners with third parties, such as
biotechnology companies, other pharmaceutical companies and academic
institutions to identify and prioritize promising new treatments that
complement and enhance AbbVie's existing portfolio. AbbVie also supplements
its research and development efforts with acquisitions.

The research and development process generally begins with discovery research
which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect
against a given disease. If preclinical testing of an identified compound
proves successful, the compound moves into clinical development which
generally includes the following phases:

•Phase 1-- involves the first human tests in a small number of healthy
volunteers or patients to assess safety, tolerability and doses for later
phases.

•Phase 2-- tests different doses of the drug in a disease state in order to
assess efficacy.

•Phase 3-- tests a drug that demonstrates favorable results in the earlier
phases in a significantly larger patient population to further demonstrate
efficacy and safety in order to meet requirements to enable global approval.

Preclinical data and clinical trials from all of the development phases
provide the data required to prepare and submit an NDA, a Biological License
Application (BLA) or other submission for regulatory approval to the FDA or
similar government agencies outside the United States. The specific
requirements (e.g., scope of clinical trials) for obtaining regulatory
approval vary across different countries and geographic regions.

The research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch
typically takes 8 to 12 years and can be even longer. The research and
development of new pharmaceutical products has a significant amount of
inherent uncertainty. There is no guarantee when, or if, a molecule will
receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication.

In addition to the development of new products, delivery devices and new
formulations, research and development projects also may include Phase 4
trials, sometimes called post-marketing studies. For such projects, clinical
trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding, among
other parameters, the benefits and risks of an approved drug.

Regulation--Discovery and Clinical Development

United States. Securing approval to market a new pharmaceutical product in the
United States requires substantial effort and financial resources and takes
several years to complete. The applicant must complete preclinical tests and
submit protocols to the FDA before commencing clinical trials. Clinical trials
are intended to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical
product and typically are conducted in sequential phases, although the phases
may overlap or be combined. If the required clinical testing is successful,
the results are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting
approval to market the product for one or more indications. The FDA reviews an
NDA or BLA to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its
intended use and whether its manufacturing is compliant with current Good
Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).

Compliance with regulatory requirements is assured through periodic, announced
or unannounced inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and
these inspections associated with clinical development may include the
sponsor, investigator sites, laboratories, hospitals and manufacturing
facilities of AbbVie's subcontractors or other third-party manufacturers.
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in
enforcement action by the FDA, including rejection of an NDA or BLA.

Even if an NDA or a BLA receives approval, the applicant must comply with
post-approval requirements. For example, holders of an approval must report
adverse reactions, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply
with requirements concerning advertising and promotional materials and
activities. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue
to conform to cGMP after approval, and certain changes to the manufacturing
procedures and finished product must be submitted and approved by the FDA
prior to implementation. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing
facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural
and record keeping requirements. In addition, as a condition of approval, the
FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to further assess and
monitor the product's safety or efficacy after commercialization, which may
require additional clinical trials, patient registries, observational data or
additional work on chemistry, manufacturing and controls. Any post-approval
regulatory obligations, and the cost of complying with such obligations, could
expand in the future. Further, the FDA continues to regulate product labeling,
and prohibits the promotion of products for unapproved or "off-label" uses
along with other labeling restrictions.

Outside the United States. AbbVie is subject to similar regulatory
requirements outside the United States for approval and marketing of
pharmaceutical products. AbbVie must obtain approval of a clinical trial
application or product from applicable supervising regulatory authorities
before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in target
markets. The approval requirements and process for each country can vary, and
the time required to obtain approval may be longer or shorter than that
required for FDA approval in the United States. For example, AbbVie may submit
marketing authorizations in the European Union under either a centralized or
decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is mandatory for the
approval of biotechnology products and many pharmaceutical products and
provides for a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European
Union member states. Under the centralized procedure, a single marketing
authorization application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency. After
the agency evaluates the application, it makes a recommendation to the
European Commission, which then makes the final determination on whether to
approve the application. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual
recognition of individual national approval decisions and is available for
products that are not subject to the centralized procedure.

In Japan, applications for approval of a new product are made through the
Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). Japan-specific trials and/or
bridging studies to demonstrate that the non-Japanese clinical data applies to
Japanese patients may be required. After completing a comprehensive review,
the PMDA reports to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, which then
approves or denies the application.

Similarly, applications for a new product in China are submitted to the Center
for Drug Evaluation of the National Medical Products Administration for
technical review and approval of a product for marketing in China. Clinical
data in Chinese subjects are usually required to support approval in China,
requiring the inclusion of China in global pivotal studies, or a separate
China/Asian clinical trial.

The regulatory process in many emerging markets continues to evolve. Many
emerging markets, including those in Asia, generally require regulatory
approval to have been obtained in a large developed market (such as the United
States or Europe) before the country will begin or complete its regulatory
review process. Similar to the requirements in Japan and China, certain
countries (notably South Korea, Taiwan, India and Russia) also generally
require that clinical studies that include data from patients in those
countries be conducted in order to support local regulatory approval.

The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product
licensing also vary. In addition, post-approval regulatory obligations such as
adverse event reporting and cGMP compliance generally apply and may vary by
country. For example, after a marketing authorization has been granted in the
European Union, periodic safety reports must be submitted and other
pharmacovigilance measures may be required (such as Risk Management Plans).

Regulation--Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing

The manufacturing, marketing, sale, promotion and distribution of AbbVie's
products are subject to comprehensive government regulation. Government
regulation by various national, regional, federal, state and local agencies,
both in the United States and other countries, addresses (among other matters)
inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical
investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging,
marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution,
quality control, post-marketing surveillance, record keeping, storage and
disposal practices. AbbVie's operations are also affected by trade regulations
in many countries that limit the import of raw materials and finished products
and by laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the
marketplace (including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the
United Kingdom Bribery Act, which provide guidance on corporate interactions
with government officials) and require safeguards for the protection of
personal data. In addition, AbbVie is subject to laws and regulations
pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-
kickback and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug
manufacturers such as AbbVie are also subject to taxes, as well as
application, product, user and other fees.

Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects
AbbVie's business. Among other effects, health care regulations substantially
increase the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining
approval to market newly developed and existing products. AbbVie expects
compliance with these regulations to continue to require significant technical
expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can
delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement
actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of
the authority necessary for a product's production and sale and other civil or
criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties.

In addition to regulatory initiatives, AbbVie's business can be affected by
ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy and outcomes of health
care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry
participants, government agencies and others. These studies can lead to
updates to the data regarding utilization, safety and efficacy of previously
marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the
future result, in the discontinuance of, or limitations on, marketing of such
products domestically or worldwide, and may give rise to claims for damages
from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use.

Access to human health care products continues to be a subject of oversight,
investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies and
private organizations in the United States and other countries. A major focus
is cost containment. Efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made
in the private sector, notably by health care payers and providers, which have
instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. AbbVie expects
insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of health care
products. Outside the United States, many countries control the price of
health care products directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment,
pricing, coverage limitations, or compulsory licensing. Political and
budgetary pressures in the United States and in other countries may also
heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on AbbVie's products for
the foreseeable future.

United States. Specifically, U.S. federal laws require pharmaceutical
manufacturers to pay certain statutorily-prescribed rebates to state Medicaid
programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state Medicaid plans, and the
efforts by states to seek additional rebates may affect AbbVie's business.
Similarly, the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as a prerequisite to
participation in Medicaid and other federal health care programs, requires
that manufacturers extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to
various federal agencies, including the United States Department of Veterans
Affairs, Department of Defense and Public Health Service entities and
institutions. In addition, recent legislative changes would require similarly
discounted prices to be offered to TRICARE program beneficiaries. The Veterans
Health Care

Act of 1992 also established the 340B drug discount program, which requires
pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide products at reduced prices to various
designated health care entities and facilities.

In the United States, most states also have generic substitution legislation
requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different
manufacturer's generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one
prescribed. In addition, the federal government follows a diagnosis-related
group (DRG) payment system for certain institutional services provided under
Medicare or Medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system (PPS)
for services delivered in hospital outpatient, nursing home and home health
settings. DRG and PPS entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement
based on the diagnosis and/or procedure rather than actual costs incurred in
patient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit
or control expenditures for many health care products. Medicare reimburses
Part B drugs based on average sales price plus a certain percentage to account
for physician administration costs, which have been reduced in the hospital
outpatient setting. Medicare enters into contracts with private plans to
negotiate prices for most patient-administered medicine delivered under Part
D.

Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and
Education Reconciliation Act (together, the Affordable Care Act), AbbVie pays
a fee related to its pharmaceuticals sales to government programs. In
addition, AbbVie provides a discount of 70% for branded prescription drugs
sold to patients who fall into the Medicare Part D coverage gap, or "donut
hole."

The Affordable Care Act also includes provisions known as the Physician
Payments Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of drugs and biologics
covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to
physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. Similar
reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the United
States, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or
are considering similar laws requiring disclosure of interactions with health
care professionals. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or
criminal fines and/or penalties.

European Union. The European Union has adopted directives and other
legislation governing labeling, advertising, distribution, supply,
pharmacovigilance and marketing of pharmaceutical products. Such legislation
provides mandatory standards throughout the European Union and permits member
states to supplement these standards with additional regulations. European
governments also regulate pharmaceutical product prices through their control
of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such
products to consumers. As a result, patients are unlikely to use a
pharmaceutical product that is not reimbursed by the government. In many
European countries, the government either regulates the pricing of a new
product at launch or subsequent launch through direct price controls or
reference pricing. In recent years, many countries have also imposed new or
additional cost containment measures on pharmaceutical products. Differences
between national pricing regimes create price differentials within the
European Union that can lead to significant parallel trade in pharmaceutical
products.

Most governments also promote generic substitution by mandating or permitting
a pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer's generic version of a
pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed and by permitting or mandating
that health care professionals prescribe generic versions in certain
circumstances. Many governments are also following a similar path for
biosimilar therapies. In addition, governments use reimbursement lists to
limit the pharmaceutical products that are eligible for reimbursement by
national health care systems.

Japan. In Japan, the National Health Insurance system maintains a Drug Price
List specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement,
and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare sets the prices of the products
on this list. The government generally introduces price cut rounds every other
year and also mandates price decreases for specific products. New products
judged innovative or useful, that are indicated for pediatric use, or that
target orphan or small population diseases, however, may be eligible for a
pricing premium. The government has also promoted the use of generics, where
available.

Emerging Markets. Many emerging markets take steps to reduce pharmaceutical
product prices, in some cases through direct price controls and in others
through the promotion of generic/biosimilar alternatives to branded
pharmaceuticals.

Since AbbVie markets its products worldwide, certain products of a local
nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local regulatory
requirements. Certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business
outside the United States, including price and currency exchange controls,
changes in currency exchange rates, limitations on participation in local
enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental action.

Regulation - Medical Devices

Medical devices are subject to regulation by the FDA, state agencies and
foreign government health authorities. FDA regulations, as well as various
U.S. federal and state laws, govern the development, clinical testing,
manufacturing, labeling, record keeping and marketing of medical device
products agencies in the United States. AbbVie's medical device product
candidates, including AbbVie's breast implants, must undergo rigorous clinical
testing and an extensive government regulatory clearance or approval process
prior to sale in the United States and other countries. The lengthy process of
clinical development and submissions for clearance or approval, and the
continuing need for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, require
the expenditure of substantial resources. Regulatory clearance or approval,
when and if obtained, may be limited in scope, and may significantly limit the
indicated uses for which a product may be marketed. Cleared or approved
products and their manufacturers are subject to ongoing review, and discovery
of previously unknown problems with products may result in restrictions on
their manufacture, sale and/or use or require their withdrawal from the
market.

United States. AbbVie's medical device products are subject to extensive
regulation by the FDA in the United States. Unless an exemption applies, each
medical device AbbVie markets in the United States must have a 510(k)
clearance or a Premarket Approval Application (PMA) in accordance with the
FFDCA and its implementing regulations. The FDA classifies medical devices
into one of three classes, depending on the degree of risk associated with
each medical device and the extent of controls that are needed to ensure
safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed to pose a lower risk are placed in
either Class I or Class II, and devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest
risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or a
device deemed to be not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared
510(k) device, are placed in Class III. In general, a Class III device cannot
be marketed in the United States unless the FDA approves the device after
submission of a PMA, and any changes to the device subsequent to initial FDA
approval must also be reviewed and approved by the FDA. The majority of
AbbVie's medical device products, including AbbVie's breast implants, are
regulated as Class III medical devices. A Class III device may have
significant additional obligations imposed in its conditions of approval, and
the time in which it takes to obtain approval can be long. Compliance with
regulatory requirements is assured through periodic, unannounced facility
inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and these inspections
may include the manufacturing facilities of AbbVie's subcontractors or other
third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory
requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include
any of the following sanctions: warning letters or untitled letters; fines,
injunctions and civil penalties; recall or seizure of AbbVie' products;
operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
refusing AbbVie' request for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products;
withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals that are already granted; and
criminal prosecution.

A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application and is
sometimes required for a 510(k) premarket notification. Clinical trials
generally require submission of an application for an investigational device
exemption (IDE), which must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal
and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in
humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. A study sponsor
must obtain approval for its IDE from the FDA, and it must also obtain
approval of its study from the Institutional Review Board overseeing the
trial. The results of clinical testing may not be sufficient to obtain
approval of the investigational device.

Once a device is approved, the manufacture and distribution of the device
remains subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including Quality System
Regulation requirements, which involve design, testing, control, documentation
and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process.
Medical device manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register
their establishments and list their manufactured devices with the FDA and are
subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state
agencies for compliance with regulatory requirements. Manufacturers must also
report to the FDA if their devices may have caused or contributed to a death
or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that could likely cause or
contribute to a death or serious injury, or if the manufacturer conducts a
field correction or product recall or removal to reduce a risk to health posed
by a device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may present a health
risk. Further, the FDA continues to regulate device labeling, and prohibits
the promotion of products for unapproved or "off-label" uses along with other
labeling restrictions.

European Union. Medical device products that are marketed in the European
Union must comply with the requirements of the Medical Device Regulation (the
MDR), which came into effect in May 2021. The MDR provides for regulatory
oversight with respect to the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling
and adverse event reporting for medical devices to ensure that medical devices
marketed in the European Union are safe and effective for their intended uses.
Medical devices that comply with the MDR are entitled to bear a Conformite
Europeenne marking evidencing such compliance and may be marketed in the
European Union. Failure to comply with these domestic and international
regulatory requirements could affect AbbVie's ability to market and sell
AbbVie's products in these countries.

Environmental Matters

AbbVie believes that its operations comply in all material respects with
applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection.
Regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent
limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various
manufacturing operations. AbbVie's capital expenditures for pollution control
in 2022 were approximately $12 million and operating expenditures were
approximately $35 million. In 2023, capital expenditures for pollution control
are estimated to be approximately $9 million and operating expenditures are
estimated to be approximately $37 million.

Abbott was identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in
investigations and/or remediations at several locations in the United States,
including Puerto Rico, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. Some of these
locations were transferred to AbbVie in connection with the separation and
distribution, and AbbVie has become a party to these investigations and
remediations. Abbott was also engaged in remediation at several other sites,
some of which have been transferred to AbbVie in connection with the
separation and distribution, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection
Agency or similar agencies. While it is not feasible to predict with certainty
the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities,
AbbVie believes that such costs, together with other expenditures to maintain
compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental
protection, should not have a material adverse effect on the company's
financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.

Employees

AbbVie employed approximately 50,000 employees in over 70 countries as of
January 31, 2023. Outside the United States, some of AbbVie's employees are
represented by unions or works councils. AbbVie believes that it has good
relations with its employees.

Human Capital Management

Attracting, retaining and providing meaningful growth and development
opportunities to AbbVie's employees is critical to the company's success in
making a remarkable impact on people's lives around the world. AbbVie
leverages numerous resources to identify and enhance strategic and leadership
capability, foster employee engagement and create a culture where diverse
talent is productive and engaged. AbbVie invests in its employees through
competitive compensation, benefits and employee support programs and offers
best-in-class development and leadership opportunities. AbbVie has developed a
deep talent base through ongoing investment in functional and leadership
training and by sourcing world-class external talent, ensuring a sustainable
talent pipeline. AbbVie continuously cultivates and enhances its working
culture and embraces equality, diversity and inclusion as fundamental to the
company's mission.

Attracting and Developing Talent. Attracting and developing high-performing
talent is essential to AbbVie's continued success. AbbVie implements detailed
talent attraction strategies, with an emphasis on STEM skill sets, a diverse
talent base and other critical skillsets, including drug discovery, clinical
development, market access and business development. AbbVie has also invested
in integrated inclusive practices across the end-to-end hiring process and
introduced Inclusive Recruitment Live Trainings, as a requirement for all
people leaders and recruiters. AbbVie also invests in competitive compensation
and benefits programs. In addition to offering a comprehensive suite of
benefits ranging from medical and dental coverage to retirement, disability
and life insurance programs, AbbVie also provides health promotion programs,
mental health awareness campaigns and employee assistance programs in several
countries, financial wellness support, on-site health screenings and
immunizations in several countries and on-site fitness and rehabilitation
centers. In 2022, AbbVie launched on-site health care clinics at certain
locations, offering convenient and affordable access to quality healthcare,
flu shots and vaccines. In addition, the AbbVie Employee Assistance Fund (a
part of the AbbVie Foundation) supports two programs for global employees: the
AbbVie Possibilities Scholarship for children of employees, which is an annual
merit-based scholarship for use at accredited colleges, universities or
vocational-technical schools; and the Employee Relief Program, which is
financial assistance to support short term needs of employees when faced with
large-scale disasters (e.g. a hurricane), individual disasters (e.g. a home
fire) or financial hardship (e.g. the death of a spouse). Finally, AbbVie
empowers managers and their teams with tools, tips and guidelines on
effectively managing workloads, managing teams from a distance and supporting
flexible work practices. In 2022, we implemented "Where We Work", AbbVie's
hybrid work model, offering eligible employees predictable flexibility.

New AbbVie employees are given a tailored onboarding experience for faster
integration and to support performance. One of AbbVie's mentorship programs
allows employees to self-nominate as mentors or mentees and facilitates
meaningful relationships supporting employees' career and development goals.

AbbVie also provides structured, broad-based development opportunities,
focusing on high-performance skills and leadership training. AbbVie's talent
philosophy holds leaders accountable for building a high-performing
organization, and the company provides development opportunities for all
levels of leadership. AbbVie's Learn, Develop, Perform program offers year-
long, self-directed leadership education, supplemented with tools and
resources, and leverages leaders as role models and teachers. In addition, a
foundational success factor to AbbVie's leadership pipeline is the company's
Professional Development Programs, which attract graduates, postgraduates and
post-doctoral talent to participate in formal development programs lasting up
to three years, with the objective of strengthening functional and leadership
capabilities.

Culture. AbbVie's shared values of transforming lives, acting with integrity,
driving innovation, embracing diversity and inclusion and serving the
community form the core of the company's culture. AbbVie articulates the
behaviors associated with these values in the Ways We Work, a core set of
working behaviors that emphasize how the company achieves results is equally
as important as achieving them. The Ways We Work are designed to ensure that
every AbbVie employee is aware of the company's cultural expectations. AbbVie
integrates the Ways We Work into all talent processes, forming the basis for
assessing performance, prioritizing development and ultimately rewarding
employees. AbbVie believes its culture creates strong engagement, which is
measured regularly through a confidential, third-party all-employee survey,
and this engagement supports AbbVie's mission of making a remarkable impact on
people's lives.

Equity, Equality, Diversity & Inclusion (EED&I). A cornerstone of AbbVie's
human capital management approach is to prioritize fostering an inclusive and
diverse workforce. Recently, AbbVie adopted a five-year Equality, Diversity &
Inclusion roadmap that defines key global focus areas, objectives and
associated initiatives, and includes implementation plans organized by
business function and geography. AbbVie's senior leaders have adopted formal
goals aligned with executing this strategy. In recent years, AbbVie's board of
directors has prioritized oversight of AbbVie's response to the U.S. racial
justice movement, including overseeing internal programs designed to ensure
that AbbVie is attracting, retaining and developing diverse talent. Through
December 2022, women represented 52 percent of management positions globally
and in the United States, 37 percent of AbbVie's workforce was comprised of
members of historically underrepresented populations, an increase from 2021.
Further, AbbVie is committed to pay equity and conducts pay equity analyses
annually. A critical component of AbbVie's strategy is to instill an inclusive
mindset in all AbbVie leaders and employees, so the company continues to
realize the full value of its diverse workforce from recruitment through
retirement. AbbVie's Employee Resource Groups also help the company nurture an
inclusive culture by building community and creating connections and
opportunities for mentoring, professional development, talent attraction and
networking. In 2021, AbbVie reiterated its commitment to racial equality and
social justice by, among other things, expanding its employee matching program
to $3-to-$1 for donations to civil rights nonprofits fostering racial equity
and by reaffirming its commitment to clinical trial diversity. Additional
information about AbbVie's efforts on racial equality and social justice is
provided on the company's website at: https://abbvie.com/our-company/equality-
inclusion-diversity/our-commitment-to-racial-justice.html.

these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business,
results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In such case, the
trading price of AbbVie's common stock could decline.

Risks Related to AbbVie's Business

The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses, including the loss
of exclusivity for Humira and increased competition from biosimilars, may
adversely affect AbbVie's revenues and operating earnings.

AbbVie relies on patent, trademark and other intellectual property protection
in the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of its products. In
particular, patent protection is, in the aggregate, important in AbbVie's
marketing of pharmaceutical products in the United States and most major
markets outside of the United States. Patents covering AbbVie products
normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the profitability
of many of AbbVie's products.

As patents for certain of its products expire, AbbVie could face competition
from lower priced generic or biosimilar products. The expiration or loss of
patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes
that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of
time. If AbbVie's competitive position is compromised because of generics,
biosimilars or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's
business and results of operations. In addition, proposals emerge from time to
time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of
generic drugs or biosimilars. Any such proposals that are enacted into law
could increase the impact of generic competition.

Large pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers of pharmaceutical
products continue to expand into the biotechnology field and form partnerships
to pursue biosimilars. Companies have developed and are developing biosimilars
that compete with AbbVie's biologic products, including Humira. As competitors
obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing AbbVie's biologic
products, AbbVie's products may become subject to competition from such
biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences.
Expiration of or successful challenges to AbbVie's applicable patent rights
could also trigger competition from other products, assuming any relevant
exclusivity period has expired. As a result, AbbVie could face increased
litigation and administrative proceedings with respect to the validity and/or
scope of patents relating to its biologic products.

For example, Humira accounted for approximately 37% of AbbVie's total net
revenues in 2022. Humira is facing competition from biosimilar products in the
United States beginning in 2023 due to the loss of exclusivity, which AbbVie
anticipates will cause a significant decline in Humira's revenue and could
adversely affect AbbVie's revenues and operating earnings.

AbbVie's principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in
Item 1, "Business--Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory
Exclusivity" and Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations--Results of Operations," and litigation
regarding these patents is described in Item 3, "Legal Proceedings."

AbbVie's major products could lose patent protection earlier than expected,
which could adversely affect AbbVie's revenues and operating earnings.

A significant portion of AbbVie's revenue and operating earnings are derived
from several major products. Third parties or government authorities may
challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent AbbVie's patents and patent
applications. For example, manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products
file, and may continue to file, Abbreviated New Drug Applications with the FDA
seeking to market generic forms of AbbVie's products prior to the expiration
of relevant patents owned or licensed by AbbVie by asserting that the patents
are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. In addition, petitioners have
filed, and may continue to file, challenges to the validity of AbbVie's
patents under the 2011 Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which created inter
partes review and post grant review procedures for challenging patent validity
in administrative proceedings at the United States Patent and Trademark
Office.

Although most of the challenges to AbbVie's intellectual property have come
from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property
rights. For example, court decisions and potential legislation relating to
patents, such as legislation regarding biosimilars, and other regulatory
initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection.
In addition, certain governments outside the United States have indicated that
compulsory licenses to patents may be sought to further their domestic
policies or on the basis of national emergencies, such as HIV/AIDS. If
triggered, compulsory licenses may diminish or eliminate sales and profits
from those jurisdictions and negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations.

AbbVie normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents,
including by filing patent infringement lawsuits. Patent litigation,
administrative proceedings and other challenges to AbbVie's patents are costly
and unpredictable and may deprive AbbVie of market exclusivity for a patented
product. To the extent AbbVie's intellectual property is

* * *

successfully challenged, circumvented or weakened, or to the extent such
intellectual property does not allow AbbVie to compete effectively, AbbVie's
business will suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce AbbVie's
intellectual property rights or require compulsory licensing of AbbVie's
intellectual property, AbbVie's revenues and operating earnings will be
reduced.

A third party's intellectual property may prevent AbbVie from selling its
products or have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and
financial condition.

Third parties may claim that an AbbVie product infringes upon their
intellectual property. In addition, in its pursuit of valid business
opportunities, AbbVie may be required to challenge intellectual property
rights held by others that it believes were improperly granted. Resolving an
intellectual property infringement or other claim can be costly and time
consuming and may require AbbVie to enter into license agreements. AbbVie
cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on
commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other
intellectual property infringement could subject AbbVie to significant damages
or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale, or use of the affected
AbbVie product or products. Any of these events could have a material adverse
effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition.

AbbVie's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing and
marketing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause
its revenues and profitability to decline.

To remain competitive, AbbVie must continue to launch new products and new
indications and/or brand extensions for existing products. Such launches must
generate revenue sufficient both to cover its substantial research and
development costs and to replace revenues of profitable products that are lost
to or displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so would
have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenue and profitability.
Accordingly, AbbVie commits substantial effort, funds and other resources to
research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures
without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. A high
rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research
and development of new products, and failure can occur at any point in the
research and development process, including after significant funds have been
invested. Products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the
market for numerous reasons, including failure to demonstrate effectiveness,
safety concerns, superior safety or efficacy of competing therapies, failure
to achieve positive clinical or pre-clinical outcomes beyond the current
standards of care, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or
delays in the approval of new products and new indications, limited scope of
approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture or the failure to obtain or
maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual
property rights of others.

Decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a
pharmaceutical product candidate can affect the marketing strategy once such
candidate receives approval. More detailed studies may demonstrate additional
benefits that can help in the marketing, but they also consume time and
resources and may delay submitting the pharmaceutical product candidate for
regulatory approval. AbbVie cannot guarantee that a proper balance of speed
and testing will be made with respect to each pharmaceutical product candidate
or that decisions in this area would not adversely affect AbbVie's results of
operations.

Even if AbbVie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements
to its existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing
clinical preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors'
innovations. AbbVie's innovations may not be accepted quickly in the
marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over third-
party reimbursement. AbbVie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of
its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to
develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any
products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new
products or new indications for existing products may cause AbbVie's products
to become obsolete, causing AbbVie's revenues and operating results to suffer.

AbbVie is subject to cost-containment efforts and pricing pressures that could
cause a reduction in revenues and operating earnings, and changes in the terms
of rebate and chargeback programs, which are common in the pharmaceuticals
industry, could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations.

Cost-containment efforts by governments and private organizations are
described in greater detail in Item 1, "Business--Regulation--
Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing." To the extent these cost
containment efforts are not offset by greater demand, increased patient access
to health care, or other factors, AbbVie's revenues and operating earnings
will be reduced. In the United States, the European Union and other countries,
AbbVie's business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing, and
this pressure could increase in the future.

AbbVie is subject to increasing public and legislative pressure with respect
to pharmaceutical pricing. In the United States, practices of managed care
groups, and institutional and governmental purchasers, as well as federal laws
and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, contribute to pricing
pressures. In particular, the Inflation Reduction Act of

* * *

2022 requires (i) the government to negotiate prices for select high
expenditure Medicare Part D drugs (prices effective beginning in 2026) and
Part B drugs (prices effective beginning in 2028), (ii) manufacturers to pay a
rebate for Medicare Part B and Part D drugs when prices for those drugs
increase faster than inflation beginning in 2022 for Part D and 2023 for Part
B, and (iii) a Medicare Part D redesign replacing the current coverage gap
provisions and establishing a $2,000 cap for out-of-pocket costs for Medicare
beneficiaries beginning in 2025, with manufacturers being responsible for 10%
of costs up to the $2,000 cap and 20% after that cap is reached. The Inflation
Reduction Act is to be implemented through forthcoming agency action, the
outcome of which cannot be reasonably determined with certainty. Additionally,
changes to U.S. tax laws now require (i) a 15% minimum tax generally applied
to U.S. corporations on adjusted financial statement income beginning in 2023
and (ii) a non-deductible 1% excise tax provision on net stock repurchases, to
be applied to repurchases beginning in 2023. AbbVie continues to evaluate the
impact that the Inflation Reduction Act may have on the company. The potential
for continuing changes to the health care system in the United States and the
increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare,
Medicaid and private sector beneficiaries may result in additional pricing
pressures.

In major markets worldwide, governments play a significant role in funding
health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of
pharmaceutical products. Consequently, in those markets, AbbVie is subject to
government decision-making and budgetary actions with respect to its products.
In particular, many European countries have ongoing government-mandated price
reductions for many pharmaceutical products, and AbbVie anticipates continuing
pricing pressures in Europe. Differences between countries' pricing
regulations could lead to third-party cross-border trading in AbbVie's
products that results in a reduction in revenues and operating earnings.

Rebates related to government programs, such as fee-for-service Medicaid or
Medicaid managed care programs, arise from laws and regulations. AbbVie cannot
predict with certainty if additional government initiatives to contain health
care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory
requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts. Other
rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private
payers. Various factors, including market factors and the ability of private
payers to control patient access to products, may provide payers the leverage
to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a
material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations.

A portion of AbbVie's near-term pharmaceutical pipeline relies on
collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development
and sale of its products.

AbbVie depends on alliances and joint ventures with pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies for a portion of the products in its near-term
pharmaceutical pipeline. Failures by these parties to meet their contractual,
regulatory, or other obligations to AbbVie, or any disruption in the
relationships between AbbVie and these third parties, could have an adverse
effect on AbbVie's pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, AbbVie's
collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years
and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and
revenues of AbbVie and its collaboration partners, including the ownership of
intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. This could result
in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the
development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products, affect the
effective sale and delivery of AbbVie's commercialized products and lead to
lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration.

Biologics carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a negative
impact on AbbVie's business and results of operations.

The successful discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is
a long, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and
uncertainties with biologics. For example, access to and supply of necessary
biological materials, such as cell lines, may be limited and current
governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use
of such materials. In addition, the development, manufacturing and sale of
biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive
than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. As a result,
manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is often complex and
may require the use of innovative technologies. Such manufacturing also
requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and
sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures. Biologics are
also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived
from living animal or plant material, and some biologics cannot be made
synthetically. Failure to successfully discover, develop, manufacture and sell
biologics--including Humira and Skyrizi --could have a negative impact on
AbbVie's business and results of operations.

New products and technological advances by AbbVie's competitors may negatively
affect AbbVie's results of operations.

AbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies that research, develop, manufacture, market and sell proprietary
pharmaceutical products and biologics. For example, Humira competes with anti-

* * *

TNF products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of
disease states and Mavyret/Maviret competes with other available hepatitis C
treatment options. In addition, in the past few years, a number of other
companies have started to develop, have successfully developed and/or are
currently marketing products that are being positioned as competitors to
Botox. All of these competitors may introduce new products or develop
technological advances that compete with AbbVie's products in therapeutic
areas such as immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and
eye care. In addition, as AbbVie products lose exclusivity, competition
surrounding such products will increase and generic and biosimilar products
will increasingly penetrate the markets. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty
the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or
technological advances. Such competing products may be safer, more effective,
more effectively marketed or sold, have lower prices or better insurance
coverage or reimbursement levels, or have superior performance features than
AbbVie's products, and this may negatively impact AbbVie's business and
results of operations.

The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex
process, and if AbbVie or one of its suppliers encounters problems
manufacturing AbbVie's products, AbbVie's business could suffer.

The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex
process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise
during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment
malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems
with raw materials, delays related to the construction of new facilities or
the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support
future demand for AbbVie's products, changes in manufacturing production sites
and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes
in the types of products produced, physical limitations that could inhibit
continuous supply, man-made or natural disasters and environmental factors. If
problems arise during the production of a batch of product, such batch of
product may have to be discarded and AbbVie may experience product shortages
or incur added expenses. This could, among other things, lead to increased
costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent
investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with
respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before
the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may
also be incurred.

AbbVie uses raw materials and components in its pharmaceutical and biologic
manufacturing processes, including those sourced from single suppliers, and an
interruption in the supply of those raw materials and components could
adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations.

AbbVie uses raw materials and components in its pharmaceutical and biologic
manufacturing processes that may be sourced from single suppliers. The failure
of AbbVie's suppliers, and particularly its single-source suppliers, to
fulfill their contractual obligations in a timely manner or as a result of
regulatory noncompliance or physical disruption at a manufacturing site may
impair AbbVie's ability to deliver its products to customers on a timely and
competitive basis, which could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results
of operations. Increases in demand on any of AbbVie's suppliers could result
in delays and disruptions in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of its
products and/or product shortages, leading to lost revenue. Finding an
alternative supplier could take a significant amount of time and involve
significant expense due to the nature of the products and the need to obtain
regulatory approvals. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will be able to reach
agreement with alternative providers or that regulatory authorities would
approve AbbVie's use of such alternatives. Business interruption insurance may
not provide adequate compensation in the case of a failure by a supplier.

Certain aspects of AbbVie's operations are highly dependent upon third party
service providers.

AbbVie relies on suppliers, vendors and other third party service providers to
research, develop, manufacture, commercialize, promote and sell its products.
Reliance on third party manufacturers reduces AbbVie's oversight and control
of the manufacturing process. Some of these third party providers are subject
to legal and regulatory requirements, privacy and security risks and market
risks of their own. The failure of a critical third party service provider to
meet its obligations could have a material adverse impact on AbbVie's
operations and results. If any third party service providers have violated or
are alleged to have violated any laws or regulations during the performance of
their obligations to AbbVie, it is possible that AbbVie could suffer financial
and reputational harm or other negative outcomes, including possible legal
consequences.

Significant safety or efficacy issues could arise for AbbVie's products, which
could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenues and financial
condition.

Pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in
controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval,
these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients.
Additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies may also be conducted, which
may be sponsored by AbbVie but could also be sponsored by competitors,
insurance companies, government institutions, scientists, investigators or
other interested parties. If new safety or efficacy issues are reported or if
new scientific information becomes available (including results of post-
marketing Phase 4 trials), or if governments change standards regarding
safety, efficacy or labeling, AbbVie may be required to amend

the conditions of use for a product. For example, AbbVie may voluntarily
provide or be required to provide updated information on a product's label or
narrow its approved indication, either of which could reduce the product's
market acceptance. If safety or efficacy issues with an AbbVie product arise,
sales of the product could be halted by AbbVie or by regulatory authorities
and regulatory action could be taken by such regulatory authorities. Safety or
efficacy issues affecting suppliers' or competitors' products also may reduce
the market acceptance of similar AbbVie products.

New data about AbbVie's products, or products similar to its products, could
negatively impact demand for AbbVie's products due to actual or perceived
safety issues or uncertainty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could
result in product withdrawal. Furthermore, new data and information, including
information about product misuse, may lead government agencies, professional
societies, practice management groups or organizations involved with various
diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of
AbbVie's products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on
sales. Such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of AbbVie's
products.

AbbVie is subject to product liability claims and other lawsuits that may
adversely affect its business, results of operations and reputation.

In the ordinary course of business, AbbVie is the subject of product liability
claims and lawsuits alleging that AbbVie's current or historical products or
the products of other companies that it promotes have resulted or could result
in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. For example, lawsuits are
pending against Allergan, AbbVie's subsidiary, and certain of its former
officers alleging they made misrepresentations and omissions regarding
Allergan's textured breast implants. Product liability claims and lawsuits and
safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, may
have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations and
reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences
may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the product
in question, lower revenue and exposure to other claims. AbbVie evaluates its
risks and has determined that the cost of obtaining product liability
insurance outweighs the likely benefits of the coverage that is available and,
as such, AbbVie's product liability losses are self-insured.

AbbVie is also the subject of other claims, legal proceedings and
investigations in the ordinary course of business, which relate to
intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters. Adverse
outcomes in such claims, legal proceedings and investigations may also
adversely affect AbbVie's business, results of operations and reputation. For
example, Allergan was named as a defendant in approximately 3,000 matters
relating to the promotion and sale of prescription opioid pain relievers.
Allergan recently agreed to a nationwide settlement to resolve such matters,
which will provide for up to $2.02 billion to help support state and local
efforts to address opioid-related issues in the United States, among other
things. However, AbbVie cannot guarantee that the conditions to such
settlement will be satisfied, or that additional suits will not be filed. See
Note 15, "Legal Proceedings and Contingencies" to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included under Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data." AbbVie cannot predict with certainty the outcome of these proceedings.

AbbVie is subject to governmental regulations, and it can be costly to comply
with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes.

AbbVie's products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous
international, supranational, federal and state authorities, as described in
Item 1, "Business--Regulation--Discovery and Clinical Development," "Business
--Regulation--Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing," and
"Business--Regulation--Medical Devices." The process of obtaining regulatory
approvals to market a pharmaceutical product can be costly and time consuming,
and approvals may not be granted for future products, or additional
indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays
in the receipt of, or failure to obtain approvals for, future products, or new
indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues,
reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs.

  

The U.S. healthcare industry, in particular, is highly regulated and subject
to frequent and substantial regulatory changes. It is expected that the U.S.
healthcare industry will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as
well as political and legal action, as future proposals to reform the
healthcare system are considered by the executive branch, Congress and state
legislatures. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty when additional changes in
the healthcare industry in general, or the pharmaceutical industry in
particular, will occur, or what the impact of such changes may be. For
example, the Inflation Reduction Act is to be implemented through forthcoming
agency action, the outcome of which cannot be reasonably determined with
certainty.

  

In addition, AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will remain compliant with
applicable regulatory requirements once approval has been obtained for a
product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding
manufacturing practices, product labeling and advertising and post-marketing
reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts due to
manufacturing quality concerns. AbbVie must incur expense and spend time and
effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations.

Possible regulatory actions could result in substantial modifications to
AbbVie's business practices and operations; refunds, recalls or seizures of
AbbVie's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of
AbbVie's or its suppliers' facilities while AbbVie or its supplier remedies
the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future approvals; and
withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these
events could disrupt AbbVie's business and have a material adverse effect on
its business and results of operations.

Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new
obligations on AbbVie, require it to change its business practices, and
restrict its operations.

The health care industry is subject to federal, state and international laws
and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursements,
rebates, price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse. In
the United States, these laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws, the
Medicaid Rebate Statute, the Veterans Health Care Act, the U.S. Physician
Payments Sunshine Act, the TRICARE program, the government pricing rules
applicable to the Medicaid, Medicare Part B, 340B Drug Pricing Program and
individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices.
Violations of such laws and regulations may be punishable by criminal and/or
civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment
and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs,
including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs. Such
violations may also lead to product recalls and seizures, interruption of
production leading to product shortages, import bans or denials of import
certifications, delays or denials in the approvals of new products or
supplemental approvals of current products pending resolution of the issues,
and reputational harm, any of which would adversely affect AbbVie's business.
These laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to change and
evolving interpretations, which could require AbbVie to incur substantial
costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or
marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws and regulations, or
allegations of such violations, could impose new obligations on AbbVie,
require it to change its business practices and restrict its operations.

Public health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics, such as the coronavirus
(COVID-19), have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on
AbbVie's operations and financial condition.

Public health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics have had, and could in the
future have, an adverse impact on AbbVie's operations and financial condition.
The pandemic caused by the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) caused many
countries, including the United States, to declare national emergencies and
implement preventive measures such as travel bans and shelter in place or
total lock-down orders. The continuation or re-implementation of these bans
and orders remains uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic caused AbbVie to modify
certain of its business practices, and AbbVie may take further actions as may
be required by government authorities or as AbbVie determines are in the best
interests of AbbVie's employees, patients, customers and business partners.

While the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations, including, among others,
its manufacturing and supply chain, sales and marketing, commercial and
clinical trial operations, to date was not material, AbbVie experienced lower
new patient starts in certain products and markets. The impact of COVID-19 and
other public health outbreaks on AbbVie over the long-term is uncertain and
cannot be predicted with confidence. The extent of the adverse impact of
COVID-19 or any other public health outbreak on AbbVie's operations will
depend on the extent and severity of the continued spread of the disease
globally, the timing and nature of actions taken to respond to it and the
resulting economic consequences. Ultimately, efforts to mitigate the impact of
COVID-19 or any other public health outbreak may not completely prevent
AbbVie's business from being adversely affected and future impacts remain
uncertain.

The international nature of AbbVie's business subjects it to additional
business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline.

AbbVie's business is subject to risks associated with doing business
internationally, including in emerging markets. Net revenues outside of the
United States made up approximately 21% of AbbVie's total net revenues in
2022. The risks associated with AbbVie's operations outside the United States
include:

•fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

•changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs and pricing
restrictions;

•multiple legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change and
that could restrict AbbVie's ability to manufacture, market and sell its
products;

•differing local product preferences and product requirements;

•trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;

•international trade disruptions or disputes;

•difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing operations;

•differing labor regulations;

•potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax
laws;

•political and economic instability, including as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic;

•sovereign debt issues;

•price and currency exchange controls, limitations on participation in local
enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental action and
regulation;

•inflation, recession and fluctuations in interest rates;

•restrictions on transfers of funds;

•potential deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of
certain non-U.S. countries; and

•potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-
corruption, anti-bribery and other similar laws and regulations, including the
United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery
Act.

In particular, in February 2022, armed conflict escalated between Russia and
Ukraine. In response thereto, the United States and other North Atlantic
Treaty Organizations member states, as well as certain non-member states,
announced targeted economic sanctions, embargoes and export controls on Russia
and Belarus. Although AbbVie is continuing to supply essential pharmaceutical
products in Russia for humanitarian reasons while working to maintain
compliance with evolving international sanctions, it has suspended operations
for all aesthetics products in Russia. AbbVie's operations in Russia, Belarus
and Ukraine are not significant. However, it is not possible to predict with
certainty the continued consequences of this conflict, which, in addition to
sanctions, have included regional instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse
effects on macroeconomic conditions, currency exchange rates and financial
markets. Any such consequences could have an adverse impact on AbbVie's
business and results of operations.

If AbbVie does not effectively and profitably commercialize its products,
AbbVie's revenues and financial condition could be adversely affected.

AbbVie must effectively and profitably commercialize its principal products by
creating and meeting continued market demand; achieving market acceptance and
generating product sales; ensuring that the active pharmaceutical
ingredient(s) for a product and the finished product are manufactured in
sufficient quantities and in compliance with requirements of the FDA and
similar foreign regulatory agencies and with acceptable quality and pricing to
meet commercial demand; and ensuring that the entire supply chain efficiently
and consistently delivers AbbVie's products to its customers. The
commercialization of AbbVie products may not be successful due to, among other
things, unexpected challenges from competitors, new safety issues or concerns
being reported that may impact or narrow approved indications, the relative
price of AbbVie's product as compared to alternative treatment options and
changes to a product's label that further restrict its marketing. If the
commercialization of AbbVie's principal products is unsuccessful, AbbVie's
revenues and financial condition could be adversely affected.

AbbVie may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or
products, form alliances, or dispose of assets, which could cause it to incur
significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability.

AbbVie may pursue acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements, joint
ventures and strategic alliances, or dispose of some of its assets, as part of
its business strategy. AbbVie may not complete these transactions in a timely
manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected
benefits. If AbbVie is successful in making an acquisition, the products and
technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require
significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated.
AbbVie may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its
existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or
contingent liabilities. AbbVie could also experience negative effects on its
reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related
charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for
impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of
AbbVie's credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest
expense.

Additionally, changes in AbbVie's structure, operations, revenues, costs, or
efficiency resulting from major transactions such as acquisitions,
divestitures, mergers, alliances, joint ventures, restructurings or other
strategic initiatives, may result in

greater than expected costs, may take longer than expected to complete or
encounter other difficulties, including the need for regulatory approval where
appropriate.

AbbVie is dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products
in the United States and, accordingly, its business and results of operations
could be adversely affected if they encounter financial or other difficulties.

In 2022, three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health,
Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of
AbbVie's pharmaceutical product sales in the United States. If one of its
significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties,
such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with AbbVie,
and AbbVie may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes
it on a timely basis or at all, which could adversely affect AbbVie's business
and results of operations.

AbbVie has debt obligations that could adversely affect its business and its
ability to meet its obligations.

The amount of debt that AbbVie has incurred and intends to incur could have
important consequences to AbbVie and its investors. These consequences
include, among other things, requiring a portion of AbbVie's cash flow from
operations to make interest payments on this debt and reducing the cash flow
available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to
grow AbbVie's business. To the extent AbbVie incurs additional indebtedness or
interest rates increase, these risks could increase further. In addition,
AbbVie's cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the
outstanding debt as it becomes due, and AbbVie may not be able to borrow
money, sell assets, or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all,
to refinance its debt.

AbbVie may need additional financing in the future to meet its capital needs
or to make opportunistic acquisitions, and such financing may not be available
on favorable terms, if at all.

AbbVie may need additional financing in the future to meet its capital needs
or to make opportunistic acquisitions. For example, it may need to increase
its investment in research and development activities. The capital and credit
markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption, which may lead to
uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors, and AbbVie
may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to
it, if at all. If AbbVie loses its investment grade credit rating or adequate
funds are not available on acceptable terms, AbbVie may be unable to fund its
expansion, successfully develop or enhance products, or respond to competitive
pressures, any of which could negatively affect AbbVie's business. If AbbVie
raises additional funds by issuing debt or entering into credit facilities, it
may be subject to limitations on its operations due to restrictive covenants.
Failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect AbbVie's
business.

AbbVie depends on information technology and a failure of, or significant
disruption to, those systems could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's
business.

AbbVie relies on sophisticated software applications and complex information
technology systems to operate its business, which may be vulnerable to
malicious intrusion, random attack, loss of data privacy, disruption,
degradation or breakdown. Data privacy or security breaches by employees or
others may in the future result in the failure of critical business
operations. Such breaches may cause sensitive data, including intellectual
property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to AbbVie, its
patients, customers or business partners, to be exposed to unauthorized
persons or to the public. To date, neither AbbVie's business nor operations
have been materially impacted by such incidents. Although AbbVie has invested
in the protection of its data and information technology and monitors its
systems on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that such efforts will
prevent material breakdowns or breaches in AbbVie's information technology
systems that could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business. Such
adverse consequences could include loss of revenue or the loss of critical or
sensitive information from AbbVie's or third-party providers' databases or IT
systems and could also result in legal, financial, reputational or business
harm to AbbVie and potentially substantial remediation costs. In addition,
while AbbVie maintains cyber insurance, it cannot guarantee that such
insurance will be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or
reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of AbbVie
systems.

AbbVie's balances of intangible assets, including developed product rights and
goodwill acquired, are subject to impairment testing and may result in
impairment charges, which may adversely affect AbbVie's results of operations
and financial condition.

A significant amount of AbbVie's total assets is related to acquired
intangibles and goodwill. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of
AbbVie's developed product rights and other intangible assets was $67.4
billion and the carrying value of AbbVie's goodwill was $32.2 billion.

AbbVie's developed product rights are stated at cost, less accumulated
amortization. AbbVie determines original fair value and amortization periods
for developed product rights based on its assessment of various factors
impacting estimated

* * *

useful lives and cash flows of the acquired products. Significant adverse
changes to any of these factors require AbbVie to perform an impairment test
on the affected asset and, if evidence of impairment exists, require AbbVie to
take an impairment charge with respect to the asset. For assets that are not
impaired, AbbVie may adjust the remaining useful lives. Such a charge could
adversely affect AbbVie's results of operations and financial condition.

AbbVie's other significant intangible assets include in-process research and
development (IPR&D) intangible projects, acquired in recent business
combinations, which are indefinite-lived intangible assets. For IPR&D assets,
the risk of failure is significant, and there can be no certainty that these
assets ultimately will yield successful products. AbbVie's ability to realize
value on these significant investments is often contingent upon, among other
things, regulatory approvals and market conditions. As such, IPR&D assets may
become impaired and/or be written off at some point in the future if the
associated research and development effort is abandoned or is curtailed.

Goodwill and AbbVie's IPR&D intangible assets are tested for impairment
annually, or when events occur, or circumstances change that could potentially
reduce the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset. Impairment
testing compares the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset to
its carrying amount. A goodwill or IPR&D impairment, if any, would be recorded
in operating income and could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's
results of operations and financial condition.

Failure to attract, develop and retain highly qualified personnel could affect
AbbVie's ability to successfully develop and commercialize products.

AbbVie's success is largely dependent on its continued ability to attract,
develop and retain diverse, highly qualified scientific, technical and
management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical research
and development, governmental regulation and commercialization. Competition
for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense and
increasing. AbbVie cannot be sure that it will be able to attract and retain
quality personnel or that the costs of doing so will not materially increase.

The illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit or
unregistered versions of AbbVie products could have a material adverse impact
on its reputation, business and results of operations.

Third parties may illegally obtain, distribute, and sell counterfeit or
illegally diverted from their intended market versions of AbbVie products.
These versions of product would not meet AbbVie's rigorous manufacturing,
testing, distribution and quality standards. A patient who receives a
counterfeit, stolen, or diverted drug may be at risk for a number of dangerous
health consequences. The prevalence of counterfeit/diverted medicines is an
industry-wide issue due to a variety of factors, including the adoption of
e-commerce, which increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, greatly enhancing
consumers' ability to obtain prescriptions and other medical treatments via
the internet in lieu of traditional brick and mortar pharmacies. This can
expose patients to greater risks as the internet is a preferred vehicle for
dangerous counterfeit/diverted product offers and scams because of the
anonymity it affords. AbbVie's reputation and business could suffer harm as a
result of counterfeit or diverted drugs sold under its brand name which may
also result in reduced revenues that could negatively affect our results of
operation.

Other factors can have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and
financial condition.

Many other factors can affect AbbVie's results of operations, cash flows and
financial condition, including:

•changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in
accounting standards, taxation requirements, product marketing application
standards, data privacy laws, particularly in the European Union and the
United States and environmental laws;

•differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and
their actual value, particularly for pension and post-employment benefits,
stock-based compensation, intangibles and goodwill; and for contingent
liabilities such as litigation and contingent consideration, the absence of a
recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual
amount;

•changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials,
commodities and supplies), interest rates, market value of AbbVie's equity
investments and the performance of investments held by it or its employee
benefit trusts;

•changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with
or provide services to AbbVie or its employee benefit trusts;

•environmental liabilities in connection with AbbVie's manufacturing processes
and distribution logistics, including the handling of hazardous materials;

•changes in the ability of third parties that provide information technology,
accounting, human resources, payroll and other outsourced services to AbbVie
to meet their contractual obligations to AbbVie;

•the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving environmental, social and
governance objectives;

•information loss or damage to AbbVie's reputation, brand, image or goodwill
due to increased use of social media platforms;

•business interruptions stemming from natural disasters, such as climate
change, earthquakes, hurricanes, flooding, fires, or efforts taken by third
parties to prevent or mitigate such disasters; and

•changes in business, economic and political conditions, including: war,
political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist
activity and related military action; natural disasters; the cost and
availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes,
strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure
from third-party interest groups.

Risks Related to AbbVie's Common Stock

AbbVie cannot guarantee the timing, amount, or payment of dividends on its
common stock or the repurchase of its common stock.

Although AbbVie expects to pay regular cash dividends, the timing,
declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders will fall
within the discretion of AbbVie's board of directors. The board's decisions
regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as
AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service
obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and
other factors that the board deems relevant. For more information, see Item 5,
"Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer
Purchases of Equity Securities." AbbVie's ability to pay dividends and
repurchase shares under its share repurchase program will depend on its
ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets.
AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future.

An AbbVie stockholder's percentage of ownership in AbbVie may be diluted in
the future.

In the future, a stockholder's percentage ownership in AbbVie may be diluted
because of equity issuances for capital market transactions, equity awards
that AbbVie will be granting to AbbVie's directors, officers and employees,
acquisitions or other purposes. AbbVie's employees have options to purchase
shares of its common stock as a result of conversion of their Abbott stock
options (in whole or in part) to AbbVie stock options. AbbVie anticipates its
compensation committee will grant additional stock options or other stock-
based awards to its employees. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on
AbbVie's earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of
AbbVie's common stock. From time to time, AbbVie will issue additional options
or other stock-based awards to its employees under AbbVie's employee benefits
plans.

In addition, AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation
authorizes AbbVie to issue, without the approval of AbbVie's stockholders, one
or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers,
preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights,
including preferences over AbbVie's common stock respecting dividends and
distributions, as AbbVie's board of directors generally may determine. The
terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the
voting power or reduce the value of AbbVie's common stock. For example, AbbVie
could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of
AbbVie's directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or
the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or
redemption rights or liquidation preferences AbbVie could assign to holders of
preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.

Certain provisions in AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of
incorporation and amended and restated by-laws, and of Delaware law, may
prevent or delay an acquisition of AbbVie, which could decrease the trading
price of AbbVie's common stock.

AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and
restated by-laws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are
intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by
encouraging prospective acquirors to negotiate with AbbVie's board of
directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include,
among others:

•the inability of AbbVie's stockholders to call a special meeting;

•the division of AbbVie's board of directors into three classes of directors,
with each class serving a staggered three-year term;

| | | | | | | | | | |

![abbv-20221231_g2.gif](abbv-20221231_g2.gif) | 2022 Form 10-K

* * *

•a provision that stockholders may only remove directors for cause;

•the ability of AbbVie's directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on
AbbVie's board of directors; and

•the requirement that the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least
80% of AbbVie's voting stock is required to amend certain provisions in
AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and AbbVie's
amended and restated by-laws relating to the number, term and election of
AbbVie's directors, the filling of board vacancies, the calling of special
meetings of stockholders and director and officer indemnification provisions.

In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides
that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated
with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of
a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that
corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional
shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its
affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation's
outstanding voting stock.

AbbVie believes these provisions protect its stockholders from coercive or
otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to
negotiate with AbbVie's board of directors and by providing AbbVie's board of
directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions
are not intended to make the company immune from takeovers. However, these
provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some
stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that AbbVie's board of
directors determines is not in the best interests of AbbVie and AbbVie's
stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to
remove and replace incumbent directors.

AbbVie's corporate offices are located at 1 North Waukegan Road, North

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

Company Overview

AbbVie is a global, diversified research-based biopharmaceutical company
positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has
leadership positions across immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and
eye care. AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to
innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the
world's most complex and serious diseases.

AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers,
distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty
pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers
and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and
devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare
providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products
principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales
directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. Outside the
United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to wholesalers or through
distributors, and depending on the market works through largely centralized
national payers system to agree on reimbursement terms. Certain products are
co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie operates as a single
global business segment and has approximately 50,000 employees.

2022 Financial Results

AbbVie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results,
maximizing the benefits of the Allergan acquisition, advancing and investing
in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong,
sustainable growth business over the long term. The company's financial
performance in 2022 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $58.1
billion, operating earnings of $18.1 billion, diluted earnings per share of
$6.63 and cash flows from operations of $24.9 billion. Worldwide net revenues
increased by 3% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis,
reflecting growth across its immunology, neuroscience and aesthetics
portfolios.

Diluted earnings per share in 2022 was $6.63 and included the following after-
tax costs: (i) $6.4 billion related to the amortization of intangible assets;
(ii) $2.8 billion for the change in fair value of contingent consideration
liabilities; (iii) $2.0 billion for charges related to litigation matters;
(iv) $766 million of acquisition and integration expenses; and (v) $604
million related to intangible asset impairment. These costs were partially
offset by an after-tax gain of $126 million related to the divestiture of
Pylera and a benefit of $26 million related to certain tax items.
Additionally, financial results reflected continued funding to support all
stages of AbbVie's pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie's on-
market brands.

Following the closing of the Allergan acquisition in 2020, AbbVie implemented
an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the
combined organization. As a result of the successful execution of the
integration plan, AbbVie realized $2.5 billion of annual cost synergies in
2022.

To achieve these integration objectives, AbbVie incurred total cumulative
charges of $2.3 billion through 2022. These costs consisted of severance and
employee benefit costs (cash severance, non-cash severance, including
accelerated equity award compensation expense, retention and other termination
benefits) and other integration expenses.

Recent Global Events

Russia/Ukraine

In response to the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the United
States and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states, as well as
certain non-member states, announced targeted economic sanctions and export
controls on Russia and Belarus. These include restrictions on the export and
transfer of products containing certain toxins, including Botox, to Russia and
Belarus. However, AbbVie is not prohibited to continue the sale of essential
pharmaceutical products to help ensure patients receive an uninterrupted
supply of their medicines. In March 2022, AbbVie announced the suspension of
operations for all aesthetics products in Russia. In April 2022, AbbVie also
announced that all profits from the sales of essential medicines in Russia
will be donated to support direct humanitarian relief efforts in Ukraine.
While the company's operations in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine are not
significant, if the conflict escalates and results in broader economic and
political concerns, AbbVie's business could be adversely impacted.

Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)

In response to COVID-19, AbbVie continues to closely manage manufacturing and
supply chain resources around the world to help ensure that patients continue
to receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines. Clinical trial sites
are being monitored locally to protect the safety of study participants, staff
and employees. While the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations to date has
not been material, AbbVie continues to experience lower new patient starts in
certain products and markets. AbbVie expects this matter could continue to
negatively impact its results of operations throughout the duration of the
pandemic.

The extent to which COVID-19 may impact AbbVie's financial condition and
results of operations remains uncertain and is dependent on numerous evolving
factors, including the measures being taken by authorities to mitigate against
the spread of COVID-19, the emergence of new variants and the effectiveness of
vaccines and therapeutics.

2023 Strategic Objectives

AbbVie's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines and products
that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of
tomorrow while achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding
execution. AbbVie intends to execute its strategy and advance its mission in a
number of ways, including: (i) maximizing the benefits of a diversified
revenue base with multiple long-term growth drivers; (ii) leveraging AbbVie's
commercial strength and international infrastructure across therapeutic areas
and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; (iii)
continuing to invest in and expand its pipeline in support of opportunities in
immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care as well as
continued investment in key on-market products; (iv) generating substantial
operating cash flows to support investment in innovative research and
development, and return cash to shareholders via a strong and growing dividend
while also reducing debt. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory
submissions and data readouts from key clinical trials in the next 12 months.

AbbVie expects to achieve its strategic objectives through:

•Skyrizi and Rinvoq revenue growth driven by increasing market share and
indication expansion.

•Advancing our hematologic oncology portfolio by increasing Venclexta market
share and new indications, strong commercial execution of new product launches
and effectively managing market and competitive challenges impacting
Imbruvica.

•Continuing investment in the global expansion of aesthetics and increasing
market penetration of Botox and Juvederm Collection.

•Neuroscience revenue growth driven by Vraylar, Botox Therapeutic, Ubrelvy and
Qulipta.

•Maximizing AbbVie's existing eye care portfolio.

•Effectively managing the impact of Humira biosimilar erosion.

•The favorable impact of pipeline products and indications recently approved
or currently under regulatory review where approval is expected in 2023. These
products are described in greater detail in the section labeled "Research and
Development" included as part of this Item 7.

Research and Development

Research and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie's business as a global
biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie's long-term success depends to a great
extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative products
and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other
biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.

AbbVie's pipeline currently includes over 80 compounds, devices or indications
in development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and
is focused on such important specialties as immunology, oncology, aesthetics,
neuroscience and eye care. Of these programs, approximately 50 are in mid- and
late-stage development.

The following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from mid-
stage development to late-stage development as well as developments in
significant late-stage and registration programs. AbbVie expects multiple mid-
stage programs to transition into late-stage programs in the next 12 months.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net Revenues

The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local
currency net revenues at the prior year's foreign exchange rates. This measure
provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign
currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current periods.
AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at
constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of
change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete
understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate analysis of the
company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from
one period to another.| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

(a)Net revenues include Allergan product revenues after the acquisition
closing date of May 8, 2020.

The following discussion and analysis of AbbVie's net revenues by product is
presented on a constant currency basis.

Global Humira sales increased 4% in 2022 primarily driven by market growth
across therapeutic categories, partially offset by direct biosimilar
competition in international markets. In the United States, Humira sales
increased 7% in 2022 primarily driven by market growth across all indications
and favorable pricing. This increase was partially offset by a lower market
share following the corresponding market share gains of Skyrizi and Rinvoq.
Internationally, Humira revenues decreased 15% in 2022 primarily driven by
direct biosimilar competition. On January 31, 2023, Humira lost exclusivity in
the United States. Following this loss of exclusivity, AbbVie expects direct
biosimilar competition and Humira net revenues to decline in the United
States. AbbVie continues to pursue strategies to maintain broad formulary
access of Humira and manage the impact of biosimilar erosion.

Net revenues for Skyrizi increased 78% in 2022 primarily driven by continued
strong volume and market share uptake since launch as a treatment for plaque
psoriasis as well as market growth. Net revenues were also favorably impacted
by recent regulatory approvals and expansion of Skyrizi for the treatment of
psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease.

Net revenues for Rinvoq increased 58% in 2022 primarily driven by continued
strong volume and market share uptake since launch for the treatment of
moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis as well as market growth. Net revenues
were also favorably impacted by recent regulatory approvals and expansion of
Rinvoq for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, ankylosing
spondylitis, ulcerative colitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis.

Net revenues for Imbruvica represent product revenues in the United States and
collaboration revenues outside of the United States related to AbbVie's 50%
share of Imbruvica profit. AbbVie's global Imbruvica revenues decreased 16% in
2022 as a result of decreased market demand and lower market share in the
United States. The decrease in net revenues was also partially offset by
increased collaboration revenues.

Net revenues for Venclexta increased 16% in 2022 primarily due to continued
expansion of Venclexta for the treatment of patients with CLL and acute
myeloid leukemia.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net
revenues increased in 2022 compared to the prior year primarily due to the
unfavorable impact of litigation reserve charges of $2.5 billion, partially
offset by leverage from revenue growth and increased synergies realized.

R&D expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased in 2022 compared to
2021. R&D expense percentage for 2022 was favorably impacted by increased
scale of the combined company and synergies realized, the purchase of priority
review vouchers from third parties in the prior year as well as lower
integration costs related to the acquisition of Allergan.

Acquired IPR&D and milestones expense represents upfront and subsequent
development milestone payments incurred prior to regulatory approval to
acquire rights to in-process R&D projects through R&D collaborations,
licensing arrangements or other asset acquisitions. Acquired IPR&D and
milestones expense in 2022 included a charge of $130 million related to
acquiring Syndesi Therapeutics SA, charges related to other upfront payments
totaling $315 million and development milestones of $252 million. Acquired
IPR&D and milestones expense in 2021 included a charge of $400 million related
to exercising the company's exclusive right to acquire TeneoOne, a charge of
$370 million related to a collaboration

agreement with REGENXBIO Inc, charges related to other upfront payments
totaling $192 million and development milestones of $162 million. See Note 5
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Other Operating Expense, Net

Other operating expense, net in 2022 included a one-time charge of $229
million related to an asset divested as part of the Allergan acquisition,
partially offset by $172 million of income related to the sale of worldwide
commercial rights of a mature brand Pylera. Other operating expense, net in
2021 included a $500 million charge related to the extension of the Calico
Life Sciences LLC collaboration. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information.

Interest expense in 2022 decreased compared to 2021 primarily due to a lower
average debt balance as a result of deleveraging, partially offset by the
impact of higher interest rates.

Interest income in 2022 increased compared to 2021 primarily due to the impact
of higher interest rates.

Other expense, net included charges related to changes in fair value of
contingent consideration liabilities of $2.8 billion in 2022 and $2.7 billion
in 2021. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by
the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of
success of achieving regulatory/commercial milestones, discount rates, the
estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products and other market-
based factors. In 2022, the change in fair value reflected higher estimated
Skyrizi sales driven by stronger market share uptake and the passage of time,
partially offset by higher discount rates. In 2021, the change in fair value
reflected higher estimated Skyrizi sales driven by stronger market share
uptake, favorable clinical trial results and the passage of time, partially
offset by higher discount rates.

Income Tax Expense

The effective income tax rate was 12% in 2022, 11% in 2021 and negative 36% in
2020. The effective income tax rates differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate
of 21% principally due to the impact of foreign operations which reflects the
impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax
incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, business
development activities and changes in fair value of contingent consideration.
The effective tax rates for these periods also reflected the benefit from U.S.
tax credits principally related to research and development credits, the
orphan drug tax credit and Puerto Rico excise tax credits. The Puerto Rico tax
credits relate to excise tax on certain products manufactured in Puerto Rico.
The tax is levied on gross inventory purchases from entities in Puerto Rico
and is included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of
earnings. The majority of the tax is creditable for U.S. income tax purposes.
In 2022, Puerto Rico enacted Act 52-2002 (the "Puerto Rico Act") allowing for
a transition from a Puerto Rico excise tax levied on gross inventory purchases
to an income-based tax beginning in 2023. The company completed the transition
requirements of the Puerto Rico Act in 2022, resulting in the remeasurement of
certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on income tax rates at which
they are expected to reverse in the future. The net tax benefit from the
remeasurement of deferred taxes related to the Puerto Rico Act was $323
million.

Operating cash flows in 2022 increased from 2021 primarily due to improved
results of operations resulting from revenue growth and lower income tax
payments, partially offset by the timing of working capital. Operating cash
flows also reflected AbbVie's contributions to its defined benefit plans of
$357 million in 2022 and $376 million in 2021.

Investing cash flows in 2022 included payments made for capital expenditures
of $695 million, other acquisitions and investments of $539 million, $255
million cash consideration paid to acquire DJS Antibodies Ltd offset by cash
acquired and net sales and maturities of investments securities totaling $92
million. Investment cash flows in 2021 included $535 million cash
consideration paid to acquire Soliton, Inc. offset by cash acquired, payments
made for other acquisitions and investments of $1.4 billion, capital
expenditures of $787 million and net purchases of investment securities
totaling $21 million.

Financing cash flows in 2022 included repayment of $3.1 billion aggregate
principal amount of the company's 2.9% senior notes, $3.0 billion aggregate
principal amount of the company's 2.3% senior notes, $2.9 billion aggregate
principal amount of the company's 3.45% senior notes, $1.7 billion aggregate
principal amount of the company's 3.25% senior notes, $1.0 billion aggregate
principal amount of the company's 3.2% senior notes and $750 million aggregate
principal amount of the company's floating rate senior notes. Additionally
financing cash flows included repayment of a $2.0 billion floating term loan
due May 2025 and issuance of a new $2.0 billion floating rate term loan as
part of the term loan refinancing in February 2022. Subsequent to December 31,
2022, the company repaid a $1.0 billion floating rate three-year term loan
that was scheduled to mature in May 2023.

Financing cash flows in 2021 included early repayments of $1.8 billion
aggregate principal amount of the company's 2.3% principal notes, $1.2 billion
aggregate principal amount of the company's 5.0% senior notes and €750 million
aggregate principal amount of the company's 0.5% senior Euro notes. Financing
cash flows also included repayment of $750 million aggregate principal amount
of floating rate senior notes, $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of
3.375% senior notes, $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.15% senior
notes and $750 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior
notes at maturity. Additionally, financing cash flows included repayment of a
$1.0 billion floating rate term loan due May 2023 and issuance of a new $1.0
billion floating rate term loan as part of the term loan refinancing in
September 2021.

Financing cash flows also included cash dividend payments of $10.0 billion in
2022 and $9.3 billion in 2021. The increase in cash dividend payments was
primarily driven by an increase of the dividend rate.

The company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie
shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at
management's discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued
at any time. AbbVie repurchased 8 million shares for $1.1 billion in 2022 and
6 million shares for $670 million in 2021. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase
authorization was $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2022. On February 16, 2023,
AbbVie's board of directors authorized a $5.0 billion increase to the existing
stock repurchase authorization.

No commercial paper borrowings were issued during 2022 or 2021 and there were
no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2022 or December
31, 2021. AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial
paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed.

Credit Risk

AbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and
government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie
regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable
balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of
the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance for credit
losses equal to the estimate of future losses over the contractual life of
outstanding accounts receivable. AbbVie may also utilize factoring
arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in
such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total
outstanding receivables.

Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings

Credit Facility

AbbVie currently has a $4.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that
matures in August 2024. This credit facility enables the company to borrow
funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various
covenants. At December 31, 2022, the company was in compliance with all
covenants, and commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant.
No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facility as of December
31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Access to Capital

The company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as
they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations or has the
ability to issue additional debt. The company's ability to generate cash flows
from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable
terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand
for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers,
deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings, or
other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current
time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue
debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on
acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives.

Credit Ratings

In 2022, Moody's Investors Service upgraded AbbVie's senior unsecured long-
term credit rating to Baa1 from Baa2, affirmed its Prime-2 short-term credit
rating and revised its outlook to positive from stable. In addition, Standard
and Poor's Global Ratings revised its outlook to positive from stable and
affirmed its long-term issuer credit rating of BBB+.

Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future
financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company's ability
to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of
scheduled maturities of any of the company's outstanding debt.

Future Cash Requirements

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes AbbVie's estimated material contractual
obligations as of December 31, 2022:| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

Contingent consideration liabilities(b)

| 16,384 | | | 1,469 | | | 14,915 |  
  
(a)Includes estimated future interest payments on long-term debt. Interest
payments on debt are calculated for future periods using forecasted interest
rates in effect at the end of 2022. Projected interest payments include the
related effects of interest rate swap agreements. Certain of these projected
interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating
interest rates or other factors or events. The projected interest payments
only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at December 31, 2022.
See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information regarding the company's debt instruments and Note 11 for
additional information on the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at
December 31, 2022.

(b)Includes contingent consideration liabilities which are recorded at fair
value on the consolidated balance sheet. Potential contingent consideration
payments that exceed the fair value recorded on the consolidated balance sheet
are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Note 11 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these
liabilities.

AbbVie enters into certain unconditional purchase obligations and other
commitments in the normal course of business. There have been no changes to
these commitments that would have a material impact on the company's ability
to meet either short-term or long-term future cash requirements.

Income Taxes

Future income tax cash requirements include a one-time transition tax
liability on a mandatory deemed repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of
foreign subsidiaries resulting from U.S. tax reform enacted in 2017. The one-
time transition tax liability was $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2022 and is
payable in four future annual installments.

Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits totaled $6.5 billion as of December
31, 2022. It is not possible to reliably estimate the timing of the future
cash outflows related to these liabilities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information on these unrecognized tax
benefits.

Quarterly Cash Dividend

On October 28, 2022, AbbVie announced that its board of directors declared an
increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $1.41 per share to $1.48 per
share beginning with the dividend payable on February 15, 2023, to
stockholders of record as of January 13, 2023. This reflects an increase of
approximately 5.0% over the previous quarterly rate. The timing,

declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends by AbbVie in the future is
within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many
factors, including AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital
requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain
of AbbVie's debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory
constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other
factors deemed relevant by its board of directors.

Collaborations, Licensing and Other Arrangements

AbbVie enters into collaborative, licensing and other arrangements with third
parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent
upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, or commercial
milestones. Individually, these arrangements are insignificant in any one
annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered
by these arrangements happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the
aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in
that period. From a business perspective, the payments are viewed as positive
because they signify that the product is successfully moving through
development and is now generating or is more likely to generate future cash
flows from product sales. It is not possible to predict with reasonable
certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for
achievement. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information on these collaboration arrangements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States requires the use of estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses. A summary of the company's
significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. Certain of these policies are considered critical as
these most significantly impact the company's financial condition and results
of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex
judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of
matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may vary from these
estimates.

Revenue Recognition

AbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is
transferred to the company's customers, in an amount that reflects the
consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or
services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-
producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue
primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers
control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the
customer.

Rebates

AbbVie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers, state government
Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans,
wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and
private entities.

Rebate and chargeback accruals are accounted for as variable consideration and
are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is
sold. Provisions for rebates and chargebacks totaled $41.4 billion in 2022,
$33.9 billion in 2021 and $27.0 billion in 2020. Rebate amounts are typically
based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices,
which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, the factors
used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the
identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price
terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which
can be significant.

In order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals, the company uses
both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the
distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type
of rebate. To estimate the rebate percentage or net price, the company tracks
sales by product and by customer or payer. The company evaluates inventory
data reported by wholesalers, available prescription volume information,
product pricing, historical experience and other factors in order to determine
the adequacy of its reserves. AbbVie regularly monitors its reserves and
records adjustments when rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms,
legislative changes, or other significant events indicate that a change in the
reserve is appropriate. Historically, adjustments to rebate accruals have not
been material to net earnings.

Allergan acquisition.

Other Allowances

Other allowances include cash discounts, product returns, sales incentives,
and other adjustments, which are accounted for as variable consideration and
are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product
is sold. Reserves for cash discounts and sales incentives are readily
determinable because the company's experience of payment history is fairly
consistent. Product returns can be reliably estimated based on the company's
historical return experience. Cash discounts totaled $1.8 billion in 2022,
$1.6 billion in 2021 and $1.2 billion in 2020. Allowances other than cash
discounts are not significant.

Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits

AbbVie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the
obligations and costs under the pension and other post-employment benefit
plans that are direct obligations of AbbVie. The valuation of the funded
status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using
actuarial assumptions. The significant assumptions, which are reviewed
annually, include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on
plan assets and the health care cost trend rates and are disclosed in Note 12
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The discount rate is selected based on current market rates on high-quality,
fixed-income investments at December 31 each year. AbbVie employs a yield-
curve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists. The yield
curve is developed using high-quality bonds. The yield-curve approach reflects
the plans' specific cash flows (i.e. duration) in calculating the benefit
obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the
yield curve. AbbVie reflects the plans' specific cash flows and applies them
to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in
calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense. For other
countries, AbbVie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and
government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate.

AbbVie's assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts
reported for defined benefit pension and other post-employment plans as of
December 31, 2022. A 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would
have had the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit
costs in 2023 and projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2022:| | |
| | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| 50 basis point

Projected benefit obligation| (612)| | | 687 |  
Other post-employment plans| | |  
Net periodic benefit cost| $| (5)| | | $| 6 |  
Projected benefit obligation| (44)| | | 49 |  
  
The expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation,
historical performance and the current view of expected future returns. AbbVie
considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market
influences. The current long-term rate of return on plan assets for each plan
is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target
asset allocation. AbbVie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a
significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans
as of December 31, 2022 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic
benefit cost in 2023. A one percentage point change in assumed expected long-
term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period
benefit cost of these plans in 2023 by $98 million.

The health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and
current views on projected future health care cost increases. The current
health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of
each plan. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on
the amounts reported for health care plans as of December 31, 2022 and will be
used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2023.

Income Taxes

AbbVie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method.
Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on
reported pre-tax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are
provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary
differences, which are the differences between the financial statement
carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and
the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or
maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely
than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

Litigation

The company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal
proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual
property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal
course of business. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable
losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot
be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is
recorded. Accordingly, AbbVie is often initially unable to develop a best
estimate of loss and therefore, the minimum amount, which could be zero, is
recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is
increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be
made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best
estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an
expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected.

Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets

AbbVie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets
in connection with business combinations that AbbVie records at fair value.
Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur between
companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on
a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. The
discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of
future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market
participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the
intangible asset. In-process research and development (IPR&D) acquired in a
business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset
until regulatory approval is obtained, at which time it is accounted for as a

future use. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval
are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life.

AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may
not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are
reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in
an impairment. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.

Annually, the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing
qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the
fair value is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in
the assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific
to the industry and market, cost factors, the overall financial performance
and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price.
If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the
reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment
test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for
impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is
more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If
the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed.

For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future
cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future
volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the
selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other
assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent
with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of
alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease projected
cash flows and the estimated fair value of the related intangible assets.
Future changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material impact
on the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the
company's estimates.

Contingent Consideration

The fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are
determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable
inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of
achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the
estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. Contingent
consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent
reporting date until the related contingency is resolved. The potential
contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-
weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte
Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then
discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent
consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of
inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the
milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future
sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of
certain of these inputs, which are disclosed in Note 11 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. Changes to the inputs described above could have a
material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations
in any given period.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK| |  
---|---|---  
  
The company is exposed to risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could
be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Certain derivative instruments are used when available on a cost-effective
basis to hedge the company's underlying economic exposures. See Note 11 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the
company's financial instruments and hedging strategies.

Foreign Currency Risk

AbbVie's primary net foreign currency exposures are the Euro, Japanese yen,
Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan and British pound. The following table reflects
the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at December
31, 2022 and 2021:| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| 2022| | 2021  
as of December 31 (in millions)| Contract amount| | Weighted average exchange
rate| | Fair and carrying value receivable/(payable)| | Contract amount| |
Weighted average exchange rate| | Fair and carrying value receivable/(payable)  
Receive primarily U.S. dollars in exchange for the following currencies:| | |
| | | | | | | |  
Euro| $| 8,507 | | | 1.071 | | | $| 9 | | | $| 10,253 | | | 1.155 | | | $| 195
|  
Canadian dollar| 1,302 | | | 1.312 | | | 40 | | | 571 | | | 1.258 | | | 9 |  
British pound| 772 | | | 1.234 | | | (8)| | | 605 | | | 1.331 | | | 9 |  
Chinese yuan| 596 | | | 7.024 | | | (5)| | | 673 | | | 6.400 | | | (1)|  
Japanese yen| 567 | | | 133.3 | | | (3)| | | 602 | | | 113.3 | | | 9 |  
All other currencies| 1,954 | | | n/a| | (2)| | | 1,549 | | | n/a| | 5 |  
Total| $| 13,698 | | | | | $| 31 | | | $| 14,253 | | | | | $| 226 |  
  
The company estimates that a 10% appreciation in the underlying currencies
being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar, with all other
variables held constant, would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange
forward contracts by $1.4 billion at December 31, 2022. If realized, this
appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the
contracts. However, gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses
and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders'
equity volatility relating to foreign exchange. A 10% appreciation is believed
to be a reasonably possible near-term change in foreign currencies.

As of December 31, 2022, the company has €5.9 billion aggregate principal
amount of unsecured senior Euro notes outstanding, which are exposed to
foreign currency risk. The company designated these foreign currency
denominated notes as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign
subsidiaries and affiliates. As a result, any foreign currency translation
gains or losses related to the Euro notes will be included in accumulated
other comprehensive loss. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information regarding the senior Euro notes and Note 11 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the net
investment hedging program.

Interest Rate Risk

The company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points
would adversely impact the fair value of AbbVie's interest rate swap contracts
by approximately $155 million at December 31, 2022. If realized, the fair
value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the
contracts. The company estimates that an increase of 100 basis points in long-
term interest rates would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $4.2
billion at December 31, 2022. A 100 basis point change is believed to be a
reasonably possible near-term change in interest rates.

AbbVie Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1 Background | |  
---|---|---  
  
Background

The principal business of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) is the
discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of a broad line of therapies
that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie's
products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors,
government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and
independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public
warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are
also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In
the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally
through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to
retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. Outside the United States,
AbbVie sells products primarily to wholesalers or through distributors, and
depending on the market works through largely centralized national payers
system to agree on reimbursement terms.

AbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013,
AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the
distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100% of the outstanding common
stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders.

On May 8, 2020, AbbVie completed its acquisition of Allergan plc (Allergan).
Refer to Note 5 for additional information regarding this acquisition.

Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies | |  
---|---|---  
  
Use of Estimates

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and necessarily include
amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. Actual results could
differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for rebates,
pension and other post-employment benefits, income taxes, litigation,
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, contingent consideration
liabilities, financial instruments and inventory and accounts receivable
exposures.

Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AbbVie and all
of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained. Controlling
interest is determined by majority ownership interest and the absence of
substantive third-party participating rights or, in the case of variable
interest entities, where AbbVie is determined to be the primary beneficiary.
Investments in companies over which AbbVie has a significant influence but not
a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method with AbbVie's
share of earnings or losses reported in other expense, net in the consolidated
statements of earnings. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.

During 2022, AbbVie revised its classification of development milestone
expense associated with licensing and collaboration arrangements in the
consolidated statements of earnings. Milestone payments incurred prior to
regulatory approval, which were previously included in research and
development (R&D) expense, are now presented as acquired IPR&D and milestones
expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. The reclassification
decreased R&D expense and increased acquired IPR&D and milestones expense by
$162 million in 2021 and $178 million in 2020. The company believes this
presentation assists users of the financial statements to better understand
the total upfront and subsequent development milestone payments incurred to
acquire in-process research and development projects. Prior periods have been
reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Certain other
reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period consolidated
financial statements to the current period presentation.

Revenue Recognition

AbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is
transferred to the company's customers, in an amount that reflects the
consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or
services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-
producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue
primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers
control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the
customer. The company recognizes shipping and handling costs as an

expense in cost of products sold when the company transfers control to the
customer. Payment terms vary depending on the type and location of the
customer, are based on customary commercial terms and are generally less than
one year. AbbVie does not adjust revenue for the effects of a significant
financing component for contracts where AbbVie expects the period between the
transfer of the good or service and collection to be one year or less.

Cash discounts, rebates and chargebacks, sales incentives, product returns and
certain other adjustments are accounted for as variable consideration.
Provisions for variable consideration are based on current pricing, executed
contracts, government pricing legislation and historical data and are provided
for in the period the related revenues are recorded. Rebate amounts are
typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory
prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate,
factors used in the calculation of the accrual include the identification of
the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the
estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be
significant.

In addition to revenue from contracts with customers, the company also
recognizes certain collaboration revenues. See Note 6 for additional
information related to the collaborations with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and
Genentech, Inc. Additionally, see Note 16 for disaggregation of revenue by
product and geography.

Research and Development Expenses

Internal R&D costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by
third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed.

Acquired IPR&D and Milestones Expenses

In an asset acquisition, payments incurred prior to regulatory approval to
acquire rights to in-process R&D projects are expensed as acquired IPR&D and
milestones expense in the consolidated statements of earnings unless the
project has an alternative future use. These costs include upfront and
development milestone payments related to R&D collaborations, licensing
arrangements, or other asset acquisitions that provide rights to develop,
manufacture and/or sell pharmaceutical products. Where contingent development
milestone payments are due to third parties, prior to regulatory approval, the
payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved.
Regulatory and commercial milestone payments made to third parties subsequent
to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to
cost of products sold over the remaining useful life of the related product.

Business Combinations

AbbVie utilizes the acquisition method of accounting for business
combinations. This method requires, among other things, that results of
operations of acquired companies are included in AbbVie's results of
operations beginning on the acquisition date and that assets acquired and
liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date.
Any excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value
of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Contingent consideration
liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition
date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration
liabilities are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated
statements of earnings. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final
determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months
from the acquisition date. Legal costs, due diligence costs, business
valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when
incurred.

In a business combination, the fair value of IPR&D projects acquired is
capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until the
underlying project receives regulatory approval, at which point the intangible
asset will be accounted for as a definite-lived intangible asset, or
discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. R&D
costs incurred by the company after the acquisition are expensed to R&D as
incurred.

Collaborations and Other Arrangements

The company enters into collaborative agreements with third parties to develop
and commercialize drug candidates. Collaborative activities may include joint
research and development and commercialization of new products. AbbVie
generally receives certain licensing rights under these arrangements. These
collaborations often require upfront payments and may include additional
milestone, research and development cost sharing, royalty or profit share
payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to
the success of the asset in development and commercialization. Upfront
payments associated with collaborative arrangements and subsequent payments
made to the partner for the achievement of development milestones prior to
regulatory approval are expensed to acquired IPR&D and milestones expense in
the consolidated statements of earnings. Regulatory and commercial milestone
payments made to the partner subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized
as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the estimated
useful life of the related asset. Royalties are expensed to cost of products
sold in the consolidated statements of earnings when incurred.

Advertising

Costs associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in
selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the consolidated
statements of earnings. Advertising expenses were $2.0 billion in 2022, $2.1
billion in 2021 and $1.8 billion in 2020.

Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits

AbbVie records annual expenses relating to its defined benefit pension and
other post-employment benefit plans based on calculations which utilize
various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, rates of return on
assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend
rates. AbbVie reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes
modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends. Actuarial
gains and losses are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
(AOCI), net of tax and are amortized over the remaining service attribution
periods of the employees under the corridor method. Differences between the
expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are
generally amortized to net periodic benefit cost over a five-year period.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on
reported pre-tax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are
provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary
differences, which are the differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and
the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or
maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely
than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

Cash and Equivalents

Cash and equivalents include money market funds and time deposits with
original maturities of three months or less.

Investments

Investments consist primarily of equity securities, held-to-maturity debt
securities, marketable debt securities and time deposits. Investments in
equity securities that have readily determinable fair values are recorded at
fair value. Investments in equity securities that do not have readily
determinable fair values are recorded at cost and are remeasured to fair value
based on certain observable price changes or impairment events as they occur.
Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at cost. Gains or losses on
investments are included in other expense, net in the consolidated statements
of earnings. Investments in marketable debt securities are classified as
available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value with any unrealized holding
gains or losses, net of tax, included in AOCI on the consolidated balance
sheets until realized, at which time the gains or losses are recognized in
earnings.

AbbVie periodically assesses its marketable debt securities for impairment and
credit losses. When a decline in fair value of marketable debt security is due
to credit related factors, an allowance for credit losses is recorded with a
corresponding charge to other expense, net in the consolidated statements of
earnings. When AbbVie determines that a non-credit related impairment has
occurred, the amortized cost basis of the investment, net of allowance for
credit losses, is written down with a charge to other expense, net in the
consolidated statements of earnings and an available-for-sale investment's
unrealized loss is reclassified from AOCI to other expense, net in the
consolidated statements of earnings. Realized gains and losses on sales of
investments are computed using the first-in, first-out method adjusted for any
impairments and credit losses that were recorded in net earnings.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable are stated at amortized cost less allowance for credit
losses. The allowance for credit losses reflects the best estimate of future
losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable and is
determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for
known troubled accounts, other currently available information including
customer financial condition and both current and forecasted economic
conditions.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or
market. Cost includes material and conversion costs. Inventories consisted of
the following:| | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
as of December 31 (in millions)| 2022| | 2021  
Finished goods| $| 1,162 | | | $| 932 |  
Work-in-process| 1,417 | | | 1,193 |  
Raw materials| 1,000 | | | 1,003 |  
Inventories| $| 3,579 | | | $| 3,128 |  
  
Property and Equipment| | | | | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
as of December 31 (in millions)| 2022| | 2021  
Land| $| 286 | | | $| 287 |  
Buildings| 2,737 | | | 2,791 |  
Equipment| 7,107 | | | 6,850 |  
Construction in progress| 856 | | | 799 |  
Property and equipment, gross| 10,986 | | | 10,727 |  
Less accumulated depreciation| (6,051)| | | (5,617)|  
Property and equipment, net| $| 4,935 | | | $| 5,110 |  
  
Depreciation for property and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful life for
buildings ranges from 10 to 50 years. Buildings include leasehold improvements
which are amortized over the lesser of the remainder of the lease term or the
useful life of the leasehold improvement. The estimated useful life for
equipment ranges from 2 to 25 years. Equipment includes certain computer
software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing
or obtaining software for internal use and is amortized over 3 to 10 years.
Depreciation expense was $778 million in 2022, $803 million in 2021 and $666
million in 2020.

Leases

Short-term leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the
balance sheet. For leases commencing or modified in 2019 or later, AbbVie does
not separate lease components from non-lease components.

The company records lease liabilities based on the present value of lease
payments over the lease term. AbbVie generally uses an incremental borrowing
rate to discount its lease liabilities, as the rate implicit in the lease is
typically not readily determinable. Certain lease agreements include renewal
options that are under the company's control. AbbVie includes optional renewal
periods in the lease term only when it is reasonably certain that AbbVie will
exercise its option.

Variable lease payments include payments to lessors for taxes, maintenance,
insurance and other operating costs as well as payments that are adjusted
based on an index or rate. The company's lease agreements do not contain any
significant residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.

Litigation and Contingencies

Loss contingency provisions are recorded when it is probable that a liability
has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated
based on existing information. When a best estimate cannot be made, the
minimum loss contingency amount in a probable range is recorded. Legal fees
are expensed as incurred. AbbVie accrues for product liability claims on an
undiscounted basis. The liabilities are evaluated quarterly and adjusted if
necessary as additional information becomes available. Receivables for
insurance recoveries for product liability claims, if any, are recorded as
assets on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a recovery will be
realized.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair
value using a discounted cash flow model. The discounted cash flow model
requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows,
risk, the cost of capital and terminal values of market participants.
Definite-lived intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives
using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. AbbVie reviews the
recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be
recoverable. AbbVie first compares the projected undiscounted cash flows to be
generated by the asset to its carrying value. If the undiscounted cash

* * *

flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value, the intangible
asset is written down to its fair value. Where cash flows cannot be identified
for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest level for which
cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and
liabilities.

Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but are subject to an
impairment review annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment
exist. An impairment of goodwill could occur if the carrying amount of a
reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit. An impairment
of indefinite-lived intangible assets would occur if the fair value of the
intangible asset is less than the carrying value.

The company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative
factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is
less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than
not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying
amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-
lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors
to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not
that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative
impairment test is performed. For its quantitative impairment tests, the
company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant
judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates,
changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate,
asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and
assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market
participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could
increase or decrease projected cash flows and the estimated fair value of the
related intangible assets. Future changes to these estimates and assumptions
could have a material impact on the company's results of operations. Actual
results may differ from the company's estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation

Foreign subsidiary earnings are translated into U.S. dollars using average
exchange rates. The net assets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into
U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. The U.S. dollar affects that
arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates
are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated
statements of comprehensive income. The net assets of subsidiaries in highly
inflationary economies are remeasured as if the functional currency were the
reporting currency. The remeasurement is recognized in net foreign exchange
loss in the consolidated statements of earnings.

Derivatives

All derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at
fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and are classified as current or
long-term based on the scheduled maturity of the instrument.

For derivatives formally designated as hedges, the company assesses at
inception and quarterly thereafter whether the hedging derivatives are highly
effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged
item. The changes in fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value
hedge and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in
earnings immediately. The effective portions of changes in the fair value of a
derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are reported in AOCI and are
subsequently recognized in earnings consistent with the underlying hedged
item. If it is determined that a derivative is no longer highly effective as a
hedge, the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. If a hedged
forecasted transaction becomes probable of not occurring, any gains or losses
are reclassified from AOCI to earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as
hedges are adjusted to fair value through current earnings.

The company also uses derivative instruments or foreign currency denominated
debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and
affiliates. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are
included in AOCI.

Derivative cash flows, with the exception of net investment hedges, are
principally classified in the operating section of the consolidated statements
of cash flows, consistent with the underlying hedged item. Cash flows related
to net investment hedges are classified in the investing section of the
consolidated statements of cash flows.

Note 4 Earnings Per Share| |  
---|---|---  
  
AbbVie grants certain restricted stock units (RSUs) that are considered to be
participating securities. Due to the presence of participating securities,
AbbVie calculates earnings per share (EPS) using the more dilutive of the
treasury stock or the two-class method. For all periods presented, the two-
class method was more dilutive.

The following table summarizes the impact of the two-class method:| | | | | |

The number of common shares excluded was insignificant for all periods
presented.

Note 5 Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements| |  
---|---|---  
  
Acquisition of DJS Antibodies Ltd

In October 2022, AbbVie entered into an agreement to acquire DJS Antibodies
Ltd (DJS) including its lead program DJS-002 and proprietary HEPTAD platform.
DJS-002 is an LPAR1 antagonist antibody currently in preclinical studies for
the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis and other fibrotic diseases.
HEPTAD platform is a potential novel approach to antibody discovery with
specific capabilities targeting transmembrane protein targets. The aggregate
purchase price of $287 million was comprised of a $255 million upfront cash
payment and $32 million for the acquisition date fair value of contingent
consideration liabilities, for which AbbVie may owe up to $95 million in
future payments upon achievement of certain development milestones. The
transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition
method of accounting. As of the acquisition date, AbbVie acquired $233 million
of intangible assets for in-process research and development, $22 million of
intangible assets for developed product rights and $60 million of deferred tax
liabilities. Other assets and liabilities assumed were insignificant. The
acquisition resulted in the recognition of $92 million of goodwill which is
not deductible for tax purposes.

Acquisition of Soliton, Inc.

In December 2021, AbbVie completed its previously announced acquisition of
Soliton, Inc. (Soliton). Soliton's RESONIC (Rapid Acoustic Pulse device) has
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance for the long-term
improvement in the appearance of cellulite up to one year. The transaction was
accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of
accounting. Total consideration transferred allocated to the purchase price
consisted of cash consideration of $535 million paid to holders of Soliton
common stock, equity-based awards and warrants. As of the transaction date,
AbbVie acquired $407 million of intangible assets for developed product rights
and assumed deferred tax liabilities totaling $63 million. Other assets and
liabilities were insignificant. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of
$177 million of goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes.

Acquisition of Luminera

In October 2020, AbbVie entered into an agreement with Luminera, a privately
held aesthetics company based in Israel, to acquire Luminera's full dermal
filler portfolio and R&D pipeline including HArmonyCa, a dermal filler
intended for facial soft tissue augmentation. The aggregate accounting
purchase price of $186 million was comprised of a $122 million upfront cash
payment and $64 million for the acquisition date fair value of contingent
consideration liabilities, for which AbbVie may owe up to $90 million in
future payments upon achievement of certain commercial milestones. The
agreement was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition
method of accounting. As of the acquisition date, AbbVie acquired $127 million
of intangible assets for in-process research and development and $33 million
of intangible assets for developed product rights. Other assets and
liabilities assumed were insignificant. The acquisition resulted in the
recognition of $12 million of goodwill which is not deductible for tax
purposes.

Acquisition of Allergan

On May 8, 2020, AbbVie completed its acquisition of all outstanding equity
interests in Allergan in a cash and stock transaction. Allergan is a global
pharmaceutical leader focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing
branded pharmaceutical, device, biologic, surgical and regenerative medicine
products for patients around the world. The combination created a diverse
entity with leadership positions across immunology, hematologic oncology,
aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. AbbVie's existing product portfolio and
pipeline is enhanced with numerous Allergan assets and Allergan's product
portfolio benefits from AbbVie's commercial strength, expertise and
international infrastructure. Under the terms of the acquisition, each
ordinary share of Allergan common stock was converted into the right to
receive (i) $120.30 in cash and (ii) 0.8660 of a share of AbbVie common stock.

Total consideration for the acquisition of Allergan is summarized as follows:|

(b)Represents the acquisition date fair value of 286 million shares of AbbVie
common stock issued to Allergan shareholders based on the exchange ratio of
0.8660 AbbVie shares for each outstanding Allergan ordinary share at the May
8, 2020, closing price of $83.96 per share.

(c)Represents the pre-acquisition service portion of the fair value of 11
million AbbVie stock options and 8 million RSUs issued to Allergan equity
award holders.

The acquisition of Allergan has been accounted for as a business combination
using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires,
among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
combination be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The
valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was finalized during the
second quarter of 2021. Measurement period adjustments to the preliminary
purchase price allocation during 2021 included (i) an increase to intangible
assets of $710 million; (ii) an increase to deferred income tax liabilities of
$148 million; (iii) other individually insignificant adjustments for a net
increase to identifiable net assets of $2 million; and (iv) a corresponding
decrease to goodwill of $564 million. The measurement period adjustments
primarily resulted from the completion of the valuation of certain license
agreement intangible assets based on facts and circumstances that existed as
of the acquisition date and did not result from intervening events subsequent
to such date. These adjustments did not have a significant impact on AbbVie's
results of operations in 2021 and would not have had a significant impact on
prior period results if these adjustments had been made as of the acquisition
date.

The following table summarizes the final fair value of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date:| | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
(in millions)|  
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed|  
Cash and equivalents| $| 1,537 |  
Short-term investments| 1,421 |  
Accounts receivable| 2,374 |  
Inventories| 2,340 |  
Prepaid expenses and other current assets| 1,982 |  
Investments| 137 |  
Property and equipment| 2,129 |  
Intangible assets|  
Definite-lived intangible assets| 68,190 |  
In-process research and development| 1,600 |  
Other noncurrent assets| 1,395 |  
Short-term borrowings| (60)|  
Current portion of long-term debt and finance lease obligations| (1,899)|  
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities| (5,852)|  
Long-term debt and finance lease obligations| (18,937)|  
Deferred income taxes| (3,940)|  
Other long-term liabilities| (4,765)|  
|  
Total identifiable net assets| 47,652 |  
Goodwill| 16,432 |  
Total assets acquired and liabilities assumed| $| 64,084 |  
  
The fair value step-up adjustment to inventories of $1.2 billion was amortized
to cost of products sold when the inventory was sold to customers and was
fully amortized as of December 31, 2021.

Intangible assets relate to $68.2 billion of definite-lived intangible assets
and $1.6 billion of IPR&D. The acquired definite-lived intangible assets
consist of developed product rights and license agreements and are being
amortized over a weighted-average estimated useful life of approximately
twelve years using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. The estimated
fair values of identifiable intangible assets were determined using the
"income approach" which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of
the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations of the
cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful life. Some of the
more significant assumptions inherent in the development of these asset
valuations include the estimated net cash flows for each year for each asset
or product, the appropriate discount rate necessary to measure the risk
inherent in each future cash flow stream, the life cycle of each asset, the
potential regulatory and commercial success risk, competitive trends impacting
the asset and each cash flow stream, as well as other factors.

The fair value of long-term debt was determined by quoted market prices as of
the acquisition date and the total purchase price adjustment of $1.3 billion
is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense, net over the lives of
the related debt.

Goodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over
the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising
from the other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and
separately recognized. Specifically, the goodwill recognized from the
acquisition of Allergan represents the value of additional growth platforms
and an expanded revenue base as well as anticipated operational synergies and
cost savings from the creation of a single combined global organization. The
goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

Following the acquisition date, the operating results of Allergan have been
included in the consolidated financial statements. For the period from the
acquisition date through December 31, 2020, net revenues attributable to
Allergan were $10.3 billion and operating losses attributable to Allergan were
$1.1 billion, inclusive of $4.0 billion of intangible asset amortization and
$1.2 billion of inventory fair value step-up amortization.

Acquisition-related expenses, which were comprised primarily of regulatory,
financial advisory and legal fees, totaled $781 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 which were included in SG&A expenses in the consolidated
statements of earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2021, AbbVie recovered
certain acquisition-related regulatory fees totaling $401 million which was
recorded as a reduction to SG&A expenses in the consolidated statement of
earnings for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Pro Forma Financial Information

The following table presents the unaudited pro forma combined results of
AbbVie and Allergan for 2020 as if the acquisition of Allergan had occurred on
January 1, 2019:| | | | | | | |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
years ended December 31 (in millions)| | 2020  
Net revenues| | $| 50,521 |  
Net earnings| | 6,746 |  
  
The unaudited pro forma combined financial information was prepared using the
acquisition method of accounting and was based on the historical financial
information of AbbVie and Allergan. In order to reflect the occurrence of the
acquisition on January 1, 2019 as required, the unaudited pro forma financial
information includes adjustments to reflect incremental amortization expense
to be incurred based on the final fair values of the identifiable intangible
assets acquired; the incremental cost of products sold related to the fair
value adjustments associated with acquisition date inventory; the additional
interest expense associated with the issuance of debt to finance the
acquisition; and the reclassification of acquisition-related costs incurred
during the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2019.
The unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of
what the consolidated results of operations would have been had the
acquisition been completed on January 1, 2019. In addition, the unaudited pro
forma financial information is not a projection of future results of
operations of the combined company nor does it reflect the expected
realization of any synergies or cost savings associated with the acquisition.

Other Licensing & Acquisitions Activity

Cash outflows related to other acquisitions and investments totaled $539
million in 2022, $1.4 billion in 2021 and $1.4 billion in 2020. AbbVie

Definite-Lived Intangible Assets

In September 2022, the company made a strategic decision to reduce ongoing
sales and marketing investment related to Vuity, an on-market product to treat
presbyopia. This strategic decision contributed to a significant decrease in
the estimated future cash flows for the product and represented a triggering
event which required the company to evaluate the underlying definite lived-
intangible asset for impairment. The company utilized a discounted cash flow
analysis to estimate the fair value of the intangible asset resulting in a
full impairment of both the gross and net carrying amount. Based on the
revised cash flows, the company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $770
million to cost of products sold in the consolidated statement of earnings for
the third quarter of 2022.

Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful
lives, which range between 1 to 16 years with an average of 12 years for
developed product rights and 11 years for license agreements. Amortization
expense was $7.7 billion in 2022, $7.7 billion in 2021 and $5.8 billion in
2020 and was included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements
of earnings. The anticipated annual amortization expense for definite-lived
intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2022 is as follows:| | | | | | |

Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

Indefinite-lived intangible assets represent acquired IPR&D associated with
products that have not yet received regulatory approval. Indefinite-lived
intangible assets as of December 31, 2022 primarily relate to the acquisitions
of Allergan and DJS.

The company performs its annual impairment assessment of indefinite-lived
intangible assets in the third quarter, or earlier if impairment indicators
exist.

Allergan Integration Plan

Following the closing of the Allergan acquisition, AbbVie implemented an
integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined
organization and incurred total cumulative charges of $2.3 billion through
2022. These costs consisted of severance and employee benefit costs (cash
severance, non-cash severance, including accelerated equity award compensation
expense, retention and other termination benefits) and other integration
expenses.

The following table summarizes the charges (benefits) associated with the
Allergan acquisition integration plan:| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

Other Restructuring

AbbVie continuously evaluates its operations to identify opportunities to
optimize its manufacturing and R&D operations, commercial infrastructure and
administrative costs and to respond to changes in its business environment. As
a result, AbbVie management periodically approves individual restructuring
plans to achieve these objectives. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, no such plans were
individually significant. Restructuring charges recorded were $241 million in
2022, $59 million in 2021 and $60 million in 2020 and were primarily related
to employee severance and contractual obligations. These charges were recorded
in cost of products sold, R&D expense and SG&A expenses in the consolidated
statements of earnings based on the classification of the affected employees
or operations.

In December 2022, the company entered into an agreement to sublease a portion
of its Madison, New Jersey office space through the end of the original lease
maturity in 2030. As a result of this agreement, the company recognized an
impairment loss on its right-of-use asset of $69 million and wrote-off the
related leasehold improvements of $37 million. These losses were recorded to
SG&A expense in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended
December 31, 2022. The company used a discounted cash flows method to value
the right-of-use asset to determine the impairment amount.

Sublease income and finance lease costs were insignificant in 2022, 2021 and
2020.

existing $1.0 billion term loan due May 2023 and borrowed $1.0 billion under a
new term loan at a lower floating rate. All other significant terms of the
loan, including the maturity date, remained unchanged after the refinancing.

Short-Term Borrowings

There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2022
and December 31, 2021. No commercial paper borrowings were issued during 2022
or 2021. There were commercial paper borrowings issued during 2020 and the
weighted-average interest rate was 1.8%. AbbVie currently has a $4.0 billion
five-year revolving credit facility that matures in August 2024. This credit
facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable
interest rates and contains various covenants, all of which the company was in
compliance with as of December 31, 2022. Commitment fees under AbbVie's
revolving credit facilities were insignificant in 2022, 2021 and 2020. No
amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facilities as of December
31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Contingencies and Guarantees

In connection with the separation, AbbVie has indemnified Abbott for all
liabilities resulting from the operation of AbbVie's business other than
income tax liabilities with respect to periods prior to the distribution date
and other liabilities as agreed to by AbbVie and Abbott. AbbVie has no
material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements and no special-purpose
entities. In the ordinary course of business, AbbVie has periodically entered
into third-party agreements, such as the assignment of product rights, which
have resulted in AbbVie becoming secondarily liable for obligations for which
AbbVie had previously been primarily liable. Based upon past experience, the
likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote.

Note 11 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures| |  
---|---|---  
  
Risk Management Policy

The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate
risks related to its business operations. AbbVie's hedging policy attempts to
manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the company's judgment of
the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and costs. The company
uses derivative and nonderivative instruments to reduce its exposure to
foreign currency exchange rates. AbbVie also periodically enters into interest
rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals,
the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by
reference to an agreed-upon notional amount. Derivative instruments are not
used for trading purposes or to manage exposure to changes in interest rates
for investment securities, and none of the company's outstanding derivative
instruments contain credit risk related contingent features; collateral is
generally not required.

Financial Instruments

Various AbbVie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward
exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates
for anticipated intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than
the functional currency of the local entity. These contracts, with notional
amounts totaling $1.7 billion at December 31, 2022 and $1.1 billion at
December 31, 2021, are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair
value. The durations of these forward exchange contracts were generally less
than 18 months. Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2022 will be
reclassified from AOCI and included in cost of products sold at the time the
products are sold, generally not exceeding six months from the date of
settlement.

In 2019, the company entered into treasury rate lock agreements with notional
amounts totaling $10.0 billion to hedge exposure to variability in future cash
flows resulting from changes in interest rates related to the issuance of
long-term debt in connection with the acquisition of Allergan. The treasury
rate lock agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and recorded at fair
value. The agreements were net settled upon issuance of the senior notes in
2019 and the resulting net gain was recognized in other comprehensive income.
This gain is reclassified to interest expense, net over the term of the
related debt.

The company was a party to interest rate swap contracts designated as cash
flow hedges that matured in November 2022, for which the notional amount was
$750 million at December 31, 2021. The effect of the hedge contracts was to
change a floating-rate interest obligation to a fixed rate for that portion of
the floating-rate debt. Realized and unrealized gains or losses were included
in AOCI and were reclassified to interest expense, net over the lives of the
floating-rate debt.

The company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to
manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and
receivables and intercompany loans. These contracts are not designated as
hedges and are recorded at fair value. Resulting gains or losses are reflected
in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of earnings and
are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being
managed. These contracts had notional amounts totaling $6.5 billion at
December 31, 2022 and $8.2 billion at December 31, 2021.

The company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts or foreign
currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign
subsidiaries and affiliates. The company had an aggregate principal amount of
senior Euro notes designated as net investment hedges of €5.9 billion at
December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. In addition, the company had foreign
currency forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges with
notional amounts totaling €4.3 billion, SEK2.0 billion, CAD750 million and
CHF90 million at December 31, 2022 and €4.3 billion at December 31, 2021. The
company uses the spot method of assessing hedge effectiveness for derivative
instruments designated as net investment hedges. Realized and unrealized gains
and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI and the initial fair value
of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is
recognized in interest expense, net over the life of the hedging instrument.

The company is a party to interest rate swap contracts designated as fair
value hedges with notional amounts totaling $4.5 billion at December 31, 2022
and December 31, 2021. The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a fixed-
rate interest obligation to a floating rate for that portion of the debt.
AbbVie records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of
the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount.

No amounts are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for cash flow
hedges or fair value hedges.

Assuming market rates remain constant through contract maturities, the company
expects to reclassify pre-tax gains of $86 million into cost of products sold
for foreign currency cash flow hedges and pre-tax gains of $24 million into
interest expense, net for treasury rate lock agreement cash flow hedges during
the next 12 months.

Related to AbbVie's non-derivative, foreign currency denominated debt
designated as net investment hedges, the company recognized in other
comprehensive income pre-tax gains of $406 million in 2022, pre-tax gains of
$577 million in 2021 and pre-tax losses of $907 million in 2020.

Fair Value Measures

The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:

•Level 1--Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets that the company has the ability to access;

•Level 2--Valuations based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active
markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that
are not active and model-based valuations in which all significant inputs are
observable in the market; and

•Level 3--Valuations using significant inputs that are unobservable in the
market and include the use of judgment by the company's management about the
assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

Money market funds and time deposits are valued using relevant observable
market inputs including quoted prices for similar assets and interest rate
curves. Equity securities primarily consist of investments for which the fair
values were determined by using the published market prices per unit
multiplied by the number of units held, without consideration of transaction
costs. The derivatives entered into by the company were valued using
observable market inputs including published interest rate curves and both
forward and spot prices for foreign currencies.

The fair value measurements of the contingent consideration liabilities were
determined based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount
rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development,
regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales
of the acquired products. The potential contingent consideration payments are
estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for
contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for
contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value.
Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can
result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates,
the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve
the milestones

and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining
the appropriateness of certain of these inputs. Changes to the inputs
described above could have a material impact on the company's financial
position and results of operations in any given period.

The fair value of the company's contingent consideration liabilities was
calculated using the following significant unobservable inputs:| | | | | | | |

assumed in the Allergan and Luminera acquisitions (see Note 5).

The change in fair value recognized in net earnings is recorded in other
expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings and included charges
of $2.8 billion in 2022, $2.7 billion in 2021 and $5.8 billion in 2020. In
2022, the change in fair value reflected higher estimated Skyrizi sales driven
by stronger market share uptake and the passage of time, partially offset by
higher discount rates. In 2021, the change in fair value reflected higher
estimated Skyrizi sales driven by stronger market share uptake, favorable
clinical trial results and the passage of time, partially offset by higher
discount rates. In 2020, the change in fair value reflected higher estimated
Skyrizi sales driven by stronger market share uptake, lower discount rates,
the passage of time and favorable clinical trial results.

AbbVie also holds investments in equity securities that do not have readily
determinable fair values. The company records these investments at cost and
remeasures them to fair value based on certain observable price changes or
impairment events as they occur. The carrying amount of these investments was
$129 million as of December 31, 2022 and $149 million as of December 31, 2021.
No significant cumulative upward or downward adjustments have been recorded
for these investments as of December 31, 2022.

Concentrations of Risk

Of total net accounts receivable, three U.S. wholesalers accounted for 82% as
of December 31, 2022 and 75% as of December 31, 2021, and substantially all of
AbbVie's pharmaceutical product net revenues in the United States were to
these three wholesalers.

Humira (adalimumab) is AbbVie's single largest product and accounted for
approximately 37% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2022, 37% in 2021 and 43%
in 2020.

obligations in the table above included $2.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and
$3.2 billion at December 31, 2021.

For plans reflected in the table above, the accumulated benefit obligations
were $7.7 billion at December 31, 2022 and $10.5 billion at December 31, 2021.

The 2022 actuarial gain of $3.7 billion for qualified pension plans and
actuarial gain of $229 million for other post-employment plans were primarily
driven by an increase in the discount rate. The 2021 actuarial gain of $8
million for qualified pension plans and actuarial loss of $10 million for
other post-employment plans were primarily driven by an increase in the
assumed discount rate offset by change in demographic assumptions from 2020.

AbbVie's U.S. pension plan was modified to close the plan to new entrants
effective January 1, 2022. In addition, a change to AbbVie's U.S. retiree
health benefit plan was approved in 2020 and communicated to employees and
retirees in October 2020. Beginning in 2022, Medicare-eligible retirees and
Medicare-eligible dependents choose health care coverage from insurance
providers through a private Medicare exchange. AbbVie will continue to provide
financial support to Medicare-eligible retirees. This change to the U.S.
retiree health benefit plan decreased AbbVie's post-employment benefit
obligation and increased AbbVie's unrecognized prior service credit as of
December 31, 2020 by $397 million.

For the December 31, 2022 post-retirement health care obligations
remeasurement, the company assumed a 6.2% pre-65 (2.0% post-65) annual rate of
increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits. The pre-65
rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5% (1.8% post-65) in 2030 and
remain at that level thereafter. For purposes of measuring the 2022 post-
retirement health care costs, the company assumed a 5.9% pre-65 (2.1% post-65)
annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care
benefits. The pre-65 rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5% (1.8%
post-65) for 2029 and remain at that level thereafter.

(e)Primarily funds having global mandates with the flexibility to allocate
capital broadly across a wide range of asset classes and strategies, including
but not limited to equities, fixed income, commodities, financial futures,
currencies and other securities, with objectives to outperform agreed upon
benchmarks of specific return and volatility targets.

(f)Investments in cash and cash equivalents.

Equities and registered investment companies having quoted prices are valued
at the published market prices. Fixed income securities that are valued using
significant other observable inputs are quoted at prices obtained from
independent financial service industry-recognized vendors. Investments held in
pooled investment funds, common collective trusts or limited partnerships are
valued at the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient to estimate fair
value. The NAV is provided by the fund administrator and is based on the value
of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities.

The investment mix of equity securities, fixed income and other asset
allocation strategies is based upon achieving a desired return, balancing
higher return, more volatile equity securities and lower return, less volatile
fixed income securities. Investment allocations are established for each plan
and are generally made across a range of markets, industry sectors,
capitalization sizes and in the case of fixed income securities, maturities
and credit quality. The 2022 target investment allocation for the AbbVie
Pension Plan was 62.5% in equity securities, 22.5% in fixed income securities
and 15% in asset allocation strategies and other holdings. There are no known
significant concentrations of risk in the plan assets of the AbbVie Pension
Plan or of any other plans.

The expected return on plan assets assumption for each plan is based on
management's expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved
by the underlying investment portfolio. In establishing this assumption,
management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in
which the plans are invested, as well as current economic and capital market
conditions.

Defined Contribution Plan

AbbVie maintains defined contribution savings plans for the benefit of its
eligible employees. The expense recognized for these plans was $474 million in
2022, $267 million in 2021 and $191 million in 2020. AbbVie provides certain
other post-employment benefits, primarily salary continuation arrangements, to
qualifying employees and accrues for the related cost over the service lives
of the employees.

Stock-Based Compensation

In May 2021, stockholders of the company approved the AbbVie Amended and
Restated 2013 Incentive Stock Program (the Amended Plan), which amends and
restates the AbbVie 2013 Incentive Stock Program (2013 ISP). AbbVie grants
stock-based awards to eligible employees pursuant to the Amended Plan, which
provides for several different forms of benefits, including non-qualified
stock options, RSUs and various performance-based awards. Under the Amended
Plan, a total of 144 million shares of AbbVie common stock have been reserved
for issuance as awards to AbbVie employees.

AbbVie measures compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the grant
date fair value of the awards and the estimated number of awards that are
expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at
the time of grant and are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures
differ from those estimates. Compensation cost for stock-based awards is
amortized over the service period, which could be shorter than the vesting
period if an employee is retirement eligible. Retirement eligible employees
generally are those who are age 55 or older and have at least 10 years of
service.

Stock-based compensation expense is principally related to awards issued
pursuant to the 2013 ISP and the Amended Plan and is summarized as follows:| |
| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

After-tax compensation expense| $| 549 | | | $| 566 | | | $| 622 |  
  
Realized excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation totaled
$116 million in 2022, $50 million in 2021 and $34 million in 2020.

Stock Options

Stock options awarded to employees typically have a contractual term of 10
years and generally vest in one-third increments over a three-year period. The
exercise price is equal to at least 100% of the market value on the date of
grant. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes model. The
weighted-average grant-date fair values of stock options granted were $22.83
in 2022, $16.28 in 2021 and $12.14 in 2020.

In connection with the Allergan acquisition, during the second quarter of
2020, AbbVie issued 11.2 million stock options to holders of Allergan options
as a result of the conversion of such options. These options were fair-valued
using a lattice valuation model. Refer to Note 5 for additional information
regarding the Allergan acquisition.

The following table summarizes AbbVie stock option activity in 2022:| | | | |

Exercisable at December 31, 2022| 7,120 | | | $| 84.54 | | | 3.7| | $| 549 |  
  
The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $295 million in 2022, $239
million in 2021 and $186 million in 2020. The total fair value of options
vested during 2022 was $21 million. As of December 31, 2022, $6 million of
unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be
recognized as expense over approximately the next two years.

RSUs and Performance Shares

RSUs awarded to employees other than senior executives and other key employees
generally vest in ratable increments over a three or four-year period.
Recipients of these RSUs are entitled to receive dividend equivalents as
dividends are declared and paid during the RSU vesting period.

The majority of the equity awards AbbVie grants to its senior executives and
other key employees are performance-based. Equity awards granted to senior
executives and other key employees consist of a combination of performance-
vested RSUs and performance shares as well as non-qualified stock options
described above. The performance-vested RSUs have the potential to vest in
one-third increments during a three-year performance period and may be earned
based on AbbVie's return on invested capital (ROIC) performance relative to a
defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life science companies. The
recipient may receive one share of AbbVie common stock for each vested award.

have the potential to vest over a three-year performance period and may be
earned based on AbbVie's EPS achievement and AbbVie's total stockholder return
(TSR) (a market condition) relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical,
biotech and life sciences companies. Dividend equivalents on performance-
vested RSUs and performance shares accrue during the performance period and
are payable at vesting only to the extent that shares are earned.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs and performance shares
generally is determined based on the number of shares/units granted and the
quoted price of AbbVie's common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-
average grant-date fair values of performance shares with a TSR market
condition are determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model.

  

The following table summarizes AbbVie RSU and performance share activity for

Outstanding at December 31, 2022| 13,031 | | | $| 116.84 |  
  
The fair market value of RSUs and performance shares (as applicable) vested
was $1.0 billion in 2022, $718 million in 2021 and $618 million in 2020.

In connection with the Allergan acquisition, during the second quarter of
2020, AbbVie issued 8.2 million RSUs to holders of Allergan equity awards
based on a conversion factor described in the transaction agreement. Refer to
Note 5 for additional information regarding the Allergan acquisition.

As of December 31, 2022, $578 million of unrecognized compensation cost
related to RSUs and performance shares is expected to be recognized as expense
over approximately the next two years.

Cash Dividends

Other comprehensive income for 2022 included pension and post-employment
benefit plan gains of $1.1 billion primarily due actuarial gains driven by
higher discount rates partially offset by losses on plan assets. Other
comprehensive income for 2022 also included foreign currency translation
adjustments totaling losses of $943 million principally due to the impact of
the weakening of the Euro on the translation of the company's Euro-denominated
assets and the offsetting impact of net investment hedging activities totaling
gains of $555 million. Other comprehensive income for 2021 included foreign
currency translation adjustments totaling losses of $1.2 billion principally
due to the impact of the weakening of the Euro on the translation of the
company's Euro-denominated assets and the offsetting impact of net investment
hedging activities totaling gains of $699 million. Other comprehensive income
for 2020 included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling gains of
$1.5 billion principally due to the impact of the strengthening of the Euro on
the translation of the company's Euro-denominated assets and the offsetting
impact of net investment hedging activities totaling losses of $799 million.

The effective income tax rate fluctuates year to year due to the allocation of
the company's taxable earnings among jurisdictions, as well as certain
discrete factors and events in each year, including changes in tax law,
acquisitions and collaborations. The effective income tax rates in 2022, 2021
and 2020 differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the impact of
foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in
locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other
foreign tax jurisdictions, business development activities, changes in enacted
tax rates and laws and related restructuring, tax audits and settlements and
changes in fair value of contingent consideration. The effective tax rates for
these periods also reflected the benefit from U.S. tax credits principally
related to research and development credits, the orphan drug tax credit and
Puerto Rico excise tax credits. The Puerto Rico tax credits relate to excise
tax on certain products manufactured in Puerto Rico. The tax is levied on
gross inventory purchases from entities in Puerto Rico and is included in cost
of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The majority of
the tax is creditable for U.S. income tax purposes.

In 2022, Puerto Rico enacted Act 52-2002 (the Puerto Rico Act) allowing for a
transition from a Puerto Rico excise tax levied on gross inventory purchases
to an income-based tax beginning in 2023. The company completed the transition
requirements of the Puerto Rico Act in 2022, resulting in the remeasurement of
certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on income tax rates at which
they are expected to reverse in the future. The net tax benefit from the
remeasurement of deferred taxes related to the Puerto Rico Act was $323
million.

The 2020 effective income tax rate included the recognition of a net tax
benefit of $1.7 billion related to changes in tax laws and related
restructuring, including certain intra-group transfers of intellectual
property and deferred tax remeasurement.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was signed into law in December 2017,
resulting in significant changes to the U.S. corporate tax system, including a
one-time transition tax on a mandatory deemed repatriation of earnings of
certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously untaxed. The Act also
created a minimum tax on certain foreign sourced earnings. The company's
accounting policy for the minimum tax on foreign sourced earnings is to report
the tax effects on the basis that the minimum tax will be recognized in tax
expense in the year it is incurred as a period expense.

Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities| | | | | | | | | | |

as of December 31 (in millions)| 2022| | 2021  
Deferred tax assets| | |

Total deferred tax liabilities| (4,702)| | | (5,923)|  
Net deferred tax assets (liabilities)| $| 830 | | | $| (735)|  
  
The increase in net deferred tax assets is primarily related to capitalization
of R&D expense and increases in accruals and reserves, offset by a decrease in
advance payments. The decrease in deferred tax liabilities is primarily
related to amortization of intangible assets.

In connection with the Allergan acquisition, the company recorded adjustments
within the measurement period in 2021 related to foreign net operating losses
and other credit carryforwards that are not expected to be realized. The
adjustments reflected an increase of $8.2 billion to deferred tax assets and
an offsetting increase to valuation allowances, resulting in no net impact to
deferred tax assets.

The company had valuation allowances of $9.6 billion as of December 31, 2022
and $9.4 billion as of December 31, 2021. These were principally related to
foreign and state net operating losses and other credit carryforwards that are
not expected to be realized.

As of December 31, 2022, the company had U.S. federal, state and foreign
credit carryforwards of $355 million as well as U.S. federal, state and
foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $33.2 billion, which will expire
at various times through 2042. The remaining U.S. federal and foreign loss
carryforwards of $6.0 billion have no expiration.

The Act significantly changed the timing and manner in which earnings of
foreign subsidiaries are subject to U.S. tax. Therefore, unremitted foreign
earnings subject to the Act's transition tax are not considered indefinitely
reinvested. Post-2017 earnings subject to the U.S. minimum tax on foreign
sourced earnings or eligible for the 100 percent foreign dividends received
deduction are also not considered indefinitely reinvested earnings. However,
the company generally considers instances of outside basis differences in
foreign subsidiaries that would incur additional U.S. tax upon reversal (e.g.,
capital gain distribution) to be permanent in duration. The unrecognized tax
liability is not practicable to determine.

If recognized, the net amount of potential tax benefits that would impact the
company's effective tax rate is $5.5 billion in 2022 and $5.2 billion in 2021.
The "Increase due to current year tax positions" and "Increase due to prior
year tax positions" in the table above include amounts related to federal,
state and international tax items. "Increase due to acquisition" in the table
above includes amounts related to federal, state and international tax items
recorded in acquisition accounting related to the Allergan acquisition.

AbbVie recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in
income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. AbbVie
recognized gross income tax expense of $339 million in 2022, $161 million in
2021 and $142 million in 2020, for interest and penalties related to income
tax matters. AbbVie had an accrual for the payment of gross interest and
penalties of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2022, $803 million at December 31,
2021 and $642 million at December 31, 2020.

The company is routinely audited by the tax authorities in significant
jurisdictions and a number of audits are currently underway. It is reasonably
possible during the next 12 months that uncertain tax positions may be
settled, which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized
tax benefits. Due to the potential for resolution of federal, state and
foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitation, the
company's gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next
12 months up to $162 million. All significant federal, state, local and
international matters have been concluded for years through 2009. The company
believes adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties.

Note 15 Legal Proceedings and Contingencies | |  
---|---|---  
  
AbbVie is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings
and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property,
commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of
business. The most significant matters are described below. Loss contingency
provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a
loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency
amount within a probable range is recorded. For litigation matters discussed
below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the company is
unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, beyond the
amounts accrued. Initiation of new legal proceedings or a change in the status
of existing proceedings may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued
by AbbVie. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all proceedings
and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate
disposition should not have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Subject to certain exceptions specified in the separation agreement by and
between Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) and AbbVie, AbbVie assumed the liability
for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters related to its
business, including liabilities for any claims or legal proceedings related to
products that had been part of its business, but were discontinued prior to
the distribution, as well as assumed or retained liabilities, and will
indemnify Abbott for any liability arising out of or resulting from such
assumed legal matters.

Antitrust Litigation

Lawsuits are pending against AbbVie and others generally alleging that the
2005 patent litigation settlement involving Niaspan entered into between Kos
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company acquired by Abbott in 2006 and presently a
subsidiary of AbbVie) and a generic company violates federal and state
antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust
enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive
relief and attorneys' fees. The lawsuits pending in federal court consist of
four individual plaintiff lawsuits and two consolidated purported class
actions: one brought

by Niaspan direct purchasers and one brought by Niaspan end-payors. The cases
are pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings under the
MDL Rules as In re: Niaspan Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 2460\. In August
2019, the court certified a class of direct purchasers of Niaspan. In June
2020 and August 2021, the court denied the end-payors' motion to certify a
class. In October 2016, the Orange County, California District Attorney's
Office filed a lawsuit on behalf of the State of California regarding the
Niaspan patent litigation settlement in Orange County Superior Court,
asserting a claim under the unfair competition provision of the California
Business and Professions Code seeking injunctive relief, restitution, civil
penalties and attorneys' fees.

In August 2019, direct purchasers of AndroGel filed a lawsuit, King Drug Co.
of Florence, Inc., et al. v. AbbVie Inc., et al., against AbbVie and others in
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,
alleging that 2006 patent litigation settlements and related agreements by
Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company Abbott acquired in February 2010 and
now known as AbbVie Products LLC) with three generic companies violated
federal antitrust law, and also alleging that 2011 patent litigation by Abbott
with two generic companies regarding AndroGel was sham litigation and the
settlements of those litigations violated federal antitrust law. Plaintiffs
generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys' fees.
In November 2022, the State of Oregon filed a lawsuit in the Multnomah County,
Oregon Circuit Court making similar allegations regarding the 2011 patent
litigation with one of the generic companies.

Lawsuits are pending against Forest Laboratories, LLC, an AbbVie subsidiary,
and others generally alleging that 2009 and 2010 patent litigation settlements
involving Namenda entered into between Forest and generic companies and other
conduct by Forest involving Namenda, violated state antitrust, unfair and
deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally
seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. The
lawsuits, purported class actions filed by indirect purchasers of Namenda, are
consolidated as In re: Namenda Indirect Purchaser Antitrust Litigation in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In
November 2022, the parties reached an agreement to settle this matter that has
received preliminary court approval.

Lawsuits are pending against Forest Laboratories, LLC and others generally
alleging that 2012 and 2013 patent litigation settlements involving Bystolic
with six generic manufacturers violated federal and state antitrust laws and
state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws.
Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and
attorneys' fees. The lawsuits, purported class actions filed on behalf of
direct and indirect purchasers of Bystolic, are consolidated as In re:
Bystolic Antitrust Litigation in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York.

Government Proceedings

Lawsuits are pending against Allergan and several other manufacturers
generally alleging that they improperly promoted and sold prescription opioid
products. Approximately 3,000 matters are pending against Allergan. Most of
the federal court cases are consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the MDL rules as
In re: National Prescription Opiate Litigation, MDL No. 2804. Approximately
270 matters are pending in various state courts. The plaintiffs in these
cases, which include states, counties, cities, other municipal entities,
Native American tribes, union trust funds and other third-party payors,
private hospitals and personal injury claimants, generally seek compensatory
and punitive damages. In November 2022, Allergan finalized the terms of a
settlement with state and local government entities and Native American
tribes. That settlement is subject to certain conditions, including Allergan's
determination that a sufficient number of government entities elect to
participate in the settlement. AbbVie recorded a charge of $2.1 billion to
selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of
earnings in the second quarter of 2022 related to this potential settlement.

Shareholder and Securities Litigation

In June 2016, a lawsuit, Elliott Associates, L.P., et al. v. AbbVie Inc., was
filed by five investment funds against AbbVie in the Cook County, Illinois
Circuit Court alleging that AbbVie made misrepresentations and omissions in
connection with its proposed transaction with Shire. Similar lawsuits were
filed between July 2017 and October 2019 against AbbVie and in some instances
its chief executive officer in the same court by additional investment funds.
In September 2021, the Illinois court granted AbbVie's motion for summary
judgment on all pending claims in all pending cases, dismissing them with
prejudice. In November 2022, the Illinois appellate court affirmed summary
judgment in AbbVie's favor and, in December 2022, that court denied
plaintiffs' petition for rehearing.

In October 2018, a federal securities lawsuit, Holwill v. AbbVie Inc., et al.,
was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
Illinois against AbbVie, its chief executive officer and former chief
financial officer, alleging that reasons stated for Humira sales growth in
financial filings between 2013 and 2018 were misleading because they omitted
alleged misconduct in connection with Humira patient and reimbursement support
services and other services and items of value that allegedly induced Humira
prescriptions. In September 2021, the court granted plaintiffs' motion to
certify a class. In May 2022, a shareholder derivative lawsuit, Ranney v.
Gonzalez, et al., was filed in Delaware Chancery Court, alleging that

certain AbbVie directors and officers breached their fiduciary duties based on
related allegations. In December 2022, after AbbVie and the director/officer
defendants filed a motion to dismiss, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the
lawsuit with prejudice.

Lawsuits are pending against Allergan and certain of its current and former
officers alleging they made misrepresentations and omissions regarding
Allergan's textured breast implants. The lawsuits, which were filed by
Allergan shareholders, have been consolidated in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York as In re: Allergan plc Securities
Litigation. The plaintiffs generally seek compensatory damages and attorneys'
fees. In September 2019, the court partially granted Allergan's motion to
dismiss. In September 2021, the court granted plaintiffs' motion to certify a
class. In December 2022, the court granted Allergan's motion for summary
judgment on the remaining claims, dismissing them with prejudice. Plaintiffs
are appealing the court's motion to dismiss and summary judgment rulings.

In April 2022, a federal securities lawsuit, Nakata v. AbbVie Inc., was filed
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois
against AbbVie and certain officers alleging misstatements regarding the
potential effect that safety information about another company's product would
have on the Food and Drug Administration's approval and labeling for AbbVie's
Rinvoq. In May and July 2022, two shareholder derivative lawsuits, Treppel
Family Trust v. Gonzalez et al., and Katcher v. Gonzalez, et al., were filed
in the same court, alleging that certain AbbVie directors and officers
breached fiduciary and other legal duties based on related allegations.

Product Liability and General Litigation

In 2018, a qui tam lawsuit, U.S. ex rel. Silbersher v. Allergan Inc., et al.,
was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California against several Allergan entities and others, alleging that their
conduct before the U.S. Patent Office resulted in false claims for payment
being made to federal and state healthcare payors for Namenda XR and Namzaric.
The plaintiff-relator seeks damages and attorneys' fees under the federal
False Claims Act and state law analogues. The federal government and state
governments declined to intervene in the lawsuit. In August 2022, the United
States Court of Appeals reversed the district court's denial of Allergan's
motion to dismiss. The case has been remanded to the district court for
further proceedings consistent with that ruling.

Intellectual Property Litigation

Pharmacyclics LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of AbbVie, is seeking to enforce
its patent rights relating to ibrutinib tablets (a drug Pharmacyclics sells
under the trademark Imbruvica). Cases were filed in the United States District
Court for the District of Delaware in March 2019 against Alvogen Pine Brook
LLC and Natco Pharma Ltd. In August 2021, the court issued a decision holding
all asserted patents infringed and valid. The judgment precludes Defendants
from obtaining regulatory approval and launching until the last patent expires
in 2036. On August 30, 2021, Defendants appealed. On November 15, 2022, the
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the judgment. Janssen
Biotech, Inc. which is in a global collaboration with Pharmacyclics concerning
the development and marketing of Imbruvica, is the co-plaintiff in these
suits.

AbbVie Inc. is seeking to enforce patent rights relating to venetoclax (a drug
sold under the trademark Venclexta). Litigation was filed in the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware in July 2020 against Dr. Reddy's
Laboratories, Ltd. and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc.: and Alembic
Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Alembic Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Alembic Global
Holdings SA. AbbVie alleges defendants' proposed generic venetoclax products
infringe certain patents and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.
Genentech, Inc., which is in a global collaboration with AbbVie concerning the
development and marketing of Venclexta, is the co-plaintiff in this suit.

Note 16 Segment and Geographic Area Information| |  
---|---|---  
  
AbbVie operates as a single global business segment dedicated to the research
and development, manufacturing, commercialization and sale of innovative
medicines and therapies. This operating structure enables the Chief Executive
Officer, as chief operating decision maker (CODM), to allocate resources and
assess business performance on a global basis in order to achieve established
long-term strategic goals. Consistent with this structure, a global research
and development and supply chain organization is responsible for the
discovery, manufacturing and supply of products. Commercial efforts that
coordinate the marketing, sales and distribution of these products are
organized by geographic region or therapeutic area. All of these activities
are supported by a global corporate administrative staff. The determination of
a single business segment is consistent with the consolidated financial
information regularly reviewed by the CODM for purposes of assessing
performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of AbbVie Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AbbVie Inc.
and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related
consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and
the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In
our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and
our report dated February 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the
current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)
involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by
communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on
the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they
relate.

| | Sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs  
Description of the Matter| |

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under the
caption "Revenue Recognition," the Company established provisions for sales
rebates in the same period the related product is sold. At December 31, 2022,
the Company had $10,717 million in sales rebate accruals, a large portion of
which were for rebates provided to pharmacy benefit managers, state government
Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans and
private entities for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs. In order to
establish these sales rebate accruals, the Company estimated its rebates based
upon the identification of the products subject to a rebate, the applicable
price and rebate terms and the estimated lag time between the sale and payment
of the rebate.

Auditing the Medicaid, Medicare and managed care sales rebate accruals was
complex and required significant auditor judgment because the accruals
consider multiple subjective and complex estimates and assumptions. These
estimates and assumptions included the estimated inventory in the distribution
channel, which impacts the lag time between the sale to the customer and
payment of the rebate, and the final payer related to product sales, which
impacts the applicable price and rebate terms. In deriving these estimates and
assumptions, the Company used both internal and external sources of
information to estimate product in the distribution channels, payer mix,
prescription volumes and historical experience. Management supplemented its
historical data analysis with qualitative adjustments based upon changes in
rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or
other significant events which indicate a change in the reserve is
appropriate.  
  
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit| |

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating
effectiveness of controls over the Company's sales rebate accruals for
Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs. This included testing controls
over management's review of the significant assumptions and other inputs used
in the estimation of Medicaid, Medicare and managed care rebates, among
others, including the significant assumptions discussed above. The testing was
inclusive of management's controls to evaluate the accuracy of its reserve
judgments to actual rebates paid, rebate validation and processing, and
controls to ensure that the data used to evaluate and support the significant
assumptions was complete, accurate and, where applicable, verified to external
data sources.

To test the sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care
programs, our audit procedures included, among others, understanding and
evaluating the significant assumptions and underlying data used in
management's calculations. Our testing of significant assumptions included
corroboration to external data sources. We evaluated the reasonableness of
assumptions considering industry and economic trends, product profiles, and
other regulatory factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of management's
estimates by comparing actual activity to previous estimates and performed
analytical procedures, based on internal and external data sources, to
evaluate the completeness of the reserves. For Medicaid, we involved a
specialist with an understanding of statutory reimbursement requirements to
assess the consistency of the Company's calculation methodologies with
applicable government regulations and policy.

| | Valuation of contingent consideration  
Description of the Matter| |

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under the
caption "Business Combinations" and in Note 11 under the caption "Fair Value
Measures," the Company recognized contingent consideration liabilities at the
estimated fair value on the acquisition date in connection with applying the
acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Subsequent changes
to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities were recorded
within the consolidated statement of earnings in the period of change. At
December 31, 2022, the Company had $16,384 million in contingent consideration
liabilities, which represented a 'Level 3' fair value measurement in the fair
value hierarchy due to the significant unobservable inputs used in determining
the fair value and the use of management judgment about the assumptions market
participants would use in pricing the liabilities.

Auditing the valuation of contingent consideration liabilities was complex and
required significant auditor judgment due to the use of a Monte Carlo
simulation model and the high degree of subjectivity in evaluating certain
assumptions required to estimate the fair value of contingent royalty
payments. In particular, the fair value measurement was sensitive to the
significant assumptions underlying the estimated amount of future sales of the
acquired products. Management utilized its expertise within the industry,
including commercial dynamics, trends and utilization, as well as knowledge of
clinical development and regulatory approval processes to determine certain of
these assumptions.  
  
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit| |

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating
effectiveness of controls over the Company's contingent consideration
liabilities process including, among others, management's process to establish
the significant assumptions and measure the liability. This included testing
controls over management's review of the significant assumptions and other
inputs used in the determination of fair value. The testing was inclusive of
key management review controls to monitor and evaluate clinical development of
the acquired products and estimated future sales, and controls to ensure that
the data used to evaluate and support the significant assumptions was
complete, accurate and, where applicable, verified to external data sources.

To test the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, our
audit procedures included, among others, inspecting the terms of the executed
agreement, assessing the Monte Carlo simulation model used and testing the key
contractual inputs and significant assumptions discussed above. We evaluated
the assumptions and judgments considering observable industry and economic
trends and standards, external data sources and regulatory factors. Estimated
amounts of future sales were evaluated for reasonableness in relation to
internal and external analyses, clinical development progress and timelines,
probability of success benchmarks, and regulatory notices. Our procedures
included evaluating the data sources used by management in determining its
assumptions and, where necessary, included an evaluation of available
information that either corroborated or contradicted management's conclusions.
We involved a valuation specialist to assess the Company's Monte Carlo
simulation model and to perform corroborative fair value calculations.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE| |  
---|---|---  
  
None.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES| |  
---|---|---  
  
Disclosure Controls and Procedures; Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Chief Executive Officer,
Richard A. Gonzalez, and the Chief Financial Officer, Scott T. Reents,
evaluated the effectiveness of AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures as
of the end of the period covered by this report, and concluded that AbbVie's
disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information
AbbVie is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with
the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the Commission's rules and forms, and to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by AbbVie in the reports that it files or submits
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to
AbbVie's management, including its principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

Changes in internal control over financial reporting.  There were no changes
in AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, AbbVie's internal
control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022.

Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls. AbbVie's management,
including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, do not
expect that AbbVie's disclosure controls or internal control over financial
reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due
to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of
fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the
realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns
can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be
circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or
more people, or by management override of the controls.

The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any
design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future
periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance
with policies or procedures.

Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting.
Management of AbbVie is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule
13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. AbbVie's internal control
over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States. However, all internal control
systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,
even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting.

Management assessed the effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework (2013 framework). Based on that assessment, management concluded
that AbbVie maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.

The effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2022 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report
below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of AbbVie's
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.

AbbVie's independent registered public accounting firm related to its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance
sheets of AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the
related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022,
and the related notes and our report dated February 17, 2023 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying
Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to
the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting
was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
